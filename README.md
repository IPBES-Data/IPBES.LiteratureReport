# IPBES_Literature-Report

The repository contains the code to build the reports for the IPBES repositories.

To generate the reports, do the following:

1. Start R
2. Open the document `index.qmd`
3. Adjust the gropups defined in `download_groups` if necessary
4. Render `index.qmd` - that should it be.

This is all you should have to know.
