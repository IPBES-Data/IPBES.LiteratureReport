Honeybees (Apis mellifera), the prevailing managed insect crop pollinator, suffer from a range of emerging and exotic high-impact pathogens, and population maintenance requires active management by beekeepers to control them. Wild pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline, one cause of which may be pathogen spillover from managed pollinators like honeybees or commercial colonies of bumblebees. Here we use a combination of infection experiments and landscape-scale field data to show that honeybee EIDs are indeed widespread infectious agents within the pollinator assemblage. The prevalence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the exotic parasite Nosema ceranae in honeybees and bumblebees is linked; as honeybees have higher DWV prevalence, and sympatric bumblebees and honeybees are infected by the same DWV strains, Apis is the likely source of at least one major EID in wild pollinators. Lessons learned from vertebrates highlight the need for increased pathogen control in managed bee species to maintain wild pollinators, as declines in native pollinators may be caused by interspecies pathogen transmission originating from managed pollinators.","2014","2022-11-02 15:45:52","2022-11-02T15:45:52Z",NA,"364–6","","7488","506",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24553241",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The impact of pollinator declines remains unknown for species-rich plant communities found in temperate seminatural grasslands. We investigated effects of land-use intensity in the surrounding landscape on the distribution of plant traits related to insect pollination in 239 European seminatural grasslands. Increasing arable land use in the surrounding landscape consistently reduced the density of plants depending on bee and insect pollination. Similarly, the relative abundance of bee-pollination-dependent plants increased with higher proportions of non-arable agricultural land (e.g. permanent grassland). This was paralleled by an overall increase in bee abundance and diversity. By isolating the impact of the surrounding landscape from effects of local habitat quality, we show for the first time that grassland plants dependent on insect pollination are particularly susceptible to increasing land-use intensity in the landscape. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.","2014-09","2022-11-02 15:45:52","2022-11-02T15:45:52Z",NA,"1168–1177","","9","17",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25040328",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agricultural intensification; Bee specificity; Canopy height; Insect dependence; Leaf dry matter content; Mutualism disruption; Plant-pollinator interactions; Specific leaf area","/unread","Thuiller, Wilfried",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it is unclear how much biodiversity is needed to deliver ecosystem services in a cost-effective way. Here we show that, while the contribution of wild bees to crop production is significant, service delivery is restricted to a limited subset of all known bee species. Across crops, years and biogeographical regions, crop-visiting wild bee communities are dominated by a small number of common species, and threatened species are rarely observed on crops. Dominant crop pollinators persist under agricultural expansion and many are easily enhanced by simple conservation measures, suggesting that cost-effective management strategies to promote crop pollination should target a different set of species than management strategies to promote threatened bees. Conserving the biological diversity of bees therefore requires more than just ecosystem-service-based arguments.","2015","2022-11-02 15:45:50","2022-11-02T15:45:50Z",NA,"7414","","May","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 26079893",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; ipbes-pollination_chapter1","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Like predator?prey interactions, many mutualisms are also consumer?resource interactions. However, no studies have explored how the structure of plant? pollinator networks may be affected by nutrient enrichment. For three years, we enriched plots of subalpine plant communities with nitrogen and observed subsequent effects on plant?pollinator network structure. Although nitrogen enrichment affects floral abundance and rates of pollinator visitation, we found no effects of nitrogen enrichment on the core group of generalist plants and pollinators or on plant?pollinator network structure parameters, such as network topology (the identity and frequency of interactions) and the degree of nestedness. However, individual plant and pollinator taxa were packed into the nested networks differently among nitrogen treatments. In particular, pollinators visited different numbers and types of plants in the nested networks, suggesting weak, widespread effects of nitrogen addition on individual taxa. Independent of nitrogen enrichment, there were large interannual differences in network structure and interactions, due to species turnover among years and flexibility in interacting with new partners. These data suggest that the community structure of small-scale mutualistic networks may be relatively robust to short-term bottom?up changes in the resource supply, but sensitive to variation in the opportunistic behavior and turnover of plant and pollinator species among years.

The concept of using a transgenic approach was realized in the mid-1990s with the commercial introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops. By 2010, the global value of the seed alone was US $11.2 billion, with commercial biotech maize, soya bean grain and cotton valued at approximately US $150 billion. In recent years, it has become evident that insect-resistant crops expressing δ-endotoxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis have made a significant beneficial impact on global agriculture, not least in terms of pest reduction and improved quality. However, because of the potential for pest populations to evolve resistance, and owing to lack of effective control of homopteran pests, alternative strategies are being developed. Some of these are based on Bacillus spp. or other insect pathogens, while others are based on the use of plant- and animal-derived genes. However, if such approaches are to play a useful role in crop protection, it is desirable that they do not have a negative impact on beneficial organisms at higher trophic levels thus affecting the functioning of the agro-ecosystem. This widely held concern over the ecological impacts of GM crops has led to the extensive examination of the potential effects of a range of transgene proteins on non-target and beneficial insects. The findings to date with respect to both commercial and experimental GM crops expressing anti-insect genes are discussed here, with particular emphasis on insect predators and parasitoids.","2011","2022-11-02 15:45:30","2022-11-02T15:45:30Z",NA,"1438–1452","","1569","366",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Biological control; Food security; Genetically modified/biotech crops; Insecticidal proteins; Natural enemies (predators; Non-target effects; Parasitoids)","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As human communities and lighting technologies develop, artificial light increasingly modifies natural light regimes by encroaching on dark refuges in space, in time, and across wavelengths. A wide variety of ecological implications of artificial light have been identified. However, the primary research to date is largely focused on the disruptive influence of nighttime light on higher vertebrates, and while comprehensive reviews have been compiled along taxonomic lines and within specific research domains, the subject is in need of synthesis within a common mechanistic framework. Here we propose such a framework that focuses on the cross-factoring of the ways in which artificial lighting alters natural light regimes (spatially, temporally, and spectrally), and the ways in which light influences biological systems, particularly the distinction between light as a resource and light as an information source. We review the evidence for each of the combinations of this cross-factoring. As artificial lighting alters natural patterns of light in space, time and across wavelengths, natural patterns of resource use and information flows may be disrupted, with downstream effects to the structure and function of ecosystems. This review highlights: (i) the potential influence of nighttime lighting at all levels of biological organisation (from cell to ecosystem); (ii) the significant impact that even low levels of nighttime light pollution can have; and (iii) the existence of major research gaps, particularly in terms of the impacts of light at population and ecosystem levels, identification of intensity thresholds, and the spatial extent of impacts in the vicinity of artificial lights.","2013-11","2022-11-02 15:45:30","2022-11-02T15:45:30Z",NA,"912–927","","4","88",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23565807",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Dark; Information; Light; Moonlight; Night; Pollution; Resources; Rhythms; Time","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m.$\backslash$n3.

Hence, the long-term decline of managed honey bee hives in Europe and North-America is of great concern and stimulated intensive research into the possible factors presumably causing honey bee colony collapse.

Data on environmental factors, beekeeping management practice, and pesticides were also collected. All data were statistically analyzed in respect to the overwintering mortality of the colonies. We can demonstrate for several factors that they are significantly related to the observed winter losses of the monitored honey bee colonies: (i) high varroa infestation level, (ii) infection with deformed wing virus (DWV) and acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) in autumn, (iii) queen age, and (iv) weakness of the colonies in autumn.

With agricultural intensification, increasing urbanisation is among the main drivers of habitat loss. Consequently studies focusing on pollinator community structure along urbanisation gradients have increased in recent years. However, few studies have investigated how urbanisation affects plant-pollinator interaction networks. Here we assessed modifications of plant-pollinator interactions along an urbanisation gradient based on the study of their morphological relationships. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Along an urbanisation gradient comprising four types of landscape contexts (semi-natural, agricultural, suburban, urban), we set up experimental plant communities containing two plant functional groups differing in their morphological traits (""open flowers"" and ""tubular flowers""). Insect visitations on these communities were recorded to build plant-pollinator networks. A total of 17 857 interactions were recorded between experimental plant communities and flower-visitors. The number of interactions performed by flower-visitors was significantly lower in urban landscape context than in semi-natural and agricultural ones. In particular, insects such as Syrphidae and solitary bees that mostly visited the open flower functional group were significantly impacted by urbanisation, which was not the case for bumblebees. Urbanisation also impacted the generalism of flower-visitors and we detected higher interaction evenness in urban landscape context than in agricultural and suburban ones. Finally, in urban context, these modifications lowered the potential reproductive success of the open flowers functional group. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show that open flower plant species and their specific flower-visitors are especially sensitive to increasing urbanisation. These results provide new clues to improve conservation measures within urbanised areas in favour of specialist flower-visitors. To complete this functional approach, studies using networks resolved to the species level along urbanised gradients would be required.","2013","2022-11-02 15:45:24","2022-11-02T15:45:24Z",NA,"5","","5","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we reviewed the literature and developed a database of interactions between pollinators and agricultural crops for Brazil. We classified the pollinators as effective, occasional, or potential, and also identified those species quoted simply as “visitors” (without reference to pollination).We found 250 crop pollinators pertaining to the three categories quoted, with 168 effective ones. Besides, we identified the effective pollinators of 75 agricultural crops. Bees pertaining to the family Apidae, mainly those from the genera Melipona , Xylocopa, Centris , and Bombus ,were reportedly the most effective pollinators of agricultural crops.We also found that the exotic managed species Apis mellifera and the stingless bee Trigona spinipes are effective pollinators of some crops. In spite of some data having been originated from gray literature and the taxonomic impediment, this effort is a crucial step to clarify the gaps and bias on data. This study is the first to attempt to build, analyze, and make available a comprehensive data set about pollinators of agricultural crops in a country level, aiming to contribute to protective measures and to enhance the sustainable use of native pollinators in agriculture.","2015","2022-11-02 15:45:21","2022-11-02T15:45:21Z",NA,"209–223","","2","46",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apoidea; agriculture; bees; ecosystem services; pollination","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agri- cultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. 2. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. 3. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (k-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. 4. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging perfor- mance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. 5. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators.

The aim of this observational study was to determine the impact of surrounding pollen diversity on the health of honey bee colonies introduced in lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) in June and cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) in July. The results suggest that monocultures of lowbush blueberries are not suitable for optimal brood rearing. In the blueberry environments we studied, the dominant pollen collected by honey bees were Alnus Mill. spp. and Taraxacum officinale F. H. Wigg., which are deficient in some essential amino acids. Significant reduction of brood rearing during honey bees' stay in blueberry monocultures in June may, therefore, be explained by nutritional deficiencies. In July, the polliniferous flora in the vicinity of cranberry monocultures was poorer but of better nutritional quality. Pollen analysis allowed the identification of Brassicaceae, Trifolium L. spp., and V. macrocarpon as the three dominant taxa collected by honey bees during this period. The complete lists of plant taxa foraged by honey bees for pollen during the pollination of lowbush blueberries and cranberries are provided.","2012","2022-11-02 15:45:20","2022-11-02T15:45:20Z",NA,"545–555","","7","90",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bumblebees are important pollinators in North America and are attacked by a range of parasites that impact their fitness; however, few studies have investigated the extent or causes of parasitism in North America. 2. This study used a 2-year multi-site survey of bumblebee parasitism to ask: (i) how common are parasitoid conopid flies and the internal parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi in Massachusetts; and (ii) what factors are correlated with parasitism? 3. Infection rates by all three parasites were higher in this study than previously documented in North America. Overall, conopids infected 0–73% of bees in each sample, C. bombi infected 0–82% of bees, and N. bombi infected 0–32%. 4. Conopid flies infected female bees more than males and intermediate-sized bees more than large or small bees. Crithidia bombi infection rates were higher in certain bee species and sites, and exhibited a unimodal pattern of prevalence over time. Nosema bombi parasitism was higher in male than female bees. 5. Infection by N. bombi in two rare bumblebee species was higher than expected based on parasitism rates of common bee species but C. bombi infection was lower. If high prevalence of N. bombi in these bumblebee species is common, parasitism may be a potential cause of their decline. 6. Given the documented effects of these parasites, the high levels of infection may affect bee populations in Massachusetts and threaten the stability of their valuable ecosystem services.","2010","2022-11-02 15:45:20","2022-11-02T15:45:20Z",NA,"737–747","","6","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bombus; Bumblebee; Conopidae; Crithidia bombi; Nosema bombi; Parasitism","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, imported from the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Japanese native species, B. ignitus, imported from the Netherlands, between 1997 and 2001. We detected mites in natural populations of the two B. hypocrita subspecies and in the commercial colonies. Analysis of variations in 535 bp sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene showed that the mite haplotypes in the native populations and in the imported colonies did not overlap in 1997-1999, but in 2000-2001 some mites possessing European CO1 haplotypes were detected in the natural populations of Japanese native bumblebees. In addition, many mites possessing Japanese haplotypes were detected in the imported commercial colonies from Europe. Considering the fact that the Japanese native bumblebees, B. hypocrita, were once exported to Europe for commercialization, these results suggest that bumblebee commercialization has caused overseas migration and cross-infestation of parasitic mites among natural and commercial colonies. However, because the Japanese and European CO1 haplotypes were closely related, there was a possibility that the European haplotypes found in the mites in the Hokkaido Island revealed native variation.

As a result several bee species have been introduced to countries far beyond their home range, including A. mellifera, bumblebees (Bombus sp.), the alfalfa leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata, and various other solitary species. Possible negative consequences of these introductions include: competition with native pollinators for floral resources; competition for nest sites; co-introduction of natural enemies, particularly pathogens that may infect native organisms; pollination of exotic weeds; and disruption of pollination of native plants. For most exotic bee species little or nothing is known of these possible effects. Research to date has focused mainly on A. mellifera, and has largely been concerned with detecting competition with native flower visitors. Considerable circumstantial evidence has accrued that competition does occur, but no experiment has clearly demonstrated long-term reductions in populations of native organisms. Most researchers agree that this probably reflects the difficulty of carrying out convincing studies of competition between such mobile organisms, rather than a genuine absence of competitive effects. Effects on seed set of exotic weeds are easier to demonstrate. Exotic bees often exhibit marked preferences for visiting flowers of exotic plants. For example, in Australia and New Zealand many weeds from Europe are now visited by European honeybees and bumblebees. Introduced bees are primary pollinators of a number of serious weeds. Negative impacts of exotic bees need to be carefully assessed before further introductions are carried out.[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","2003","2022-11-02 15:45:10","2022-11-02T15:45:10Z",NA,"1–26","","1","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dynamic factor analyses performed with plant phenophases showed that most of those events occurring at spring and summer had common trends toward the advancement, especially since mid-1970s. However, during these last decades, insect phenology showed a steeper advance than plant phenology, suggesting an increase of decoupling of some plant-insect interactions, such as those between pollinators and flowers or herbivorous insects and their plant resources. All trans-Saharan bird species showed highly significant temporal trends in all studied phenophases (some of them covering most of the last century). In two species, the duration of stay is increasing due to both earlier arrivals and later departures. On the other hand, two wintering species showed a significant advancement in their arrival dates, while an opposite pattern were found for departures of each one. Only one of these species increased significantly its wintering stay. Bird departures were not related to local climate in any species. Our results demonstrate a key role of local temperatures behind interannual variability of most plant and insects phenophases, with especial emphasis in those occurring in spring and summer.

They are water soluble and prone to leaching into waterways. Being systemic, they are found in nectar and pollen of treated crops. Reported levels in soils, waterways, field margin plants and floral resources overlap substantially with concentrations that are sufficient to control pests in crops, and commonly exceed the LC50 (the concentration which kills 50% of individuals) for beneficial organisms. Concentrations in nectar and pollen in crops are sufficient to impact substantially on colony reproduction in bumblebees. 4. Although vertebrates are less susceptible than arthropods, consumption of small numbers of dressed seeds offers a route to direct mortality in birds and mammals. 5. Synthesis and applications. Major knowledge gaps remain, but current use of neonicotinoids is likely to be impacting on a broad range of non-target taxa including pollinators and soil and aquatic invertebrates and hence threatens a range of ecosystem services. Given the scale of use of neonicotinoids, their persistence in soils, leaching into waterways and their systemic nature within plants, there is no doubt that most organisms inhabiting arable environments will be exposed to them. The key question is whether typical levels of exposure are likely to lead to significant individual- or population-level impacts. Many studies have examined the toxicity of neonicotinoids to both target and non-target organisms, including mammals, birds, fish, insects, crustacean, molluscs and annelids (Table S1 in Supporting Information). Insects are consistently among the most sensitive taxa, whether exposed via contact or ingestion. Typical LD50 values vary from 082 to 88 ng per insect, with much of the variation between species due to the size of the insect (Table S1, Supporting Information). For example, the most sensitive species, the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, weighs approximately 1 mg, while the least sensitive, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, weighs approximately 130 mg, so that the LD50 values expressed as ng mg body per weight are similar (082 and 067, respectively). LC50 values (the concentration which kills 50% of individuals) for aquatic insects vary from 065 to 44 ppb (Table S1, Supporting Information). Here, the variation between studies is partly explained by differences in the duration of exposure. For example, the LC50 for the mayfly Epeorus longimanus falls from 21 ppb at 24 h to 065 ppb at 96 h (Alexander et al. 2007). Most studies assess only mortality and are carried out over short periods, but it is clear that important sublethal effects (such as reduced feeding, movement and reproduction) can be elicited by much lower doses. For example, feeding of E. longimanus nymphs was reduced for 4 days following exposure to water containing 01 ppb of imidacloprid for 24 h (Alexander et al. 2007). The widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids has led to some insect pests developing resistance (e.g. Horowitz, Kontsedalov & Ishaaya 2004; Szendrei et al. 2012). For example, Szendrei et al. (2012) describe Colorado potato beetle populations with a 26-fold increase in resistance to thiamethoxam and a 100-fold increase in resistance to imidacloprid. The first strains with increased resistance to imidacloprid were detected in 1998, just 3 years after the chemical was first used against this pest. Given the increasing ubiquity of neonicotinoids and their persistence, insect populations in arable ecosystems are likely to be chronically exposed to them, a situation which will inevitably lead to increasing resistance in pest species (which tend to have large populations and short generation times). Studies of toxicity to crustaceans are few, but they appear to be highly variable in their susceptibility to neonicotinoids, with LC50 values ranging from 71 ppb (over 28 days) in the amphipod Hyalella azteca to 361 000 ppb (over 48 h) in the brine shrimp Artemia sp. (Table S1, Supporting Information). Most crustaceans are considerably less susceptible than insects. Studies of annelids are also scarce, but suggest lower susceptibility than insects (Table S1, Supporting Information). Toxicity to vertebrates is also low compared to insects, but varies greatly among neonicotinoids; for example, the LD50 value in rats varies from 140 mg kgbw 1 (mg of active ingredient per kilogram body weight) for acetamiprid up to 5000 mg kgbw 1 for clothianidin (Table S1, Supporting Information). Birds appear to be generally more susceptible than rats, with LD50 values ranging from 14 mg kgbw 1 for imidacloprid in grey partridge up to 1333 mg kgbw 1 for clothianidin in mallard ducks. Fish are markedly less susceptible than aquatic insects, with LC50 values ranging from 16 to 177 ppm (parts per million; Table S1, Supporting Information). Typically, maize seeds are treated with ∼1 mg of active ingredient per seed, beet seeds with 09 mg and the much smaller oilseed rape seeds with 017 mg (Rexrode et al. 2003; Anon 2012; Krupke et al. 2012). A grey partridge, typically weighing approximately 390 g, therefore needs to eat ∼5 maize seeds, six beet seeds or 32 oilseed rape seeds to receive an LD50. A grey partridge typically consumes ∼25 g of seeds per day (Liukkonen-Anttila, Putaala & Hissa 1999), equivalent to ∼600 maize seeds, so clearly there is the potential for birds to swiftly consume a lethal dose. By a similar calculation, three maize seeds treated with imidacloprid would deliver more than the LD50 to a mouse. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimated that ∼1% of drilled seeds remain accessible to granivorous vertebrates (i.e. they are not buried during drilling), and this does not include spillages which may occur, for example, when transporting grain or loading hoppers. With typical sowing rates of ∼50 000 seeds ha 1 for maize and 800 000 seeds ha 1 for oilseed rape, we might expect sufficient seed to be available on the soil surface to deliver an LD50 to 100 partridge or 167 mice for every hectare sown. Overall, the balance of evidence at present suggests that field-realistic exposure of bees to neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen of seed-treated crops is unlikely to cause substantial direct mortality (although exposure to dust released during drilling can cause direct mortality, Marzaro et al. 2011; Tapparo et al. 2012). However, only honeybees and bumblebees have been investigated; no information is available of susceptibility of other pollinating taxa such as hoverflies or butterflies. Also, if pollinators forage on crops treated with neonicotinoids via irrigation water or as a foliar application, direct mortality is likely; this has not yet been investigated, with attention largely focussed on exposure of bees to seed-treated crops. Although there is little convincing evidence for direct mortality in bees, there is strong evidence for important sublethal effects. Exposure to sublethal doses of neonicotinoids is known to reduce learning, foraging ability and homing ability in both honeybees and bumblebees (Yang et al. 2008; Han et al. 2010; Mommaerts et al. 2010; Henry et al. 2012). Such effects will not be revealed in standard safety-testing protocols that typically involve laboratory or cage trials with ad lib food, but would be much more marked under natural conditions when colonies rely on their workers to locate patches of flowers across the landscape. However, very few studies have been carried out in which bees that have been exposed to pesticides have to navigate across realistic distances. In one such study, Henry et al. (2012) showed that honeybees, after being fed with sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, had a lower chance of finding their home colony than control bees. Importantly, the effect was much stronger when foragers had to return from an unfamiliar location at 1 km from their hive, compared to familiar locations or when closer to the hive. However, the dose given was higher than that bees might commonly be expected to receive in a single feed. Recently Gill, Ramos-Rodriguez & Raine (2012) found that bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers from colonies exposed to field-realistic concentrations of imidacloprid in nectar suffered from impaired foraging ability when gathering food in a natural setting, particularly when collecting pollen. As a result, treated colonies grew more slowly. They recorded reduced nest growth and an 85% drop in queen production resulting from exposure to imidacloprid compared to control colonies. colonies. This study and Gill, Ramos-Rodriguez & Raine (2012) provide complementary evidence that reduced foraging efficiency following exposure to realistic levels of imidacloprid can result in a strong colony-level effect, which is likely to impact upon bumblebee populations in the long term. However, both studies placed treated food in the nests (and in the case of Whitehorn et al., no other food was provided during the exposure phase), so we cannot be certain that the concentrations to which bees were exposed are representative of what happens under field conditions. For example, if bees detect and avoid neonicotinoid-treated crops, they may be exposed to less that we would otherwise expect. Easton & Goulson (2013) demonstrate that pollinating flies and beetles avoid pan traps containing imidacloprid at as low as 001 ppb, but whether bees avoid contaminated crops is unknown. If they do, this could have consequences for crop pollination. Studies to date have focussed almost exclusively on exposure of adult bees. However, Yang et al. (2012) recently showed that learning of adult bees was impaired if they had been treated with 004 ng larva 1 of imidacloprid in the larval stage (\textless1/100th of the LC50 for adult bees). It seems highly likely that bee larvae are routinely exposed to such very low concentrations, but we have no data on whether this has long-term repercussio","2013","2022-11-02 15:45:08","2022-11-02T15:45:08Z",NA,"977–987","","4","50",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; bee; clothianidin; environmental fate; half‐life; imidacloprid; non‐target wildlife; soil water; systemic insecticide","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The causes of bee declines remain hotly debated, particularly the contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides. In 2013 the UK's Food & Environment Research Agency made public a study of the impacts of exposure of bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoids. The study concluded that there was no clear relationship between colony performance and pesticide exposure, and the study was subsequently cited by the UK government in a policy paper in support of their vote against a proposed moratorium on some uses of neonicotinoids. Here I present a simple re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices. It strongly suggests that wild bumblebee colonies in farmland can be expected to be adversely affected by exposure to neonicotinoids.","2015","2022-11-02 15:45:08","2022-11-02T15:45:08Z",NA,"e854","","","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The causes of this decline are still not clear. This study was set out to evaluate the pesticide residues in stored pollen from honey bee colonies and their possible impact on honey bee losses in Spain. In total, 1,021 professional apiaries were randomly selected. All pollen samples were subjected to multiresidue analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( MS ) and liquid chromatography-MS; moreover, specific methods were applied for neonicotinoids and fipronil. A palynological analysis also was carried out to confirm the type of foraging crop. Pesticide residues were detected in 42% of samples collected in spring, and only in 31% of samples collected in autumn. Fluvalinate and chlorfenvinphos were the most frequently detected pesticides in the analyzed samples. Fipronil was detected in 3.7% of all the spring samples but never in autumn samples, and neonicotinoid residues were not detected. More than 47.8% of stored pollen samples belonged to wild vegetation, and sunflower (Heliantus spp.) pollen was only detected in 10.4% of the samples. A direct relation between pesticide residues found in stored pollen samples and colony losses was not evident accordingly to the obtained results. Further studies are necessary to determine the possible role of the most frequent and abundant pesticides (such as acaricides) and the synergism among them and with other pathogens more prevalent in Spain. ? 2010 Entomological Society of America.","2011","2022-11-02 15:45:06","2022-11-02T15:45:06Z",NA,"1964–1971","","6","103",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The existing test guidelines were evaluated and suggestions for improvement and further research needs were listed. A simple prioritisation tool to assess cumulative effects of single pesticides using mortality data is suggested. Effects from repeated and simultanous exposure and synergism are discussed.

We test with meta-analysis whether the benefits of AEM for species richness and abundance of plants and animals are determined by the surrounding landscape context. Across all studies (109 observations for species richness and 114 observations for abundance), AEM significantly increased species richness and their abundance. More specifically, we test the hypothesis that AEM benefits species richness and abundance (i.e. increases the difference between fields with and without AEM) more in simple than in complex landscapes. In croplands, species richness but not abundance was significantly enhanced in simple but not in complex landscapes. In grasslands, AEM effectively enhanced species richness and abundance regardless of landscape context. Pollinators were significantly enhanced by AEM in simple but not in complex landscapes in both croplands and grasslands. Our results highlight that the one-size-fits-all approach of many agri-environmental programmes is not an efficient way of spending the limited funds available for biodiversity conservation on farmland. Therefore, we conclude that AEM should be adapted to landscape structure and the species groups at which they are targeted.","2011","2022-11-02 15:45:04","2022-11-02T15:45:04Z",NA,"1894–1902","","1713","278",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agri-environment schemes; Complex landscape; Cropland; Grassland; Organic farming; Simple landscape","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet the distribution of these subspecies is nowadays also much influenced by beekeeping activities. Large scale migratory bee-keeping and trade in queens, coupled with the promiscuous mating system of honeybees, have exposed native European honeybees to increasing introgressive hybridization with managed non-native subspecies, which may lead to the loss of valuable combinations of traits shaped by natural selection. Other threats to European honeybees are factors that have caused a progressive decline in A. mellifera throughout the world in recent years, leading to large economic losses and jeopardizing ecosystem functioning. We review the biodiversity of European honeybees and summarize the management and conservation strategies employed by different countries. A comprehensive picture of the beekeeping industry in Europe is also provided. Finally we evaluate the potential threats affecting the biodiversity of European honeybee populations and provide some perspectives for future research.","2009","2022-11-02 15:45:03","2022-11-02T15:45:03Z",NA,"263–284","","3","40",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of plant-pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant-pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics.","2008","2022-11-02 15:45:03","2022-11-02T15:45:03Z",NA,"0396–0403","","2","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the current initiative, the biological effects on gene expression within spot prawn (Pandalus platyceros) exposed to the sea lice controlling agent, emamectin benzoate (EB; 0.1-4.8mg/kg sediment), were investigated. A mean sediment/water partitioning coefficient (K(p)) was determined to be 21.81 and significant levels of EB were detected in the tail muscle tissue in all exposed animals. Animals selected for the experiment did not have eggs and were of similar weight. Significant mortality was observed within 8 days of EB treatment at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.8mg/kg and there was no effect of EB on molting. Twelve spot prawn cDNA sequences were isolated from the tail muscle either by directed cloning or subtractive hybridization of control versus EB exposed tissues. Three of the transcripts most affected by EB exposure matched sequences encoding the 60S ribosomal protein L22, spliceosome RNA helicase WM6/UAP56, and the intracellular signal mediator histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 suggesting that translation, transcription regulation, and apoptosis pathways were impacted. The mRNA encoding the molting enzyme, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, was not affected by EB treatment. However, the expression of this transcript was extremely variable making it unsuitable for effects assessment. The results suggest that short-term exposure to EB can impact biological processes within this non-target crustacean.","2002","2022-11-02 15:45:02","2022-11-02T15:45:02Z",NA,"","107–127","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.10.015 PMID: 22088864",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One route by which honey bees and other insects might combat disease is through the shielding effects of their microbial symbionts. Bees carry a diverse assemblage of bacteria, very few of which appear to be pathogenic. Here we explore the inhibitory effects of these resident bacteria against the primary bacterial pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae. Results: Here we isolate, culture, and describe by 16S rRNA and protein-coding gene sequences 61 bacterial isolates from honey bee larvae, reflecting a total of 43 distinct bacterial taxa. We culture these bacteria alongside the primary larval pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae, and show that many of these isolates severely inhibit the growth of this pathogen. Accordingly, symbiotic bacteria including those described here are plausible natural antagonists toward this widespread pathogen. Conclusion: The results suggest a tradeoff in social insect colonies between the maintenance of potentially beneficial bacterial symbionts and deterrence at the individual and colony level of pathogenic species. They also provide a novel mechanism for recently described social components behind disease resistance in insect colonies, and point toward a potential control strategy for an important bee disease. © 2006 Evans and Armstrong; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2006","2022-11-02 15:45:01","2022-11-02T15:45:01Z",NA,"4","","1","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 16551367",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Adaptation; Animals; Bacteria; Bacteria: genetics; Bacteria: isolation & purification; Bacteria: pathogenicity; Bees; Bees: microbiology; Immunity; Innate; Larva; Larva: microbiology; Physiological; RNA; Ribosomal; Social Behavior; Symbiosis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, foraging areas are currently affected by the intensification of agriculture and landscape alteration. Bees are therefore confronted to disparities in time and space of floral resource abundance, type and diversity, which might provide inadequate nutrition and endanger colonies. The beneficial influence of pollen availability on bee health is well-established but whether quality and diversity of pollen diets can modify bee health remains largely unknown. We therefore tested the influence of pollen diet quality (different monofloral pollens) and diversity (polyfloral pollen diet) on the physiology of young nurse bees, which have a distinct nutritional physiology (e.g. hypopharyngeal gland development and vitellogenin level), and on the tolerance to the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae by measuring bee survival and the activity of different enzymes potentially involved in bee health and defense response (glutathione-S-transferase (detoxification), phenoloxidase (immunity) and alkaline phosphatase (metabolism)). We found that both nurse bee physiology and the tolerance to the parasite were affected by pollen quality. Pollen diet diversity had no effect on the nurse bee physiology and the survival of healthy bees. However, when parasitized, bees fed with the polyfloral blend lived longer than bees fed with monofloral pollens, excepted for the protein-richest monofloral pollen. Furthermore, the survival was positively correlated to alkaline phosphatase activity in healthy bees and to phenoloxydase activities in infected bees. Our results support the idea that both the quality and diversity (in a specific context) of pollen can shape bee physiology and might help to better understand the influence of agriculture and land-use intensification on bee nutrition and health.","2013","2022-11-02 15:44:59","2022-11-02T15:44:59Z",NA,"e72016","","8","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23940803",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both biotic and abiotic factors are involved in this phenomenon that is often associated with high loads of parasites and pathogens. A stronger impact of pathogens in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported, but the causal link between insecticide exposure and the possible immune alteration of honey bees remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin negatively modulates NF-κB immune signaling in insects and adversely affects honey bee antiviral defenses controlled by this transcription factor. We have identified in insects a negative modulator of NF-κB activation, which is a leucine-rich repeat protein. Exposure to clothianidin, by enhancing the transcription of the gene encoding this inhibitor, reduces immune defenses and promotes the replication of the deformed wing virus in honey bees bearing covert infections. This honey bee immunosuppression is similarly induced by a different neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, but not by the organophosphate chlorpyriphos, which does not affect NF-κB signaling. The occurrence at sublethal doses of this insecticide-induced viral proliferation suggests that the studied neonicotinoids might have a negative effect at the field level. Our experiments uncover a further level of regulation of the immune response in insects and set the stage for studies on neural modulation of immunity in animals. Furthermore, this study has implications for the conservation of bees, as it will contribute to the definition of more appropriate guidelines for testing chronic or sublethal effects of pesticides used in agriculture.","2013","2022-11-02 15:44:58","2022-11-02T15:44:58Z",NA,"18466–18471","","46","110",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nine landscapes were selected differing in percent intensively used agricultural area (IAA), each with a pair of organic and conventional winter wheat fields and a pair of organic and conventional meadows. Within fields, forbs were surveyed at the edge and in the interior. Both diversity and cover of forbs were positively affected by organic management in meadows and wheat fields. This effect, however, differed significantly between pollination types for species richness in both agroecosystem types (i.e. wheat fields and meadows) and for cover in meadows. Thus, we show for the first time in a comprehensive analysis that insect-pollinated plants benefit more from organic management than non-insect pollinated plants regardless of agroecosystem type and landscape complexity. These benefits were more pronounced in meadows than wheat fields. Finally, the community composition of insect-pollinated and non-insect-pollinated forbs differed considerably between management types. In summary, our findings in both agroecosystem types indicate that organic management generally supports a higher species richness and cover of insect-pollinated plants, which is likely to be favourable for the density and diversity of bees and other pollinators.","2013","2022-11-02 15:44:58","2022-11-02T15:44:58Z",NA,"1","","1","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A questionnaire was used to gauge attitudes to pesticide use whilst inventories of active ingredients were taken for all farms. The age profiles of the respondents were broadly similar, as was the distribution of nationalities amongst the workers. Workers and owners of FA farms were better educated than respondents from non-member farms. A majority of non-FA farm workers reported that they always used pesticides, fewer FA member farm workers and non-FA farm owners reported this behaviour with FA owners showing the lowest proportion of respondents who always used pesticides. Responses amongst farm owners to questions about frequency of pesticide use suggested that this was unaffected by age or education status, but for farm workers younger or less well educated respondents were more likely to respond by indicating that pesticides were always used. When asked to rate pesticides on a scale of 1 (bad) to 10 (good), high responses were most frequent amongst non-FA farm workers followed by FA member farm workers and non-FA farm owners. On average FA farm owners had the lowest average response, and responses by all groups were unaffected by age or education status. Prohibited pesticide use was higher on non-FA farms (4.9% of all pesticides) than on FA farms (1.3%). Pesticide products observed on FA member farms generally contained newer classes of active ingredients and were most frequently from major manufacturing companies in Europe, North America and Japan. Older, off-patent active ingredient-containing products were frequently observed on non-FA farms, often from so-called 'me-too' producing companies in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:56","2022-11-02T15:44:56Z",NA,"505–512","","","476-477",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Farmers' Association; Oman; Pesticide use; Risk aversion","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using fruit-baited traps, we conducted rapid evaluations in 1993 and 1994 of the forest butterlly diversity of seven small patches (3-30 ha) and a single remaining large patch (227 ha) of Costa Rican mid-elevation moist forest. Our results suggest that even recently isolated 20-30 ha fragments of primary forest retain surprisingly depauperate butterfly faunas relative to that supported by the 227 ha patch only OS-l.0 km away. If forest butterflies are an index of the diversity of small-bodied organisms in general, preservation of the latter may require unexpectedly large patches. In 1994 we also surveyed a 16 ha botanical garden, situated between and contiguous to both the 227 ha patch and an exceptionally species-rich 25 ha patch. In the garden, we discovered adults of many butterfly species associated with forest interior, suggesting that even heavily managed systems of largely exotic plants (such as agricultural systems) could be designed to serve as corridors for butterflies and perhaps some other groups of organisms. We discuss some implications for a planned restoration of biotic connections between lowland and montane forests in southern Costa Rica.","1995","2022-11-02 15:44:55","2022-11-02T15:44:55Z",NA,"35–55","","1","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 409",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; biodiversity; butterflies; conservation; corridors; restoration; species richness; tropical moist forest fragments","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Vertebrate conservation strategies routinely consider genetic factors, but their importance in invertebrate populations is poorly understood. Bumblebees are important pollinators, and many species have undergone dramatic declines. As monoandrous social hymenopterans they may be particularly susceptible to inbreeding due to low effective population sizes. We study fragmented populations of a bumblebee species, on a model island system, and on mainland Great Britain where it is rare and declining. We use microsatellites to study: population genetic structuring and gene flow; the relationships between genetic diversity, population size and isolation; and frequencies of (sterile) diploid males - an indicator of inbreeding. We find significant genetic structuring ($þeta$ = 0.12) and isolation by distance. Populations \textgreater 10 km apart are all significantly differentiated, both on oceanic islands and on the mainland. Genetic diversity is reduced relative to closely related common species, and isolated populations exhibit further reductions. Of 16 populations, 10 show recent bottlenecking, and 3 show diploid male production. These results suggest that surviving populations of this rare insect suffer from inbreeding as a result of geographical isolation.

Here we used long term monitoring of colonies and screening for eleven disease agents and genes involved in bee immunity and physiology to identify predictive markers of honeybee colony losses during winter. The data show that DWV, Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor and Vitellogenin can be predictive markers for winter colony losses, but their predictive power strongly depends on the season. In particular, the data support that V. destructor is a key player for losses, arguably in line with its specific impact on the health of individual bees and colonies.","2012","2022-11-02 15:44:54","2022-11-02T15:44:54Z",NA,"2","","2","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The status of the eastern North American monarch butterfly population is a highly sensitive issue, given that winter and breeding habitats are being lost at an alarming rate each year, and because of this, most believe the population to be declining, although there has been little empirical data to support this idea. In a recent forum article of this journal, Brower et al. (2011) report a statistically significant decline in winter colony size over a 17-year period and suggest that this is the first sign of impending collapse. 2. I conducted an analysis of numbers of migrating monarchs from two fall monitoring stations in the United States (Cape May, NJ and Peninsula Point, MI), which span 15 and 19 years, respectively, and at both locations there was no significant linear trend in average monarch numbers counted over time, which is in marked contrast to the conclusion drawn by Brower et al. (2011). 3. Although I identify several possible reasons for the discrepancy between the fall census counts and size of the overwintering areas, these differing patterns argue for a more balanced perspective regarding the status of this population, and certainly for considering more than one phase of the life cycle. Even though it is difficult to imagine how monarchs will fare in the future with so many threats to their population, the data presented here suggest that the population remains stable for now, probably because of the high fecundity of the species and its ability to rebound from small winter numbers.","2012","2022-11-02 15:44:53","2022-11-02T15:44:53Z",NA,"101–105","","2","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Danaus plexippus; Migration censuses; Monarch butterflies; Overwintering colonies; Population status","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Genetic studies provide insights into population structure that are crucial for conservation management but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary bees. Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus F(ST) was up to 0.53, and and D(est) were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C. floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight the need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline of this and potentially other rare solitary bees.","2010","2022-11-02 15:44:52","2022-11-02T15:44:52Z",NA,"4922–4935","","22",19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; conservation; dispersal; landscape genetics; management unit; mining bee; population structure","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, for reasons that are still not fully understood, the transmission of DWV by V. destructor to the developing pupae causes clinical symptoms, including pupal death and adult bees emerging with deformed wings, a bloated, shortened abdomen and discolouration. These bees are not viable and die soon after emergence.

Comparisons of organic and conventional yields play a central role in this debate. We therefore compiled and analyzed a meta-dataset of 362 published organic–conventional comparative crop yields. Our results show that organic yields of individual crops are on average 80% of conventional yields, but variation is substantial (standard deviation 21%). In our dataset, the organic yield gap significantly differed between crop groups and regions. The analysis gave some support to our hypothesis that the organic–conventional yield gap increases as conventional yields increase, but this relationship was only rather weak. The rationale behind this hypothesis is that when conventional yields are high and relatively close to the potential or water-limited level, nutrient stress must, as per definition of the potential or water-limited yield levels, be low and pests and diseases well controlled, which are conditions more difficult to attain in organic agriculture. We discuss our findings in the context of the literature on this subject and address the issue of upscaling our results to higher system levels. Our analysis was at field and crop level. We hypothesize that due to challenges in the maintenance of nutrient availability in organic systems at crop rotation, farm and regional level, the average yield gap between conventional and organic systems may be larger than 20% at higher system levels. This relates in particular to the role of legumes in the rotation and the farming system, and to the availability of (organic) manure at the farm and regional levels. Future research should therefore focus on assessing the relative performance of both types of agriculture at higher system levels, i.e. the farm, regional and global system levels, and should in that context pay particular attention to nutrient availability in both organic and conventional agriculture.","2012","2022-11-02 15:44:49","2022-11-02T15:44:49Z",NA,"1–9","","",108,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although land-use changes have been advanced as the major causes, the affinities of most wild pollinators with the main land-use types remain unknown. Filling this gap in our knowledge is a prerequisite to improving conservation and management programmes. Methodology/Principal Findings: We estimated the affinity of flower visitors with urban, agricultural and natural land-uses using data from a country-wide scale monitoring scheme based on citizen science (Spipoll). We tested whether the affinities differed among insect orders and according to insect frequency (frequent or infrequent). Our results indicate that the affinities with the three land-use types differed among insect orders. Apart from Hymenopterans, which appeared tolerant to the different land-uses, all flower visitors presented a negative affinity with urban areas and a positive affinity with agricultural and natural areas. Additionally, infrequent taxa displayed a lower affinity with urban areas and a higher affinity with natural areas than did frequent taxa. Within frequent taxa, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera included specialists of the three land-use types whereas Diptera and Lepidoptera contained specialists of all but urban areas. Conclusions/Significance: Our approach allowed the first standardised evaluation of the affinity of flower visitors with the main land-use types across a broad taxonomical range and a wide geographic scope. Our results suggest that the most detrimental land-use change for flower visitor communities is urbanisation. Moreover, our findings highlight the fact that agricultural areas have the potential to host highly diverse pollinator communities. We suggest that policy makers should, therefore, focus on the implementation of pollinator-friendly practices in agricultural lands. This may be a win-win strategy, as both biodiversity and crop production may benefit from healthier communities of flower visitors in these areas. © 2012 Deguines et al.","2012","2022-11-02 15:44:45","2022-11-02T15:44:45Z",NA,"","","9",7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The environmental impact quotient (EIQ) is a pesticide risk indicator that was used to rank the inherent risk of 48 insecticides in use in 28 Iranian provinces and evaluate their environmental impact (EI) at the field and provincial scales over three growing seasons from 2001 to 2005. The results indicate that the introduction of new insecticides over the past decades has produced a negligible decrease in inherent risk. About 75% of provinces had low EI scores of 0.62-11.3. The highest EI and EI/ha scores were found in Kerman and Mazandaran provinces, mainly from increased usage (amount of active ingredient) rather than increased toxicity of insecticides. Inherent toxicity (EIQ) was not significant for increased EI in contrast to the increase in pesticide usage. On average, diazinon comprised 37% of total usage, carbaryl 12.2% and teflubenzuron 8% of total usage. The toxicity of these insecticides ranked lower for EIQ. In contrast, the total usage of environmentally high-risk insecticides (imidacloprid, fipronil, lindane) was relatively lower during the study period. Overall, the increased use of insecticides was not related to the increase in the area under cultivation, but to the type of crop grown (pistachios, vegetables) and to inappropriate spraying equipment and inadequate storage practices, both of which are common problems in developing countries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:45","2022-11-02T15:44:45Z",NA,"29–36","","",65,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Environmental impact; Indicator; Pesticide; Risk assessment","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fastest adoption rates have been experienced in South America where some countries are using no-tillage farming on about 70% of the total cultivated area. Opposite to countries like the USA where often fields under no-tillage farming are tilled every now and then, more than two thirds of the area under no-tillage systems in South America is permanently not tilled; in other words once adopted, the soil is never tilled again. The spread of no-tillage systems on more than 110 million ha world-wide shows the great adaptability of the systems to all kinds of climates, soils and cropping conditions. No-tillage is now being practiced from the artic circle over the tropics to about 50ºlatitude south, from sea level to 3,000 m altitude, from extremely rainy areas with 2,500 mm a year to extremely dry conditions with 250 mm a year. No-till farming offers a way of optimizing productivity and ecosystem services, offering a wide range of economic, environmental and social benefits to the producer and to the society. At the same time, no-till farming is enabling agriculture to respond to some of the global challenges associated with climate change, land and environmental degradation, and increasing cost of food, energy and production inputs. The wide recognition of no-till farming as a truly sustainable system should ensure the spread of the no-till technology and the associated practices of organic soil cover and crop rotation, as soon as the barriers to its adoption have been overcome, to areas where adoption is currently still low. The widespread adoption globally also shows that no-tillage farming cannot any more be considered a temporary fashion or a craze; instead largely through farmers'own effort, the system has established itself as a farming practice and a different way of thinking about sustainable agro-ecosystem management that can no longer be ignored by scientists, academics, extension workers, farmers at large as well as equipment and machine manufacturers and politicians.","2010","2022-11-02 15:44:44","2022-11-02T15:44:44Z",NA,"1–25","","1",3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Climate change; Conservation agriculture; Ecosystem services; Soil health; World-wide no-till adoption; Zero tillage adoption","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such plant-mediated indirect effects often involve herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that can be used as cues for foraging herbivores and their natural enemies, and are also known to affect pollinator attraction. In tightly co-evolved systems, the different trophic levels are expected to display adaptive response to changes in HIPVs caused by native herbivores. But what if a new herbivore invades such a system? Current literature suggests that exotic herbivores have the potential to affect HIPV production, and that plant responses to novel herbivores are likely to depend on phylogenetic relatedness between the invader and the native species. Here we review the different ways exotic herbivores can disrupt chemically mediated interactions between plants and the key users of HIPVs: herbivores, pollinators, and members of the third (i.e. predators and parasitoids) and fourth (i.e. hyperparasitoids) trophic levels. Current theory on insect invasions needs to consider that disruptive effects of invaders on infochemical networks can have a short-term impact on the population dynamics of native insects and plants, as well as exerting potentially negative consequences for the functioning of native ecosystems. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:43","2022-11-02T15:44:43Z",NA,"1854–1865","","8",37,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Invasive species; Multitrophic interactions; Plant volatiles; Plant-insect interactions","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"Q8QXY89N","report",1998,"Di Gregorio, a; Jansen, L J M","Land Cover Classification System (LCCS): Classification Concepts and User Manual","","","","","http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x0596e/x0596e00.htm","The Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) is a comprehensive, standardized a priori classification system, designed to meet specific user requirements, and created for mapping exercises, independent of the scale or means used to map. Any land cover identified anywhere in the world can be readily accommodated. The classification uses a set of independent diagnostic criteria that allow correlation with existing classifications and legends. Land cover classes are defined by a combination of a set of independent diagnostic criteria - the so-called classifiers - that are hierarchically arranged to assure a high degree of geographical accuracy. Because of the heterogeneity of land cover, the same set of classifiers cannot be used to define all land cover types. The hierarchical structure of the classifiers may differ from one land cover type to another. Therefore, the classification has two main phases: an initial Dichotomous Phase, where eight major land cover types are distinguished; and a subsequent Modular-Hierarchical Phase where the set of classifiers and their hierarchical arrangement are tailored to the major land cover type. This approach allows the use of the most appropriate classifiers and reduces the total number of impractical combinations of classifiers. Because of the complexity of the classification and the need for standardization, a software application has been developed to assist the interpretation process. This will reduce heterogeneity between interpreters and between interpretations over time. Because of the flexible manner in which the classification is set up, with creation of classes at different levels of the system and the optional use of modifiers, environmental attributes and specific technical attributes in combination, coupled with the tremendous number of classes possible, this innovative software application assists the user to select the appropriate class using a step-by-step process, i.e., classifier by classifier. The software application will be available both as a stand-alone product and integrated into a digital image interpretation software suite which will allow interpretation of imagery followed by labelling of the mapping units with the land cover classes, the Africover Interpretation and Mapping System (AIMS). The classification system leads to mutually exclusive land cover classes, which comprise: (1) a unique Boolean formula (a coded string of classifiers used); (2) a standard name; and (3) a unique numerical code. Both the numerical code and standard name can be used to build an automatically generated Legend, with the classes created grouped according to the main land cover categories and their domains according to the level of detail. The nomenclature can be linked to a user-defined name in any language. Further definition of the Land Cover Class can be achieved by adding attributes. Two types of attributes, which form separate levels in the classification, are distinguished: Environmental Attributes: these are attributes (e.g., climate, landform, altitude, soil, lithology and erosion) which influence land cover but are not inherent features of it and should not be mixed with ""pure"" land cover classifiers; and Specific Technical Attributes: these are associated with specific technical disciplines (e.g., for (Semi-)Natural Vegetation, the Floristic Aspect can be added; for Cultivated Areas, the Crop Type; and for Bare Soil, the Soil Type). All Primarily Vegetated land cover classes are derived from a consistent physiognomic-structural conceptual approach that combines the classifiers Life Form, Cover and Height (in (Semi)Natural Vegetation) and Life Form (in Cultivated Areas) with Spatial Distribution. The Primarily Non-Vegetated classes have a similar approach, using classifiers that deal with surface aspects, distribution/density and height/depth. The advantages of the classifier, or parametric, approach are manifold. The system created is a highly flexible a priori land cover classification in which each land cover class is clearly and systematically defined, thus providing internal consistency. The system is truly hierarchical and applicable at a variety of scales. Re-arrangement of the classes based on re-grouping of the classifiers used facilitates extensive use of the outputs by a wide variety of end-users. Accuracy assessment of the end product can be generated by class or by the individual classifiers forming the class. All land covers can be accommodated in this highly flexible system; the classification could therefore serve as a universally applicable reference base for land cover, thus contributing towards data harmonization and standardization.","1998","2022-11-02 15:44:41","2022-11-02T15:44:41Z",NA,"157","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Canopy observations indicated that African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) were the predominant floral visitors in fragmented habitats and replaced native insects in isolated pasture trees. Trees in habitat fragments produced, on average, over three times as many seeds as trees in continuous forest, and microsatellite assays of seed arrays showed that genetic diversity was maintained across habitats. A paternity analysis further revealed gene flow over as much as 3.2 km of pasture, the most distant pollination precisely recorded for any plant species.

Subsidizing energy crops, for example, recently fostered a strong increase in the area cultivated with oilseed rape Brassica napus across the EU. These changes in landscape structure affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Mass-flowering oilseed rape has been shown to positively affect colony growth and densities of bumblebees, which may enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Not considered, however, have been species-specific traits of pollinators resulting in disproportionate benefits from these recurrent resource pulses. A subsequent community shift towards the subsidized species potentially distorts plant-pollinator interactions in the surrounding landscape. We analysed the effects of mass-flowering crops on the abundance of legitimate long-tongued bumblebee pollinators, nectar robbing by illegitimate short-tongued bumblebees and seed set in the long-tubed flowers of red clover Trifolium pratense in 12 landscape sectors with differing amounts of oilseed rape. Densities of long-tongued bumblebees visiting long-tubed plants decreased with increasing amounts of oilseed rape. The simultaneous increase of nectar robbing suggests that resource depletion is a likely explanation for this decline which may lead to a distortion in plant-pollinator interactions. The decline in long-tongued bumblebees, however, did not result in an immediate effect on seed set. In contrast, seed set increased with increasing amounts of semi-natural habitats, indicating the positive effects of these habitats on the legitimate long-tongued pollinators. Synthesis and applications. Accounting for species-specific traits is essential in evaluating the ecological impacts of land-use change. The disproportional trait-specific benefits of increasing oilseed rape to short-tongued bumblebees may abet an increasingly pollinator-dependent agriculture but simultaneously threaten the more specialized and rare long-tongued species and their functions. Semi-natural habitats were found to positively affect seed set in long-tubed plants indicating that they can counteract the potentially distorting effects of transient mass-flowering crops on plant-pollinator interactions in agroecosystems. Future agri-environmental schemes should aim to provide diverse and continuous resources matching trait-specific requirements of various pollinators in order to avoid resource competition. Thereby they harmonize the economic interest in abundant pollinators and the conservation interest in protecting rare species. © 2009 The Authors.

Regarding oilseed rape, the most common biofuel crop in the EU, positive responses of flower-visiting insects to plentiful nectar and pollen seem apparent. However, previous investigations on this insect guild revealed conflicting results, potentially because they focused on different taxonomic groups representing a narrow range of ecological traits and considered only short time periods. Here, using trap nests in landscapes with independent gradients in area of oilseed rape and seminatural habitats, we assessed the whole community of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, including early- and late-emerging species. Our study's temporal resolution allowed determination of flowering and postflowering effects of oilseed rape on these species' richness, abundance, and mortality. Species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps significantly increased with oilseed rape, although nesting activity was considerably higher after mass flowering. In addition to increasing richness independently of oilseed rape, the amount of seminatural habitat in the landscape was the sole positive driver of insect abundance once the community's dominant species was accounted for as a covariate. Thus, growth of the co-occurring species' community is not stimulated by the resource pulse provided by oilseed rape early in the year, but by persistent resources provided by seminatural habitats after mass flowering. Early individuals of bivoltine species' first generations accumulated in seminatural habitats when these habitats were scarce, but became increasingly diluted when habitat availability increased. Once established, later foraging females generally benefited from the resource availability of seminatural habitats when initializing the second generation. We conclude that mass-flowering crops, despite covering only a short interval of the community's main activity phase, benefit bee and wasp species richness. However, seminatural habitats are crucial in maintaining viable communities of flower-visiting insects at the landscape scale, mitigating potential negative effects of high land-use intensities in modern agro-ecosystems. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:39","2022-11-02T15:44:39Z",NA,"219–226","","3",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agricultural landscapes; Bioenergy; Biofuel; Canola; Ecosystem service; Environmental change; Functional traits; Oilseed rape; Pollination; Resource pulse","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Flowering invasive plant species that are visited by native insects and overlap with native plant species in their pollinators may facilitate or disrupt native flower visitation and fertilisation by forming large, dense populations with high numbers of flowers and copious rewards. We investigated the direction of such a proposed effect for the alien invasive Rhododendron ponticum in Irish habitats. Flower visitation, conspecific and alien pollen deposition, fruit and seed set were measured in a self-compatible native focal plant, Digitalis purpurea, and compared between field sites that contained different relative abundances of R. ponticum. Flower visitation was significantly lower at higher alien relative plant abundances than at lower abundances or in the absence of the alien. Native flowers experienced a significant decrease in conspecific pollen deposition with increasing alien abundance. Heterospecific pollen transfer was very low in all field sites but increased significantly with increasing relative R. ponticum abundance. However, lower flower visitation and lower conspecific pollen transfer did not alter reproductive success of D. purpurea. Our study shows that indirect interactions between alien and native plants for pollination can be modified by population characteristics (such as relative abundance) in a similar way as interactions among native plant species. In D. purpurea, only certain aspects of pollination and reproduction were affected by high alien abundances which is probably a result of high resilience due to a self-compatible breeding system. Native species that are more susceptible to pollen limitation are more likely to experience fitness disadvantages in habitats with high relative alien plant abundances.","2011","2022-11-02 15:44:38","2022-11-02T15:44:38Z",NA,"469–479","","2",167,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To test this hypothesis, we examined the visitation frequency and behavior of native and alien bumble bee species and resultant seed production in Corydalis ambigua, a native plant in Hokkaido, Japan. This species is self-incompatible: the flower has a spur and requires visitation by bumble bees for effective seed production. We compared visitation frequency as well as fruit and seed set after cross- and open pollination at five sites of C. ambigua. Four of these sites occurred near a residential district and included naturalized populations of B. terrestris, and the fifth site was located in a forested habitat with no B. terrestris. The native species B. arclens and B. hypocrita and the alien B. terrestris frequently visited C. ambigua. Bombus ardens legitimately consumed nectar, whereas B. hypocrita and B. terrestris rob nectar by perforating spurs. The legitimate pollinator B. ardens produced fruits and seeds more efficiently than the nectar robbers. At three sites, the proportion of robbed flowers per inflorescence gradually increased through the flowering period, which may be caused by the intrusion of alien B. terrestris into the native plant-pollinator interactions. At these sites, C. ambigua suffered from pollen limitation, as seed production from open pollination was lower than from cross-pollination, despite the fact that the total abundance of three bumble bees was higher than in the other two sites. Legitimate B. ardens visited fewer flowers within inflorescences with more robbed flowers, suggesting that nectar robbing may reduce the frequency of visitations by B. ardens within inflorescences, and resulting in decreased fruit set. Furthermore, reduced seed set implies a reduction in the pollination quality by B. ardens, probably due to decreases in visiting time per flower. Thus, introduction of alien B. terrestris may alter the native plant-pollinator mutualism: C. ambigua could establish a novel pollination relationship with B. terrestris because of its nonzero pollination efficiency, similar to the native robber B. hypocrita.

Here we review studies on alien bee pollinators, demonstrating the ways in which invasive honeybees and bumblebees affect native plant seed production. Impacts of alien pollinators vary among pollination systems and among components of pollination success (visitation frequency, pollen transfer per visit, and pollen limitation). Reproduction of native bird-pollinated plants is little impacted by alien honeybees, because birds can pollinate even when honeybees visit target flowers. In bee-pollinated native plants, alien honeybee impacts on reproduction may be pervasive, but are not clearly defined in many cases; this lack of clarity arises because very few control sites without invasive bees are available, making comparative evaluation impossible. In bumblebee-pollinated plants, alien bumblebee effects are strong because native and invasive bee species are closely related congeners (of the genus Bombus) with similar pollinator mechanisms; alien bumblebees compete strongly with natives or replace them. In general, morphological, ecological, and behavioral similarities between native and alien pollinators are important for predicting their competitive interaction intensities and their effects on plant reproduction. The impacts of alien bees include (1) decreased pollen transfer per visit because of the loose morphological correspondence between flowers and alien bees, (2) increased competition for floral resources and exclusion of native pollinators because native and alien bees have similar ecological requirements, (3) changes in native pollinator visitation frequency and pollination efficiency caused by particular alien pollinator behavioral traits (such as stealing nectar or collecting previously-deposited pollen from stigmas). For a quantitative evaluation of invasion impacts, it is important to determine whether native plants suffer pollen limitation. To demonstrate pollen limitation, comparative studies with controls (that lack alien pollinators) are required. This approach is essential for discerning possible mechanisms responsible for observed patterns.","2010","2022-11-02 15:44:35","2022-11-02T15:44:35Z",NA,"37–47","","1",45,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pollinator nutrition is dependent on floral resources (i.e., nectar and pollen), which are linked to landscape composition. Here, we present a stratified analysis of the nutritional composition of beebread in managed honeybee hives with a view to examining potential sources of variation in its nutritional composition. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that beebread composition correlates with local land use and therefore available floral resources. The results demonstrated that the starch, lipid, and moisture contents of beebread are all highly conserved across hives, whereas levels of protein and nonreducing sugar increased as the year progressed, reducing sugars, however, decreased during the first half of the year and then increased toward the end. Local land use around hives was quantified using data from the Countryside Survey 2007 Land Cover Map. Bee-bread protein content was negatively correlated with increasing levels of arable and horticultural farmland surrounding hives and positively correlated with the cover of natural grasslands and broadleaf woodlands. Reducing sugar content was also positively correlated with the amount of broad-leaved woodland in a 3 Km² radius from the hives. Previous studies on a range of invertebrates, including honeybees, indicate that dietary protein intake may have a major impact on correlates of fitness, including longevity and immune function. The finding that beebread protein content correlates with land use suggests that landscape composition may impact on insect pollinator well-being and provides a link between landscape and the nutritional ecology of socially foraging insects in a way not previously considered.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:34","2022-11-02T15:44:34Z",NA,"4195–4206","","21",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apis mellifera; Beebread; Carbohydrate; Countryside Survey; Land use; Nutritional ecology; Protein","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ratio of queen weight/size was lower in the colonies near honeybees in 1 year, while males were smaller and offspring sex ratio more male biased in colonies close to honeybees than in those far from honeybees.

Controversy exists over the global dependence on such agents, given their excessive use/misuse, their volatility, long-distance transport and eventual environmental contamination in colder climates. Many developing countries are in transitional phases with migration of the agricultural workforce to urban centres in search of better-paying jobs, leaving fewer people responsible for raising traditional foods for themselves and for the new, industrialized workforce. Capable of growing two or three crops per year, these same countries are becoming 'breadbaskets' for the world, exporting nontraditional agricultural produce to regions having colder climates and shorter growing seasons, thereby earning much needed international trade credits. To attain these goals, there has been increased reliance on chemical pesticides. Many older, nonpatented, more toxic, environmentally persistent and inexpensive chemicals are used extensively in developing nations, creating serious acute health problems and local and global environmental contamination. There is growing public concern in these countries that no one is aware of the extent of pesticide residue contamination on local, fresh produce purchased daily or of potential, long-term, adverse health effects on consumers. Few developing nations have a clearly expressed 'philosophy' concerning pesticides. There is a lack of rigorous legislation and regulations to control pesticides as well as training programs for personnel to inspect and monitor use and to initiate training programs for pesticide consumers. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.","2001","2022-11-02 15:44:27","2022-11-02T15:44:27Z",NA,"27–33","","1-3",160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 11246121",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"5TP5BCFQ","manuscript",2014,"USEPA/HCPMRA/CDPR","Guidance for Assessing Pesticide Risks to Bees","","","","","http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-","This document provides guidance to risk assessors for evaluating the potential risk of pesticides to bees, particularly honey bees (Apis mellifera). This guidance is not limited to identifying the risk assessment process but includes consideration of the underlying data on which the process is based. For purposes of brevity, this guidance refers to the White Paper in Support of the Proposed Risk Assessment Process for Bees submitted to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) for review and comment in September 2012. The White Paper describes the basic framework of the risk assessment process and the data used to inform the various tiers of refinement that may be required to support risk management decisions. This guidance also considers recommendations provided by the FIFRA SAP in response to the White Paper, where such recommendations can be immediately implemented. Additional recommendations from the FIFRA SAP that cannot be implemented at this time, because the science supporting such efforts has not been sufficiently vetted, will be considered as the science evolves. The risk assessment process described in the White Paper identifies a tiered approach where data are collected on individual bees that are representative of different life stages (larval/pupal versus adults) and castes (e.g., worker bees). While additional data may be available on other bee species and these data can be included in the tiered risk assessment process as an additional line of evidence, the primary process relies on honey bee data as a surrogate for both Apis and non-Apis bees. In this process, laboratory-based studies of larval/pupal and adult honey bees provide data on individual bees that can be used as a surrogate for other species of bees, including solitary species. At the semi-field and full-field levels, studies of the colony can be used to represent effects to honey bees themselves and as a surrogate for other social bees. An advantage of using honey bees is that the husbandry and life cycle of the species and its significance in pollination services is well known and test protocols are available. As the science evolves, methods and studies using non-Apis bees may be considered and incorporated into the risk assessment. The risk assessment process for bees is consistent with that used for other taxa, as described in the Overview Document, in that it consists of three phases (i.e., problem formulation, analysis, and risk characterization) and it is tiered. The first tier consists of a screening-level risk assessment that is intended to be sufficiently conservative such that chemicals that pass the screen are considered to represent a relatively low risk of adverse effects to bees. For those chemicals which do not pass the initial screen, refinements in exposure estimates and/or mitigation measures may sufficiently reduce risk quotients (RQs) below levels of concern (LOCs) such that further refinements are not needed. For chemicals where RQ values still exceed LOCs and, depending on risk management needs, additional refinements in exposure and/or effects estimates can be made based on studies with increasing levels of environmental realism. Although approaches for estimating exposure and effects differ across aquatic and terrestrial systems as well as between plants and animals, the basic process of moving from a screening-level assessment with conservative assumptions to more refined measures of exposure and effects is consistent across taxa. The guidance follows the generic structure of the risk assessment process, as described in the White Paper and Overview Document. While this guidance is not intended to be exhaustive, it provides staff with sufficient information with which to ensure consistency in ecological risk assessments written in support of new and existing pesticide registration decisions. The different levels of refinement described in the guidance are not intended to be prescriptive; the specific set of data used in assessing potential risks of a pesticide to bees ultimately depends on multiple lines of evidence and risk management objectives.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:25","2022-11-02T15:44:25Z",NA,"","59","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this review, we briefly introduce the many pathogens and parasites afflicting honey bees, highlighting the biology of specific taxonomic groups mainly as they relate to virulence and possible defenses. Second, we describe physiological, immunological, and behavioral responses of individual bees toward pathogens and parasites. Third, bees also show behavioral mechanisms for reducing the disease risk of their nestmates. Accordingly, we discuss the dynamics of hygienic behavior and other group-level behaviors that can limit disease. Finally, we conclude with several avenues of research that seem especially promising for understanding host-parasite relationships in bees and for developing breeding or management strategies for enhancing honey bee health. We discuss how human efforts to maintain healthy colonies intersect with similar efforts by the bees, and how bee management and breeding protocols can affect disease traits in the short and long term.","2010","2022-11-02 15:44:24","2022-11-02T15:44:24Z",NA,"S62–S72","","SUPPL. 1",103,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Chalkbrood; Colony collapse disorder; Dicistroviridae; Foulbrood; Hygienic behavior; Innate immunity; Pollinator; Social immunity; Varroa mites","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of 'functional landscape heterogeneity'. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.","2011-02","2022-11-02 15:44:22","2022-11-02T15:44:22Z",NA,"101–112","","2",14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21087380",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agri-environment scheme; Crop diversity; Field margins; Field size; Habitat fragmentation; Intermediate heterogeneity hypothesis; Landscape complementation; Landscape composition; Landscape configuration; Spatial heterogeneity","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Plant. Sci. 70: t27-137. To determine the effects of varying plant densities on summer rape (Brassica napus L.), the cultivar Westar was seeded in 15-and 30-cm row spacings at seeding rates of 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0 kg ha-r. Plants seeded in 15-cm rows yielded more per area, produced more pods per plant and lodged less than those in 30-cm rows. Higher yields were associated with a more even plant distribution and a lower degree of intra-row competition. There were no significant protein, oil and chlorophyll conce!tration differences between the row spacing treatments. The highest yields (kg ha ') were achieved with the 1.5 and 3.0 kg ha 'seeding rates. Summer rape compensated for lower plant densities with the production of more branch racemes. As seeding rate increased, competitive mortality increased, resulting in greater etiolation at bolting, and greater lodging at harvest. Seed oil and protein concentrations were not affected by seeding rate. However, seed chlorophyll concentration decreased with increased seeding rate.

We measured the temperature responses of floral emissions of various common species of Mediterranean plants using dynamic headspace sampling and used GC-MS to identify and quantify the emitted terpenes. Floral emissions increased with temperature to an optimum and thereafter decreased. The responses to temperature modeled here predicted increases in the rates of floral terpene emission of 0.03-1.4-fold, depending on the species, in response to an increase of 1 °C in the mean global ambient temperature. Under the warmest projections that predict a maximum increase of 5 °C in the mean temperature of Mediterranean climates in the Northern Hemisphere by the end of the century, our models predicted increases in the rates of floral terpene emissions of 0.34-9.1-fold, depending on the species. The species with the lowest emission rates had the highest relative increases in floral terpene emissions with temperature increases of 1-5 °C. The response of floral emissions to temperature differed among species and among different compounds within the species. Warming not only increased the rates of total emissions, but also changed the ratios among compounds that constituted the floral scents, i.e. increased the signal for pollinators, but also importantly altered the signal fidelity and probability of identification by pollinators, especially for specialists with a strong reliance on species-specific floral blends.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:19","2022-11-02T15:44:19Z",NA,"3660–3669","","12",20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Chemical communication; Emission profiles; Flower physiology; Flower volatile emissions; Global warming; Monoterpenes; Physicochemical properties; Sesquiterpenes; Temperature-response curve; Volatility","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, there is a concerning global trend of pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected.Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex field conditions. To help safeguard pollinator health, whole life-cycle fitness assessments, particularly for non-Apis bees, stringently incorporating chronic and sublethal side effects of pesticides, as well as interactions with common natural stressors, such as prevalent parasites, should be considered in the corresponding test guidelines.

Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40 % of trips vs 63 % trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 % less pollen per hour than controls. This study demonstrates that field-realistic doses of these pesticides substantially impacts on foraging ability of bumblebee workers when collecting pollen, and we suggest that this provides a causal mechanism behind reduced queen production in imidacloprid exposed colonies.","2014","2022-11-02 15:44:17","2022-11-02T15:44:17Z",NA,"317–323","","3",23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bombus; Neonicotinoid; Pollen collection; RFID technology","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pollinators, specifically bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages. We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675 individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95% were native, 50% were solitary, and 93% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of specimens, eusocial (50% of specimens), native (97%), and polylectic (98%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and 19% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species (6% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host relatively diverse and intact bee communities.","2008","2022-11-02 15:44:16","2022-11-02T15:44:16Z",NA,"1067–1077","","6",101,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The chapter illustrates the proposed risk assessment process identified by the participants of the 2011 SETAC Workshop on Pesticide Risk Assessment for Pollinators. The potential risk to adult honey bees from spray applications is assessed through calculation of an HQ.

Populations of the iconic monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) of eastern North America have declined over the last 21 years. Three hypotheses have been posed to explain the decline: habitat loss on the overwintering grounds in Mexico, habitat loss on the breeding grounds in the United States and Canada, and extreme weather events. Our objectives were to assess population viability, determine which life-stage, season and geographic region are contributing the most to population dynamics and test the three hypotheses that explain the observed population decline. We developed a spatially-structured, stochastic and density-dependent periodic projection matrix model that integrates patterns of migratory connectivity and demographic vital rates across the annual cycle. We used perturbation analysis to determine the sensitivity of population abundance to changes in vital rate among life-stages, seasons, and geographic regions. Next, we compared the singular effects of each threat to the full model where all factors operate concurrently. Finally, we generated predictions to assess the risk of host plant loss as a result of genetically modified crops on current and future monarch butterfly population size and extinction probability. Our year-round population model predicted population declines of 14% and a quasi-extinction probability (\textless1000 individuals) greater than 5% within a century. Monarch abundance was more than four times more sensitive to perturbations of vital rates on the breeding grounds than on the wintering grounds. Simulations that considered only forest loss or climate change in Mexico predicted higher population sizes compared to milkweed declines on the breeding grounds. Our model predictions also suggest that mitigating the negative effects of genetically modified crops results in higher population size and lower extinction risk. Recent population declines stem from reduction in milkweed host plants in the United States that arise from increasing adoption of genetically modified crops and land-use change, not from climate change or degradation of forest habitats in Mexico. Therefore, reducing the negative effects of host plant loss on the breeding grounds is the top conservation priority to slow or halt future population declines of monarch butterflies in North America.

Here we present 35 years of data on 159 species of butterflies from 10 sites along an elevational gradient spanning 0-2,775 m in a biodiversity hotspot, the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Northern California. Species richness has declined at half of the sites, with the most severe reductions at the lowest elevations, where habitat destruction is greatest. At higher elevations, we observed clear upward shifts in the elevational ranges of species, consistent with the influence of global warming. Taken together, these long-term data reveal the interacting negative effects of human-induced changes on both the climate and habitat available to butterfly species in California. Furthermore, the decline of ruderal, disturbance-associated species indicates that the traditional focus of conservation efforts on more specialized and less dispersive species should be broadened to include entire faunas when estimating and predicting the effects of pervasive stressors.","2010","2022-11-02 15:44:13","2022-11-02T15:44:13Z",NA,"2088–2092","","5",107,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To understand how plant communities respond to diversity changes in their pollinating fauna, we manipulated the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators under natural conditions. Increasing the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators led to the recruitment of more diverse plant communities. After two years the plant communities pollinated by the most functionally diverse pollinator assemblage contained about 50% more plant species than did plant communities pollinated by less-diverse pollinator assemblages. Moreover, the positive effect of functional diversity was explained by a complementarity between functional groups of pollinators and plants.

Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species losses will often result in loss of trait diversity, with likely consequences for community functioning. However, the converse need not be generally true: management approaches that succeed in retaining species richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We evaluated this possibility using bee communities in a California agroecosystem. We examined among site patterns in bee species diversity and functional-trait diversity in a landscape composed of a mosaic of semi-natural habitat, organic farms and conventional farms. We sampled bees from all three habitat types and compiled a data base of life-history ('functional') traits for each species. Although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms, functional diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat. Nesting location (below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary trait contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability of nesting substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including phenology and sociality, were also associated with species' occurrences or dominance in particular site types. These patterns suggest that management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee communities. Synthesis and applications. Although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice. Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural habitat elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems.

In New York, it now occurs primarily on managed, early-successional sites such as power line corridors (utility rights-of-way) from Albany to Glens Falls. Blue lupine (Lupinus perennis), the exclusive larval food source of the KBB, has been suggested to be the most limiting factor for the butterfly within the eastern portion of its range. Power line corridor management maintains early-successional habitats by suppressing the regrowth of woody species, creating potentially important habitat for the conservation and restoration of the KBB complex. This research compared the effects of several vegetation-clearing methods on Blue lupine populations and associated communities of nectar species for KBB over an 8-year period. Methods evaluated differed in intensity (annual, 4-, or 8-year intervals) and type (herbicide or mechanical). Blue lupine and plant community responses did not significantly differ among the treatment types applied to the power line corridors. However, Blue lupine cover, clump size, and density of stems per clump increased following the application of treatments in general. The number and cover of nectar species, total herbaceous cover, and species richness also responded positively to treatment overall. The percentage of nonnative species temporarily increased following treatment but declined to near pre-treatment levels again as woody cover increased. Temporal changes in plant community composition were not related to management methods. The management tools assessed, mowing and herbicide application, will accomplish the goal of halting or reversing succession, maintaining critical habitat for the KBB in a landscape that provides little other suitable habitat. © 2005 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","2005","2022-11-02 15:44:12","2022-11-02T15:44:12Z",NA,"488–498","","3",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Blue lupine; Karner blue butterfly; Lupin us perennis; Pine barrens; Power line corridor; Rights-of-way","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Predictable ecological patterns that emerge from these studies can provide guidance on how future urban constructs can be designed to provide habitat for conserving and protecting native bees. These patterns can also be used for bee habitat restoration in natural and agricultural environments. An extensive survey of native bees and honey bees and their relationships to a community of 102 plant types in urban residential environments of Bagaces and Liberia in northwestern Costa Rica was conducted from 2003-2012. Bees were attracted and recorded at measurable frequencies to 82 plant genera in 41 families, the most common of which was Fabaceae. Forty-two plant types were native ornamentals; 39 were non-natives; and 21 were native weed species. Standardized bee visitation (frequency) counts, 17,000+, were used to record relationships between bees and flowers. The following data were recorded for each plant type: flowering phenology in months, type of floral reward(s) (pollen, nectar, and/or oil), main daily attraction period, and most frequently visiting bee taxa. Plant life forms included trees, shrubs, lianas/vines, herbs, and palms. Each plant group had a different seasonal flowering phenology with native ornamentals and native weeds having patterns that closely resembled the general patterns for wild plants in the dry forest. Predictable associations of certain bee taxa with each plant type emerged from the count data, which allowed for categorizing relationships into four types: small bee, diverse bee, specialized bee, and nocturnal pollination systems. Intraspecific variations in bee attraction to several plant types were also noted. Honey bees (Africanized) did not figure prominently in most pollination relationships, especially with regard to native plants. Most native bee species were generalized foragers. Beyond the urban environment, it is suggested that knowledge of predictable bee-flower relationships can also be used to restore bee habitat in disturbed environments such as deforested areas. With some imagination and outreach education, bee habitats could also be installed for some agricultural crops.

Es wurde untersucht, ob das Mähen solcher Felder mit modernen Maschinen zu Bienenverlusten führen kann. Dazu wurden 2 Kunstwiesen mit Weissklee im Juli sowie ein Feld mit Phacelia im Juni bei regem Bienenflug mit einem Kreiselmäher mit integriertem Rotoraufbereiter gemäht. Dieser knickt und quetscht das Mähgut. Erfasst wurden die Bienen im Feld unmittelbar vor dem Mähen sowie die Anzahl und der Zustand der Bienen, welche im Mähgut zu finden waren. Die Differenz der beiden Werte ergab die Verluste als Folge des Mähens. In den 2 Weisskleefeldern befanden sich vor dem Mähen im Durchschnitt 1,7 bzw. 3,9 und im Phaceliafeld 26,0 Bienen pro m2. Davon wurden im Mähgut folgende Anteile wieder gefunden: Weissklee 53 % bzw. 62 % und bei Phacelia 35 %. Rund die Hälfte der im Mähgut wiedergefundenen Bienen war tot oder flugunfähig. Die andere Hälfte war flugfähig, trug aber mehrheitlich sichtbare Verletzungen. Ihre Chance, als Sammlerinnen weiter aktiv zu sein, ist eher als gering einzustufen. Hochgerechnet pro Hektare betrugen die Bienenverluste beim Weissklee rund 9'000 bis 25'000 Bienen und bei Phacelia 90'000. Wenn der Aufbereiter aus dem Mähwerk entfernt wurde, befanden sich 90 % weniger flugunfähige und tote Bienen im Weissklee-Mähgut. Zahlreiche Bienen wurden dabei beobachtet, wie sie vom Mähgut aufflogen und das Sammeln an den Weisskleeblüten fortsetzten. Für Landwirte werden Massnahmen empfohlen, um die Bienenverluste beim Mähen blühender Futterwiesen möglichst gering zu halten.

The parasite is cross-infective with the European honey bee, Apis mellifera. It is not known when or where N. ceranae first infected European bees, but N. ceranae has probably been infecting European bees for at least two decades. N. ceranae appears to be replacing Nosema apis, at least in some populations of European honey bees. This replacement is an enigma because the spores of the new parasite are less durable than those of N. apis. Virulence data at both the individual bee and at the colony level are conflicting possibly because the impact of this parasite differs in different environments. The recent advancements in N. ceranae genetics, with a draft assembly of the N. ceranae genome available, are discussed and the need for increased research on the impacts of this parasite on European honey bees is emphasized. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Merozoites are mostly formed by cytoplasmic fission in quadrinucleate meronts and the number of merogonial cycles may vary. The sporogony is disporoblastic. The living mature spore is ovocylindrical, straight to slightly curved and measures 4.7 x 2.7 μm whereas fixed and stained spores measure 3.6 x 1.7 μm. The polar filament is isofilar with a diameter of 96-102 nm and is arranged in 20-23 coils in the posterior and mid-part of the spore. In the anterior part of the polaroplast there are closely packed approximately 11 nm thick lamellae. The lamellae of the posterior polaroplast are thicker and less regular. In the posterior part of the mature spore a well fixed posterior body interpreted as a posterosome was often observed.

However, there is little consensus as to the optimum scale for management. This is particularly acute in the agricultural environment given the level of public investment in agri-environment schemes (AES). Using a novel multiscale hierarchical sampling design, we assess the effect of land use at multiple spatial scales (from location-within-field to regions) on farmland biodiversity. We show that on-farm biodiversity components depend on farming practices (organic vs. conventional) at farm and landscape scales, but this strongly interacts with fine- and coarse-scale variables. Different taxa respond to agricultural practice at different spatial scales and often at multiple spatial scales. Hence, AES need to target multiple spatial scales to maximize effectiveness. Novel policy levers may be needed to encourage multiple land managers within a landscape to adopt schemes that create landscape-level benefits.","2010-07","2022-11-02 15:44:02","2022-11-02T15:44:02Z",NA,"858–869","","7",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 20482572",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agri-environment schemes; Agro-ecology; Conservation; Diversity; Landscape; Spill-over","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This increase in population density makes them more susceptible to disease, and it also brings the natural diseases to our attention when we see them for the first time. Thus, when we domesticate bees, we need to pay attention to disease control. Most examples of bee disease control are known from honey bees because of our long history of managing this bee. Most modern attempts at honey bee disease control have centered on either the use of drug treatments or destroying entire colonies and all the associated hive equipment. However, it is clear that disease control strategies are more likely to be successful when the disease cycle within the managed system is understood and taken into account. As with the discovery and implementation of integrated pest management systems for pest control in crops, we are likely to obtain the most utilitarian disease control if we avoid thinking that the only means to control disease is to be sanitary and destroy infected colonies.

As a result of this disturbance, introduced honeybees are now the dominant visitors to flowers instead of endemic bees on these islands. On the other hand, satellite islands not invaded by alien anoles have retained the native flower visitors. The effects of pollinator change on plant reproduction were surveyed on these contrasting island groups. The total visitation rates and the number of interacting visitor groups on main islands were 63% and 30% lower than that on satellite islands, respectively. On the main islands, the honeybees preferred to visit alien flowers, whereas the dominant endemic bees on satellite islands tended to visit native flowers more frequently than alien flowers. These results suggest that alien anoles destroy the endemic pollination system and caused shift to alien mutualism. On the main islands, the natural fruit set of alien plants was significantly higher than that of native plants. In addition, the natural fruit set was positively correlated with the visitation rate of honeybees. Pollen limitation was observed in 53.3% of endemic species but only 16.7% of alienspecies. These data suggest that reproduction of alien plants was facilitated by the floral preference of introduced honeybees. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2011","2022-11-02 15:43:57","2022-11-02T15:43:57Z",NA,"957–967","","4",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Alien predator; Biological invasion; Introduced honeybee; Oceanic island; Visitation rate; Visitor diversity","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

BACKGROUND: Far red light is known to penetrate soil and delay seed germination. Thiamethoxam as a seed treatment has been observed to enhance seed germination. No previous work has explored the effect of thiamethoxam on the physiological response of buried maize seed when germinating in the presence of above-ground weeds. We hypothesised that the changes in red:far red reflected from above-ground weeds would be detected by maize seed phytochrome and delay seed germination by decreasing the level of GA and increasing ABA. We further hypothesised that thiamethoxam would overcome this delay in germination. RESULTS: Thiamethoxam enhanced seed germination in the presence of above-ground weeds by increasing GA signalling and downregulating DELLA protein and ABA signalling genes. An increase in amylase activity and a degradation of starch were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Far red reflected from the above-ground weeds was capable of penetrating below the soil surface and was detected by maize seed phytochrome. Thiamethoxam altered the effect of far red on seed germination by stimulating GA and inhibiting ABA synthesis. This is the first study to suggest that the mode of action of thiamethoxam involves both GA synthesis and ABA inhibition.","2015","2022-11-02 15:43:55","2022-11-02T15:43:55Z",NA,"1335–1345","","9",71,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Amylase; Corn; Far red light; GA; Mode of action; R:FR; Radicle root; Red light; Seed germination; Starch","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The main cause of the decline is believed to be habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification.

However, urban green areas can also provide suitable alternative habitats for wild bees.\textless/p\textgreater \textless/sec\textgreater\textlesssec\textgreater \textlesstitle\textgreaterMethodology/Principal Findings\textless/title\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterWe studied bumble bees in allotment gardens, i.e. intensively managed flower rich green areas, along a gradient of urbanization from the inner city of Stockholm towards more rural (periurban) areas. Keeping habitat quality similar along the urbanization gradient allowed us to separate the effect of landscape change (e.g. proportion impervious surface) from variation in habitat quality. Bumble bee diversity (after rarefaction to 25 individuals) decreased with increasing urbanization, from around eight species on sites in more rural areas to between five and six species in urban allotment gardens. Bumble bee abundance and species composition were most affected by qualities related to the management of the allotment areas, such as local flower abundance. The variability in bumble bee visits between allotment gardens was higher in an urban than in a periurban context, particularly among small and long-tongued bumble bee species.\textless/p\textgreater \textless/sec\textgreater\textlesssec\textgreater \textlesstitle\textgreaterConclusions/Significance\textless/title\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterOur results suggest that allotment gardens and other urban green areas can serve as important alternatives to natural habitats for many bumble bee species, but that the surrounding urban landscape influences how many species that will be present.

It is meaningful for conservation to predict a plant species' extinction risk. We found 25 studies in the literature assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation on either pollination or reproductive success of 46 plant species to answer the following questions: 1. Are pollination and reproductive success of self-incompatible species more likely to decline with habitat fragmentation than the pollination and reproductive success of self-compatible species? Although most of the species showed statistically significant negative effects, the pollination and reproduction of self-incompatible species were as likely to decline with fragmentation as those of self-compatible species. 2. Are pollination and reproductive success of specialist plants more affected than the pollination and reproduction of generalist plants? Comparisons of fragmentation-related changes in pollination and reproductive success between specialists and generalists do not support the hypothesis that specialization in pollination increases the risk of plant extinction. 3. Can self-incompatible species offset their expected higher vulnerability to fragmentation by being, on average, more pollination generalist than self-compatible species? In a larger data set on 260 species, we did not find significant differences in either the mean number or frequency distribution of numbers of flower-visiting species or orders between self-compatible and self-incompatible species. Our review suggests that no generalizations can be made on susceptibility to fragmentation based on compatibility system and pollination specialization.","2002","2022-11-02 15:43:51","2022-11-02T15:43:51Z",NA,"885–892","","6","13",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Breeding system; Habitat fragmentation; Reproduction; Self-compatible; Self-incompatible; Specialization","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Invasions by entomophilous invasive plants may profoundly alter the way interaction networks are compartmenta-lized. We analysed a comprehensive dataset of 40 paired plant–pollinator networks (invaded versus uninvaded) to test this hypothesis. We show that invasive plants have higher generalization levels with respect to their pollina-tors than natives. The consequences for network topology are that—rather than displacing native species from the network—plant invaders attracting pol-linators into invaded modules tend to play new important topological roles (i.e. network hubs, module hubs and connectors) and cause role shifts in native species, creating larger modules that are more connected among each other. While the number of true compartments was lower in invaded compared with uninvaded networks, the effect of invasion on modularity was contingent on the study system. Interestingly, the generalization level of the invasive plants partially explains this pattern, with more generalized invaders contributing to a lower modularity. Our findings indicate that the altered interaction structure of invaded networks makes them more robust against simulated random second-ary species extinctions, but more vulnerable when the typically highly connected invasive plants go extinct first. The consequences and pathways by which biological invasions alter the interaction structure of plant–pollinator communities highlighted in this study may have important dynamical and functional implications, for example, by influencing multi-species reciprocal selection regimes and coevolutionary processes.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:50","2022-11-02T15:43:50Z",NA,"773","","20140","281",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Subject Areas; ecology Keywords; exotic species; nestedness; pollination; robustness; specialization","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, we tested the current hypotheses describing honeybee losses as a multifactorial syndrome, by investigating integrative effects of an infectious organism and an insecticide on honeybee health. We demonstrated that the interaction between the microsporidia Nosema and a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) significantly weakened honeybees. In the short term, the combination of both agents caused the highest individual mortality rates and energetic stress. By quantifying the strength of immunity at both the individual and social levels, we showed that neither the haemocyte number nor the phenoloxidase activity of individuals was affected by the different treatments. However, the activity of glucose oxidase, enabling bees to sterilize colony and brood food, was significantly decreased only by the combination of both factors compared with control, Nosema or imidacloprid groups, suggesting a synergistic interaction and in the long term a higher susceptibility of the colony to pathogens. This provides the first evidences that interaction between an infectious organism and a chemical can also threaten pollinators, interactions that are widely used to eliminate insect pests in integrative pest management.","2010","2022-11-02 15:43:50","2022-11-02T15:43:50Z",NA,"774–782","","3","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bees are pollinators that provide a vital ecosystem service to crops and wild plants. We assessed plant community structure in the campus of Universidade de São Paulo in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, included in the neotropical Atlantic Forest biome, focusing on floristic composition, pollination syndromes, flowering phenology, and spatiotemporal distribution of floral resources for bees. Currently, the city is surrounded by sugar cane plantations. Once a month, from April 2011 to March 2012, we sampled plant species and individuals in bloom in an area with 500. m radius from the bee-rearing facilities of Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras de Ribeirão Preto (FFCLRP), totaling 78 hectares. We sampled 289 plant species of 73 families; Leguminosae was the richest family. Plants pollinated by bees predominated (67%), followed by plants pollinated by hummingbirds (18%). Melittophilous species flowered throughout the year and, hence, food availability for bees was continuous. The flowering of plant individuals that provided pollen, nectar, and floral oil was seasonal in all vegetation (except for nectar in shrubs), with peaks in resource availability in the transition from the dry to the rainy season, and also in the rainy season.

Today, climate change is among the most serious threats to global biodiversity. Although many studies have revealed phenological responses to climate change, no long-term community-level indices have been developed. We derived a 250-year index of first flowering dates for 405 plant species in the UK for assessing the impact of climate change on plant communities. The estimated community-level index in the most recent 25 years was 2.2-12.7 days earlier than any other consecutive 25-year period since 1760. The index was closely correlated with February-April mean Central England Temperature, with flowering 5.0 days earlier for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature. The index was relatively sensitive to the number of species, not records per species, included in the model. Our results demonstrate how multi-species, multiple-site phenological events can be integrated to obtain indices showing trends for each species and across species. This index should play an important role in monitoring the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to incorporate data from other taxa and countries for evaluating cross-taxa and cross-country phenological responses to climate change.","2010","2022-11-02 15:43:47","2022-11-02T15:43:47Z",NA,"2451–2457","","1693","277",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; First flowering; Global warming; Hierarchical model; Indicator; Phenology","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although a large number of colonies of honeybees, Apis mellifera, and bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, are used for pollination, farmers face difficulty because of the absolute shortage of pollinators. Consequently, many of them are obliged to perform artificial pollination or apply hormones to their crops. To respond to these situations, the author has been trying to introduce the use of new efficient pollinators in recent years. Stingless bees, Meliponinae, and honeybees, Apinae, are the only highly social bees living in permanent colonies, and both share many biological characteristics. Many advantages could be expected from the use of stingless bees as pollinators. They are harmless to beekeepers and farmers, are active throughout the year, visit a wide range of crops (polylecty), and do not pose any environmental risks by escaping into natural habits because they cannot tolerate cold weather, especially in the winter. Consequently, among the stingless bees kept in their indigenous habitats, some promising species have been chosen and introduced from tropical and subtropical habitats overseas. These are Meripona beecheii, M. quadrifasciata, Trigona carbonaria, Tetragonula fuscobalteata, Scaptotorigona bipunctata, and Tetragonisca angustula.

"A4V2IT73","manuscript",2014,"Andersons","The Effect of the Loss of Plant Protection Products on UK Agriculture and Horticulture and the Wider Economy","","","","","7","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Plant Protection Products (PPP) are subject to rigorous testing and safety assessments. But, the regulatory environment has become increasingly challenging to established PPPs and product innovation.  Three main policies threaten the availability of PPP;  the approval process at EU level  the implementation of the Water Framework Directive at national level  restrictions on neonicotinoid seed treatments.  At present, no definitive list of PPP under threat from the various policies exists, in part due to uncertainty in the way regulations will be defined and interpreted. This project identified that 87 of the 250 active substances currently approved in the UK could be threatened by the cumulative effects of these policies.  In practice, there is a sliding scale of threat. It has been assessed that 40 active substances are highly likely to be lost or restricted. This includes 10 insecticides, 12 fungicides, 16 herbicides and 2 molluscicides. The active substances deemed likely to be withdrawn or restricted include important products for UK crop production.  Loss or restricted use would make control of weeds, disease, and pests in key UK crops far more difficult. Furthermore, as reliance is on fewer PPP, resistance build-up will become more likely.  Loss of PPP will result in lower overall yields. Predicted yield decreases range from 4-50% in the crops studied, based on the effect of losing PPP classified as ‘high' likelihood of being restricted or not gaining reauthorisation.  UK cropping patterns would change, with an increase in spring cropping, fallow and temporary grass. Overall food output from UK farming and horticulture would decline. Although it is assumed that the global market would offset the shortfall, the effect would be to make the UK more reliant on food imports and so reduce self-sufficiency.  Domestic production of some ‘iconic' British foods such as frozen peas, apples and fresh carrots would be severely curtailed.  The structural change in UK crop production would alter farming costs as seed, fertiliser and PPP uses all shift and greater reliance is placed on mechanical and hand weeding.  A reduction in home-grown cereal output would lead to rising livestock feed costs.  Modelling all the changes sees UK agriculture's Gross Value Added (GVA) fall by c. \pounds1.6bn per annum – a drop of 20% on the 5-year average (2009-2013).  UK farming profit (Total Income from Farming) drops by \pounds1.73bn in monetary terms, which equates to a 36% drop in overall profits. These figures are based on a realistic assessment of the risks of losses of PPP, not a worst-case scenario. The Andersons Centre CPA-NFU-AIC ii  Declining profitability will cause further structural change. In general, less efficient producers will exit the sector and farming operations will, on average, become fewer and larger.  The impact of losing key PPP goes wider than agriculture. Farming provides the raw materials for the wider agri-food sector which makes up over 7% of the total UK economy. As a result, the food processing and manufacturing sector would decline over time and potentially lose around \pounds2.5bn of GVA. The impact on the associated workforce would be job losses of 35,000 to 40,000.  The agricultural supply industry, including wholesalers would be hit hard with a loss of \pounds0.28bn in GVA and job losses of 3,500-4,000.  The UK's role as a major centre for PPP research and development is threatened by legislative uncertainty. This not only means that better and safer alternatives are not being developed, but it also threatens investment in this high-tech sector of the UK economy.  As the UK is a relatively wealthy country, purchased imports could make good any shortfall in domestic production. However, food costs are likely to rise for consumers. While not popular with most of the UK population, it would seriously affect up to a fifth of the population who already suffer food poverty.  There is a moral question of imposing rich-world production standards when some 842 million people globally do not have enough to eat. There is a strong argument that Europe, with its favourable soils and climate, should be optimising output (sustainable intensification).  Alternative production systems and technologies are often cited as ways of ensuring sufficient food production with less (or no) reliance on PPP. Whilst making useful contributions, these cannot fully replace PPP at the current time.  The conclusion must be that the current direction of policy in the area of PPP is likely to lead to considerable economic and social losses, with the gains, at best, uncertain or minimal.  Any policies should be science-led, and the assessment of risks undertaken on a proportionate basis. This will ensure a thriving agricultural sector and safe food for the UK population in future.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:45","2022-11-02T15:43:45Z",NA,"","2–78","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we assessed the effect of organic farming and landscape heterogeneity on pollinator communities, focusing on multivariate patterns in species composition and the taxonomic breadth of communities. By relating our results to patterns observed for species richness we show that: (1) species richness generally declines with decreasing landscape heterogeneity, but taxonomic breadth only declines with landscape heterogeneity on conventionally managed farms. We further highlight the importance to provide results of species composition analyses as (2) primarily hoverfly species benefited from organic farming, but three bee species from different families were favoured by conventionally managed farms and (3) two hoverfly species with aphidophagous larvae showed contrasting responses to landscape heterogeneity. These results advance the understanding of how landscape heterogeneity and farming practices alter insect communities and further suggest that diversity patterns need to be analysed beyond species richness to fully uncover consequences of agricultural intensification. © 2013 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","2013","2022-11-02 15:43:44","2022-11-02T15:43:44Z",NA,"540–546","","7","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agri-environment schemes; Agricultural intensification; Landscape context; Landscape ecology; Pollinators","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It later switched host to the Western honeybee (A. mellifera) and has now become a serious pest of that bee worldwide. The studies reported here on genotypic, phenotypic and reproductive variation among V. jacobsoni infesting A. cerana throughout Asia demonstrate that V. jacobsoni is a complex of at least two different species. In a new classification V. jacobsoni is here redefined as encompassing nine haplotypes (mites with distinct mtDNA CO-I gene sequences) that infest A. cerana in the Malaysia–Indonesia region. Included is a Java haplotype, specimens of which were used to first describe V. jacobsoni at the beginning of this century. A new name, V. destructor n. sp., is given to six haplotypes that infest A. cerana on mainland Asia. Adult females of V. destructor are significantly larger and less spherical in shape than females of V. jacobsoni and they are also reproductively isolated from females of V. jacobsoni. The taxonomic positions of a further three unique haplotypes that infest A. cerana in the Philippines is uncertain and requires further study. Other studies reported here also show that only two of the 18 different haplotypes concealed within the complex of mites infesting A. cerana have become pests of A. mellifera worldwide. Both belong to V. destructor, and they are not V. jacobsoni. The most common is a Korea haplotype, so-called because it was also found parasitizing A. cerana in South Korea. It was identified on A. mellifera in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Less common is a Japan/Thailand haplotype, so-called because it was also found parasitizing A. cerana in Japan and Thailand. It was identified on A. mellifera in Japan, Thailand and the Americas. Our results imply that the findings of past research on V. jacobsoni are applicable mostly to V. destructor. Our results will also influence quarantine protocols for bee mites, and may present new strategies for mite control.","2000","2022-11-02 15:43:44","2022-11-02T15:43:44Z",NA,"165–189","","3","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Varroa destructor; Varroa jacobsoni; genetic variation; mtDNA CO-I gene sequence","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since organic farming has the potential to mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity, it may also benefit crop pollination, but direct evidence of this is scant. We evaluated the effect of organic farming on pollination of strawberry plants focusing on (1) if pollination success was higher on organic farms compared to conventional farms, and (2) if there was a time lag from conversion to organic farming until an effect was manifested. We found that pollination success and the proportion of fully pollinated berries were higher on organic compared to conventional farms and this difference was already evident 2–4 years after conversion to organic farming. Our results suggest that conversion to organic farming may rapidly increase pollination success and hence benefit the ecosystem service of crop pollination regarding both yield quantity and quality.","2012","2022-11-02 15:43:43","2022-11-02T15:43:43Z",NA,"2–5","","2","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; conventional; organic; pollination; strawberries","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nutrition plays an important role in physiological stress resistance and by adjusting their intake of key nutrients, such as protein and carbohydrate, many animals can better resist stress. 2. Poor nutritionmay contribute to the widespread and on-going declines of honeybee populations by increasing their vulnerability to abiotic (e.g. pesticides) and biotic (e.g. diseases) stressors. How- ever, we do not know how nutrition affects stress resistance in social insects such as honeybees. 3. Here, we examined how exposure to the toxic secondary metabolite nicotine, a neurotoxin that shares structural similarities with the neonicotinoid pesticides, and low temperatures affected nutrient regulation in honeybees using the Geometric Framework of nutrition. 4. Groups of queenless, newly emerged worker bees were given diets containing specific ratios of protein and carbohydrate to determine, first, how toxin exposure and ambient temperature affected their nutrient intake and, secondly, how nutrition affected survival under stress. 5. We find that low temperatures and nicotine interacted to reduce survival in African honey- bees that ate low protein, high carbohydrate diets. However, bees fed a high protein diet were better able to survive insult with these interacting stressors. 6. Although protein conferred a survival benefit in honeybees exposed to these dual stressors, when allowed to self-select their diet, caged workers did not shift their intake towards a higher protein food to improve their survival under these stressful conditions. 7.

A systematic review of the relevant literature on the topic followed by a meta-analysis has been performed. Both the contact and oral acute LD 50 and the chronic LC 50 reported in laboratory studies for as many substances as possible have been extracted from the papers in order to compare the sensitivity to pesticides of honey bees and other bee species (Apiformes). The sensitivity ratio R between the endpoint for the species a (A. mellifera) and the species s (bees other than A. mellifera) was calculated for a total of 150 case studies including 19 bee species. A ratio higher than 1 indicated that the species s was more sensitive to pesticides than honey bees. The meta-analysis showed a high variability of sensitivity among bee species (R from 0.001 to 2085.7), however, in approximately 95 % of the cases the sensitivity ratio was below 10. The effect of pesticides in domestic and wild bees is dependent on the intrinsic sensitivity of single bee species as well as their specific life cycle, nesting activity and foraging behaviour. Current data indicates a need for more comparative information between honey bees and non-Apis bees as well as separate pesticide risk assessment procedures for non-Apis bees. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:39","2022-11-02T15:43:39Z",NA,"324–334","","3","23",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apiformes; Apis mellifera; Comparative ecotoxicology; Environmental risk assessment; Pollinators; Toxicity","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Organic farming, due to the absence of herbicides, can support the development of weeds and increase the ground cover compared to conventional farming. However, the benefits towards soil erosion, and the conservation potential of organic farming systems, in terms of herbicide application and weed growth, have not been investigated. Aim of this study was to identify how conventional and organic farming influence the erosion rate of soil, due to row crops cultivated on mountainous farmland in the presence or absence of agricultural chemicals. We measured multiple vegetation parameters of crops and weeds of conventional and organic farms cultivated with bean, potato, radish, and cabbage in a mountainous watershed in South Korea. We simulated the long-term soil erosion rates with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) by using 13years of recorded rainfall data in order to account for the temporal variability of monsoonal rainfall. We determined average annual erosion rates for the study area to be between 30.6tha-1yr-1 and 54.8tha-1yr-1, with maximum values when radish was grown, due to the shorter growing period, higher soil disturbance at harvest, and low amounts of residue. Organic farming reduced soil loss for radish by 18% as a result of a high weed biomass density and cover at the end of the growing season. For potato, organic farming increased soil loss by 25% due to a reduced crop coverage, which is suspected to have been a consequence of crop-weed competition or increased herbivory associated with the absence of agricultural chemicals. Our results demonstrate that organic farming can potentially decrease the soil erosion risk for row crops because it supports weed development in the furrows, but it can also produce higher erosion rates when crop yields are reduced as a consequence, outweighing the protective effect of the weeds. However, the simulated erosion rates under both farming systems exceeded by far any tolerable soil loss. We conclude that organic farming alone cannot be used to effectively control erosion, and that both farming systems require additional conservation measures, such as winter cover crops and residue mulching, to sufficiently prevent soil loss for row crop cultivation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:39","2022-11-02T15:43:39Z",NA,"89–105","","","219-220",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Farming system; Herbicide; Korea; Row crop; Soil erosion; Weed cover","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Commonly, more bumblebees visited GM eggplants compared to near-isogenic control, but this difference was only marginally significant. The mean length of feeding bouts was similar on the two treatments. Neither the number of flowers produced nor their size could explain bumblebees' tendency to prefer GM eggplants. Volatile compounds were extracted from five plants per genotype and separated using gas chromatography. Thirteen compounds were identified and five of them appeared significantly more abundant in GM eggplants. Six of the identified compounds [(+)-limonene, Z-jasmone, p-cymene, α-pinene, methyl-salicilate, and (-)-limonene] were tested in electrophysiological bioassays with antennas detached from young bumblebees, and a response was recorded in all six cases.

While increase in income decreases the pressure on forests, CO 2 damage and mineral extraction increase.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers are able to detect insecticidal proteins dissolved in sucrose solution and whether consumption of these proteins will affect survival and off- spring production. Feeders containing either Bacillus thuringiensis toxin (Cry1Ab), Kunitz soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), or Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) were offered to bumblebee colonies at low (0.01% wt/vol for SBTI and GNA, 0.001% for Cry1Ab) and high concentrations (0.1% for SBTI and GNA, 0.01% for Cry1Ab) together with a control (pure sucrose solution) in a glasshouse chamber. No difference was found in the number of visits and the duration of visits among the different concentrations for each of the insecticidal proteins, indicating that bumblebees do not discriminate the compounds. To investigate the impact of the different insecticidal proteins on B. terrestris , microcolonies were established by placing three newly emerged bumblebee workers in wooden boxes. Within a few days, a hierarchy in each microcolony was established and the dominant worker developed its ovaries and laid haploid eggs. Bumblebees were fed with Cry1Ab (0.01%), SBTI, or GNA (both at 0.01 and 0.1%) dissolved in sucrose solution and also fed mixed floral pollen for a maximum period of 80 days. Additionally, microcolonies with three drones each were established to measure individual bee longevity. While the Cry1Ab did not affect microcolony performance, the consumption of SBTI and especially GNA affected survival of B. terrestris workers and drones and caused a significant reduction in the number of offspring. The use of microcolonies appears to be well-suited to measure lethal and sublethal effects of insecticidal proteins expressed in transgenic plants on bumblebees.","2008","2022-11-02 15:43:35","2022-11-02T15:43:35Z",NA,"148–157","","2","126",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apidae; Bombus terrestris; Bt-toxin; GMO; Hymenoptera; Microcolonies; Risk assessment; Snowdrop lectin; Soybean trypsin inhibitor","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We evaluated the universality of both claims. For the first claim, we compared yields of organic versus conventional or low-intensive food production for a global dataset of 293 examples and estimated the average yield ratio (organic:non-organic) of different food categories for the developed and the developing world. For most food categories, the average yield ratio was slightly \textless1.0 for studies in the developed world and \textgreater1.0 for studies in the developing world. With the average yield ratios, we modeled the global food supply that could be grown organically on the current agricultural land base. Model estimates indicate that organic methods could produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population, and potentially an even larger population, without increasing the agricultural land base. We also evaluated the amount of nitrogen potentially available from fixation by leguminous cover crops used as fertilizer. Data from temperate and tropical agroecosystems suggest that leguminous cover crops could fix enough nitrogen to replace the amount of synthetic fertilizer currently in use. These results indicate that organic agriculture has the potential to contribute quite substantially to the global food supply, while reducing the detrimental environmental impacts of conventional agriculture. Evaluation and review of this paper have raised important issues about crop rotations under organic versus conventional agriculture and the reliability of grey-literature sources.

Research was conducted to evaluate effects of primary tillage (moldboard plowing and chisel plowing), secondary tillage (row cultivation), and herbicides on weed species changes in the soil seedbank in three irrigated row crop rotational sequences over a 3-yr period. The cropping sequences consisted of continuous corn for 3 yr, continuous pinto beans for 3 yr, or sugarbeets for 2 yr followed by corn in the third year. Cropping sequence was the most dominant factor influencing species composition in the seedbank. This was partly due to herbicide use in each cropping sequence producing a shift in the weed seedbank in favor of species less susceptible to applied herbicides. A comparison between moldboard and chisel plowing indicated that weed seed of predominant species were more prevalent near the soil surface after chisel plowing. The number of predominant annual weed seed over the 3-yr period increased more rapidly in the seedbank after chisel plowing compared to moldboard plowing unless effective weed control could be maintained to produce a decline in seedbank number. In this case, seedbank decline was generally more rapid after moldboard plowing. Row cultivation generally reduced seedbanks of most species compared to uncultivated plots in the pinto bean and sugarbeet sequences.

Lethal and sublethal effects of azadirachtin and cypermethrin were evaluated on adult and preimaginal stages of H. hebetor under laboratory conditions. Contact exposure bioassays with adults indicated that the lethal concentration (LC50) of two commercial azadirachtin-containing formulations, NeemGuard and BioNeem, were 43.5 and 10.2 microg a.i./ml, respectively. The LC50 of cypermethrin was 5.4 microg a.i./ml. When larval stage of H. hebetor was exposed to these insecticides with a field recommended concentration of NeemGuard, BioNeem, or cypermethrin by a dip protocol, the emergence rate was reduced by 39.0, 36.6, and 97.6%, respectively. To assay the sublethal effects of these insecticides, adult wasps were exposed to an LC30 concentration of the insecticides, and then demographic parameters of the surviving wasps were determined. Fecundity, fertility, and parameters including the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) were affected negatively. The r(m) values following exposure to NeemGuard, BioNeem, cypermethrin, or mock treatment were 0.143, 0.149, 0.160, and 0.179, respectively, female offspring per female per day, respectively. The current study showed that cypermethrin had more acute toxicity on larval and adult stages of H. hebetor compared with azadirachin. The commercial formulations of azadirachtin and cypermethrin negatively affected most of the life table parameters of the parasitoid.

In recent years, knowledge of ecological linkages between above- and belowground organ- isms has grown tremendously. Soil communities are extremely diverse, and when their interactions with plants influence floral characteristics, they have the potential to alter pollinator attrac- tion and visitation, but plant–pollinator interactions have been neglected in studies of the direct and indirect effects of soil organism–root interactions. Here, we review these belowground interactions, focusing on the effects of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root-feeding herbivores, and their effects on floral traits and pollinators.

Given the economic and ecological importance of bees, and the evidence of widespread population declines, the full impacts of pesticides and their interactions with other stressors in the environment need to be investigated. Here, we focus on the impacts of chronic exposure to the commonly used pyrethroid pesticide lambda (λ)-cyhalothrin on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris at both the individual and colony level. Furthermore, we investigated the interactions of pesticide exposure with a highly prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi. Colonies were exposed to λ-cyhalothrin in the laboratory, and colony growth and reproductive output were monitored for up to 14 weeks. The potential interactions between the pesticide and C. bombi were investigated by quantifying the impact of pesticide treatment on susceptibility to, and success of experimental infections, as well as the survival of workers. Male survival after larval pesticide exposure was also monitored. Pesticide-treated colonies produced workers with a significantly lower body mass. However, out of the twelve variables of colony development measured, this was the only metric that was significantly affected by pesticide treatment and there was no subsequent significant impact on the reproductive output of colonies. Lambda-cyhalothrin had no significant impact on the susceptibility of workers to C. bombi, or intensity of parasitic infection. Pesticide exposure did not cause differential survival in workers or males, even when workers were additionally challenged with C. bombi. Synthesis and applications. Chronic exposure to λ-cyhalothrin has a significant impact on worker size, a key aspect of bumblebee colony function, particularly under conditions of limited food resources. This could indicate that under times of resource limitation, colonies exposed to this pesticide in the field may fail. However, the lack of other impacts found in this study indicate that further field trials are needed to elucidate this. © 2013 The Authors.

However, there is little information available about the effect of introduced species on the structure of such networks. We compared uninvaded and invaded ecological communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the structure of Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. To attribute differences in pollination to the direct presence of the invasive species, areas were surveyed that contained similar native plant species cover, diversity and floral composition, with or without the invaders. Both invasive plant species received significantly more pollinator visits than any native species and invaders interacted strongly with pollinators. Overall, the pollinator community richness was similar in invaded and uninvaded plots, and only a few generalist pollinators visited invasive species exclusively. Invasive plants acted as pollination super generalists. The two species studied were visited by 43% and 31% of the total insect taxa in the community, respectively, suggesting they play a central role in the plant-pollinator networks. Carpobrotus and Opuntia had contrasting effects on pollinator visitation rates to native plants: Carpobrotus facilitated the visit of pollinators to native species, whereas Opuntia competed for pollinators with native species, increasing the nestedness of the plant-pollinator network. These results indicate that the introduction of a new species to a community can have important consequences for the structure of the plant-pollinator network.","2008","2022-11-02 15:43:27","2022-11-02T15:43:27Z",NA,"761–770","","4","155",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis; Ecological networks; Generalization; Interaction strength; Invasive species","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traits associated with a declining relative abundance include small dietary and phenological breadth and large body size. In addition, species with lower latitudinal range boundaries are increasing in relative abundance, a finding that may represent a response to climate change. We show that despite marked increases in human population density and large changes in anthropogenic land use, aggregate native species richness declines were modest outside of the genus Bombus.

These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceed in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., pheology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure ahs important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.","2007","2022-11-02 15:43:26","2022-11-02T15:43:26Z",NA,"567–593","","1","38",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In recent years, many once abundant and widespread species have shown sharp declines that have been cited by some as indicative of a widespread insect biodiversity crisis. Likely causes of these declines include agricultural intensification, light pollution, climate change, and urbanization; however, the real underlying cause(s) is still open to conjecture. We used data collected from the citizen science Garden Moth Scheme (GMS) to explore the spatial association between the abundance of 195 widespread British species of moth, and garden habitat and landscape features, to see if spatial habitat and landscape associations varied for species of differing conservation status. We found that associations with habitat and landscape composition were species-specific, but that there were consistent trends in species richness and total moth abundance. Gardens with more diverse and extensive microhabitats were associated with higher species richness and moth abundance; gardens near to the coast were associated with higher richness and moth abundance; and gardens in more urbanized locations were associated with lower species richness and moth abundance. The same trends were also found for species classified as increasing, declining and vulnerable under IUCN (World Conservation Union) criteria. However, vulnerable species were more strongly negatively affected by urbanization than increasing species. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain this observation: (1) that the underlying factors causing declines in vulnerable species (e.g., possibilities include fragmentation, habitat deterioration, agrochemical pollution) across Britain are the same in urban areas, but that these deleterious effects are more intense in urban areas; and/or (2) that urban areas can act as ecological traps for some vulnerable species of moth, the light drawing them in from the surrounding landscape into sub-optimal urban habitats.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:25","2022-11-02T15:43:25Z",NA,"1","","1","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recently, however, the ecological trap concept has been the subject of a flurry of theoretical activity that is likely to raise its profile substantially, particularly in conservation biology. Ecological trap theory suggests that, under most circumstances, the presence of a trap in a landscape will drive a local population to extinction. A number of empirical studies, almost all of birds, suggest the existence of traps and demonstrate the difficulties of recognizing them in the field. Evidence for ecological traps has primarily been found in habitats modified by human activities, either directly (e.g., through the mowing of grassland birds' nests) or indirectly (e.g., via human-mediated invasion of exotic species), but some studies suggest that traps may occur even in relatively pristine areas. Taken together, these theoretical and empirical results suggest that traps may be relatively common in rapidly changing landscapes. It is therefore important for conservation biologists to be able to identify traps and differentiate them from sinks. Commonly employed approaches for population modeling, which tend to assume a source-sink framework and do not consider habitat selection explicitly, may introduce faulty assumptions that mask the effects of ecological traps and lead to overly optimistic predictions about population persistence. Given the potentially dire consequences of ecological traps and the accumulating evidence for their existence, greater attention from the community of conservation biologists is warranted. In particular, it is important for conservation biologists and managers to incorporate into conservation planning an explicit understanding of the relationship between habitat selection and habitat quality. Resumen: El concepto de la trampa ecológica, hábitat de baja calidad que los animales prefieren por encima de otros hábitats disponibles, ha aparecido irregularmente en la literatura ecológica por más de 30 años, pero el tema ha recibido relativamente poca atención, y la evidencia sobre trampas es principalmente anecdótica. Sin embargo, el concepto de trampa ecológica recientemente ha sido sujeto de una agitada actividad teórica que probablemente eleve su perfil sustancialmente, particularmente en biología de la conservación. La teoría de la trampa ecológica sugiere que, bajo la mayoría de las circunstancias, la presencia de una trampa en un paisaje conducirá a una población local a la extinción. Numerosos estudios empíricos, casi todos de aves, sugieren la existencia de trampas y demuestran las dificultades para reconocerlas en el campo. La evidencia de trampas ecológicas ha sido encontrada principalmente en hábitats modificados por actividades humanas, ya sea directa (e.g. por siega de nidos de aves de pastizales) o indirectamente (e.g. por vía de invasiones de especies exóticas provocadas por humanos), pero algunos estudios sugieren que las trampas pueden ocurrir en áreas relativamente prístinas. En conjunto, estos resultados teóricos y empíricos sugieren que las trampas son relativamente comunes en paisajes con cambios rápidos. Por lo tanto, es importante que los biólogos de la conservación puedan identificar trampas y diferenciarlas de vertederos. Los métodos utilizados comúnmente para modelar poblaciones, que tienden a asumir un marco de fuente-vertedero y no consideran la selección hábitat explícitamente, pueden introducir suposiciones erróneas que enmascaran los efectos de las trampas ecológicas y conducen a predicciones demasiado optimistas acerca de la persistencia de la población. Dadas las consecuencias potencialmente desastrosas de las trampas ecológicas y la acumulación de evidencia de su existencia, se requiere una mayor atención por parte de la comunidad de biólogos de la conservación. Particularmente, es importante que los biólogos y los gestores de la conservación incorporen en la planificación de la conservación un entendimiento explícito de la relación entre selección de hábitat y calidad de hábitat.","2004","2022-11-02 15:43:25","2022-11-02T15:43:25Z",NA,"1482–1491","","6","18",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; calidad del hábitat; dinámica de poblaciones; ecological trap; fuente-vertedero; habitat quality; habitat selection; population dynamics; selección de hábitat; source-sink system; trampa ecológica","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.","2012","2022-11-02 15:43:24","2022-11-02T15:43:24Z",NA,"365–377","","4","15",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22257223",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Insecticides may elicit lethal and sublethal effects of different natures that may affect various biological systems of the honey bee. The first step in the induction of toxicity by a chemical is the interaction between the toxic compound and its molecular target. The action on the molecular target can lead to the induction of observable or non-visible effects. The toxic substance may impair important processes involved in cognitive functions, behaviour or integrity of physiological functions.

The insecticides were injected intra-thoracially between the third and the fourth segment. Biochemical effects were determined over a 3-h period. Both cypermethrin and fenitrothion led to a significant hypoglucosemia and hypotrehalosemia 15 min after injection, but cypermethrin seemed more active than fenitrothion at the same doses. A recovery phase appeared for glucosemia and trehalosemia, 60 min after injection. The higher toxicity of cypermethrin than fenitrothion also appeared in this period, where it took a longer time for honeybees to reestablish carbohydrate levels following cypermethrin than fenitrothion injections. The low values of the correlation coefficients (r) for glucose versus trehalose levels led to the supposition that no typical functional interaction between glucose and trehalose could be considered to be involved in this experience. Na+, K+- ATPases activity was significantly inhibited (P \textless 0.05) by cypermethrin and maximum percentage inhibition was reached (45%) at 1 nmol/bee. The kinetic analysis of honeybee's acetylcholinesterase inhibition by fenitrothion, indicated that this insecticide acts (P\textless 0.05) on acetylcholinesterase activity. The percentage inhibition exceeded 60% at 0.2 nmol/bee. This result revealed that in general cypermethrin and fenitrothion share common biochemical effects on carbohydrates, although their neurotoxic effects on honeybees might be different.","1999","2022-11-02 15:43:23","2022-11-02T15:43:23Z",NA,"139–146","","2","44",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Acetylcholinesterase; Carbohydrates; Cypermethrin; Fenitrothion; Honeybees; K+-ATPase; Na+; Toxicity","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species.

The high degree of variation in species' phenological shifts has raised concerns about the temporal decoupling of interspecific interactions, but the extent and implications of this effect are largely unknown. In the case of plant-pollinator systems, more specialized species are predicted to be particularly threatened by phenological decoupling, since they are assumed to be less flexible in the choice of interaction partners, but until now this hypothesis has not been tested. In this paper, we studied phenology and interactions of plant and pollinator communities along an altitudinal gradient in the Alps as a model for the possible effects of climate change in time. Our results show that even relatively specialized pollinators were much more flexible in their use of plant species as floral resources than their local flower visitation suggested. We found no relationship between local specialization of pollinators and the consistency of their visitation patterns across sites, and also no relationship between specialization and phenological synchrony of pollinators with particular plants. Thus, in contrast to the conclusions of a recent simulation study, our results suggest that most pollinator species included in this study are not threatened by phenological decoupling from specific flowering plants. However, the flexibility of many rarely observed pollinator species remains unknown. Moreover, our results suggest that specialized flower visitors select plant species based on certain floral traits such as the length of the nectar holder tube. If that is the case, the observed flexibility of plant-pollinator interactions likely depends on a high degree of functional redundancy in the plant community, which may not exist in less diverse systems.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:23","2022-11-02T15:43:23Z",NA,"639–650","","3","83",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Climate change; Ecological network; Elevation; Flowering; Mutualistic interaction; Phenological decoupling; Phenological mismatch; Phenological shift; Pollination","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on this model, and maintaining the current cropland areas and the performance of cropping and livestock systems in each region, we have assessed the possibilities of meeting the protein requirements of the estimated world population in 2050, according to various combinations of three critical drivers namely human diet (total amount of protein consumed and share of animal protein in this total), regional livestock production and crop fertilization intensity, in each region. The results show that feeding the projected 2050 world population would generally imply higher levels of inter-regional trade and of environmental nitrogen contamination than the current levels, but that the scenarios with less recourse to inter-regional trade generally produce less N losses to the environment. If an equitable human diet (in terms of protein consumption) is to be established globally (the same in all regions of the world), the fraction of animal protein should not exceed 40% of a total ingestion of 4 kgN capita(-1) yr(-1), or 25% of a total consumption of 5 kgN capita(-1) yr(-1). Our results show that slightly improving the agronomical performance in the most deficient regions (namely Maghreb, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and India) would make it possible not only to meet the global protein requirements with much less international trade (hence more food sovereignty), but also to reduce N environmental contamination the most efficiently.","2015-01","2022-11-02 15:43:22","2022-11-02T15:43:22Z",NA,"15","","2","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; agro-food systems; food security; human diet; nitrogen contamination; trade","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In reviewing the seven published studies on how alien species can affect the pollination success in natives, we found that all authors suggest competitive effects to dominate, either through reduced pollinator visitation rates or through increased heterospecific pollination of native flowers. Although certain pollinator interactions were competitive, the reproductive output in the native species was not always reduced. This implies that natives are not pollen limited, and/or that they compensate for the loss of pollinators by other animals. However, the few studies on pollination interactions between alien and native plant species show differing results. We therefore discuss other properties that can cause aliens to be strong interactors for pollination, and can modify how alien species affect the reproductive success in natives. We also emphasize the spatial scales addressed in the reviewed studies, as alien plant species may represent valuable food resources for many pollinators. Such plant species tend to be interpreted as competitive plants for pollination, whereas we stress their facilitative ability that may occur on a landscape scale by increasing pollinator densities. Additionally, while most studies tend to work within a shorter temporal scale, the impacts of the alien plant introductions may differ depending on the year or seasonal time leading to the differing results reported. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus of the paper is on three different key aspects determining the risks of neonicotinoid field concentrations for bee populations: (1) the environmental neonicotinoid residue levels in plants, bees and bee products in relation to pesticide application, (2) the reported side-effects with special attention for sublethal effects, and (3) the usefulness for the evaluation of neonicotinoids of an already existing risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds. Although environmental residue levels of neonicotinoids were found to be lower than acute/chronic toxicity levels, there is still a lack of reliable data as most analyses were conducted near the detection limit and for only few crops. Many laboratory studies described lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on the foraging behavior, and learning and memory abilities of bees, while no effects were observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages. The proposed risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds was shown to be applicable to assess the risk for side-effects of neonicotinoids as it considers the effect on different life stages and different levels of biological organization (organism versus colony). Future research studies should be conducted with field-realistic concentrations, relevant exposure and evaluation durations. Molecular markers may be used to improve risk assessment by a better understanding of the mode of action (interaction with receptors) of neonicotinoids in bees leading to the identification of environmentally safer compounds.","2012","2022-11-02 15:43:21","2022-11-02T15:43:21Z",NA,"1581","","5","21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22350105",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Acute; Agricultural; Agricultural: drug effects; Animals; Bees; Bees: drug effects; Chronic; Crops; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Monitoring: methods; Imidazoles; Imidazoles: toxicity; Insecticides; Insecticides: toxicity; Nitro Compounds; Nitro Compounds: toxicity; Pollination; Reproduction; Reproduction: drug effects; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Each zone was subdivided into burned and unburned areas, and a 150 x 30 ft. transect was set up in each, resulting in a total of eight transects across the habitat area; four each in burned and unburned areas. Xerces staff counted mardon skippers in each transect and in each zone on two independent monitoring dates in 2009, and on three dates each year in 2010, 2011 and 2013. Although mardon skipper numbers have improved in the burned sites compared to 2009, significantly fewer mardon skippers are still found in burned areas compared to unburned areas in all transects and zones.

We established stands of twelve native flowering perennial plant species in replicated plots ranging in size from 1 to 100m2. These plots were sampled for insect pollinators, bloom richness, and seed production by three wildflower species. Honeybees, wild bees, and hoverflies all responded positively to increasing flower richness, whereas particular insect pollinator groups responded differently to the size of the flowering plant area. The density of honeybees and hoverflies was not affected by increasing flowering patch size, whereas in general, wild bees were observed at higher density and diversity in the 30 and 100m2 patches. Increasing wildflower patch size, and thus wild bee density, resulted in greater seed set in the sampled wildflowers. These results indicate that wild bees are sensitive to the area and richness of floral resources in patches, even at relatively small scales. Therefore, larger wildflower plantings with more diverse flower species mixes are more suitable for the conservation of wild pollinators and reproduction of sown species.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:21","2022-11-02T15:43:21Z",NA,"701–711","","8","15",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Ecosystem service; Honeybees; Perennial; Richness; Syrphidae; Wild bees","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here I propose to distinguish two possible implications of network patterns in conjunction with solutions to avoid misinterpretations. Interpretations can be either(1)niche-based, describing specialisation, trait (mis-)matching between species, niche breadth and niche overlap and their relationship to interspecific competition and species coexistence, or(2)impact-based, focusing on frequencies of interactions between species such as predation or infection rates and mutualistic services, aiming to quantify each species' relative contribution to an ecological effect. For niche-based implications, it is crucial to acknowledge the sampling limitations of a network and thus control for the number of observations of each species. This is particularly important for those kinds of networks that summarise observed interactions in communities (e.g. bipartite host-parasitoid or plant-animal networks), rather than compile information from different sources or experiments (as in many food webs). Variation in total observation frequencies may alone explain network patterns that have often been interpreted as 'specialisation asymmetries' (nestedness, dependence asymmetries). I show analytically that 'dependence asymmetries' between two species (or two guilds) only reflect variation in their total observation frequencies. To depict true asymmetries in niche breadth, independent data are required for both species. Moreover, simulated co-extinction scenarios assume that each species 'depends' on its associated partners in the network (again niche-based), but species that appear most endangered are simply those with one or very few observations and are not necessarily specialised. Distinguishing niche-based and impact-based interpretations may help to bridge terminological and conceptual gaps between network pattern analyses and traditional community ecology. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","2010","2022-11-02 15:43:20","2022-11-02T15:43:20Z",NA,"185–195","","3","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Ecological networks; Ecological niche; Mutualism; Nestedness; Parasitism; Sampling effects; Specialisation asymmetry; Species extinctions","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we explore the effects on adult morphology and female fitness of larval semi-starvation in the butterfly Speyeria mormonia. Using a split-brood design, food intake was reduced by approximately half during the last half of the last larval instar. Body mass and forewing length of resulting adults were smaller than those of control animals. Feeding treatment significantly altered the allometric relationship between mass and wing length for females but not males, such that body mass increased more steeply with wing length in stressed insects as compared to control insects. This may result in changes in female flight performance and cost. With regard to adult life history traits, male feeding treatment or mating number had no effect on female fecundity or survival, in agreement with expectations for this species. Potential fecundity decreased with decreasing body mass and relative fat content, but there was no independent effect of larval feeding treatment. Realized fecundity decreased with decreasing adult survival, and was not affected by body mass or larval feeding treatment. Adult survival was lower in insects subjected to larval semi-starvation, with no effect of body mass. In contrast, previous laboratory studies on adult nectar restriction showed that adult survival was not affected by such stress, whereas fecundity was reduced in direct 11 proportion to the reduction of adult food. We thus see a direct impact of larval dietary restriction on survival, whereas fecundity is affected by adult dietary restriction, a pattern reminiscent of a survival/reproduction trade-off, but across a developmental boundary. The data, in combination with previous work, thus provide a picture of the intra-specific response of a suite of traits to ecological stress.","2005","2022-11-02 15:43:19","2022-11-02T15:43:19Z",NA,"353–361","","3","144",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Fecundity; Nymphalidae; Stress; Survival; Trade-offs","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We found a highly dynamic community of 252 bee and wasp species (representing 18.8 % of total bee and wasp species known from the Czech Republic) that utilized 1–7-year-old burned forest stands. Species richness in the burned forest stands was significantly higher than that recorded in nearby forest that had been unaffected by any recent fire. The unburned forest hosted only 88 species. We found 42 red-listed species, of which 40 were present in the burned forest, while only 12 were present in the control forest. Numerous early- and late-responding spe- cies were detected, but maximum species diversity was reached 3 years after the fire. Only 7 of the total of 261 species were limited to the forest that was unaffected by any recent fire. A management regime that supported the presence of bare sand and heather patches, and removal of all but solitary pine trees, was found to be insufficient to support the full spectrum of forest fire-dependent species. This was mainly due to the absence of charred or decaying dead wood, which is otherwise utilized by numerous red- listed cavity adopters that are absent in the surrounding cultural landscape. Retaining part of the charred trunks is suggested as a novel post-fire conservation measure.","2015","2022-11-02 15:43:19","2022-11-02T15:43:19Z",NA,"153–166","","1","134",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Dipogon vechti; Forest fire; Miscophus niger; Passaloecus monilicornis; Sandstone rock formations; Sphecodes marginatus","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the GMHT treatment, there were fewer dicots and monocots than in conventional crops. At harvest, dicot biomass and seed rain in the GMHT treatment were one-third of that in the conventional, while monocot biomass was threefold greater and monocot seed rain almost fivefold greater in the GMHT treatment than in the conventional. These differential effects persisted into the following two years of the rotation. Bees and Butterflies that forage and select for dicot weeds were less abundant in GMHT WORS management in July.

In this review, we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000 tonnes active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of in-secticides (i.e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3) they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects. The toxicity persists for a variable period of time— depending on the plant, its growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. A wide variety of applications are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all environmental compart-ments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the cen-tral nervous system of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while fipronil inhibits neuro-nal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate neu-rons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all insecticides, they can also have lethal and suble-thal impacts on non-target organisms, including insect preda-tors and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate, coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose seri-ous risks of undesirable environmental impacts.","2015","2022-11-02 15:43:17","2022-11-02T15:43:17Z",NA,"1–154","","1","22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; 0f; agriculture; animals; arthropods; ca; case studies; chemical control; chordata; ec; ecosystem services; environmental effects; environmental impact; eukaryotes; eukaryotic cells; ff620; fipronil; forest pests; forestry; hexapoda; hh405; hh430; hq; insect control; insect pests; insects; invertebrates; kg; kk100; mechanism of action; metabolites; mode of action; neonicotinoid insecticides; neonicotinoids; nicotinoid insecticides; non-target organisms; non-target species; nontarget effects; nontarget organisms; nontarget species; pe; pest control; pest insects; plant pests; pp600; pp710; qc; tr; vertebrates; wildlife; xx700","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

After accounting for management interventions, bee abundance improved coffee production (number of berries harvested). Some management interventions, such as irrigation, used once to trigger asynchronous flowering, dramatically increased bee abundance at coffee trees. Others, such as the extent and type of tree cover, revealed interacting effects on pollination and, ultimately, crop production. The effects of management interventions, notably irrigation and addition of lime, had, however, far more substantial positive effects on coffee production than tree cover. These results suggest that pollination services matter, but managing the asynchrony of flowering was a more effective tool for securing good pollination than maintaining high shade tree densities as pollinator habitat. Complex interactions across farm and landscape scales, including both management practices and environmental conditions, shape pollination outcomes.

Impacted communities can exhibit transient dynamics in response to such environmental changes, where slow extinctions and immigration delay the arrival to a new equilibrium. Life history traits such as generation time, resource use and dispersal capacity, as well as landscape history can be expected to affect possible extinction debt, but few have examined this for multiple taxa in the same study and particularly so for arthropods. The aim was to assess under which current and historical land use circumstances an extinction debt occurs for vascular plants and three insect taxa. Location: South-eastern Sweden. Method: We sampled current species richness of habitat specialist and generalist butterflies, bees, hoverflies, and vascular plants in 45 dry to mesic semi-natural grassland fragments of various size and degree of connectivity, and situated in landscapes with contrasting land use conversion history. Habitat loss was estimated in each landscape by comparing modern maps to ∼45 year old digitized aerial photographs. An extinction debt can be assumed if historical habitat size and connectivity better explain current species distribution than current habitat variables do. Results: Bees responded rapidly to habitat loss possibly as a result of their primary nesting resource being destroyed. Interestingly, species richness of specialist plants was best explained by historical habitat connectivity, richness of hoverflies by historical habitat area, and richness of butterflies by both historical habitat area and connectivity, indicating extinction debt for these taxa. Habitat generalist butterflies and hoverflies, but not plants and bees, exhibited extinction debt mainly in relation to habitat area. No effect of landscape type was found on the observed extinction debt. Main conclusions: Slow extinctions of persistent and long-lived plants might explain extinction debt for both plants and herbivorous insects linked to these plants. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:17","2022-11-02T15:43:17Z",NA,"591–599","","5","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Conservation; Extinction debt; Grassland communities; Habitat loss; Landscape change; Relaxation time","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper we investigate the effects of sub-lethal dosesof imidacloprid on foraging activity and homing ability of honey bees. Honey bees from one hive were trained to forage on an artificial feeder filled with a 50% sucrose solution. The feeder was gradually moved up to a distance of 500 meters from the hive. Thirty bees, foraging on the sucrose solution, were captured, individually marked with coloured number tags and transferred into a flying cage, acting as control. The feeder was then replaced with a new one, filled with an imidacloprid supplemented sucrose solution. Again, thirty bees foraging on this feeder were captured, individually marked with different coloured number tags and transferred into another flying cage. Three concentrations of imidacloprid were tested: 100 ppb, 500 ppb and 1000 ppb. The solutions at 500 ppb and 1000 ppb of imidacloprid had a repellent effect and the bees stopped visiting the feeder, hence only 10 and 20 honey bees, respectively, were captured for the two doses. Since the effects of imidacloprid start half an hour to one hour after ingestion, bees were released from the flying cage 1 hour after confinement. After the release, the behaviour of the bees was followed for 2 hours: two observers at the hive and one observer at the feeding site recorded the arrival and the departure of the marked bees. The presence of the bees at the hive and at the feeder was also recorded for one hour, 5 and 24 hours after the release. The results show that almost all the control honey bees returnedto the hive, and started again visiting the feeder between 2 to 5 hours after the release. Honey beesfed with the concentration of 100 ppb also returned to the hive, but they returned to visitthe feeder only 24 hours after the release.

Rates of parasitism were measured in both managed and wild trap-nested populations. Only two parasites, the drosophilid fly Cacoxenus sp., and the cleptoparasitic mite Chaetodactylus osmiae, were found in wild populations, but their rates of parasitism rarely exceeded 10%. Cacoxenus was never found in managed populations, but the torymid wasp Monodontomerus obsoletus caused serious damage in some populations when bee cocoons were made accessible by extricating them from nesting materials in the laboratory. Chaetodactylus osmiae was also present in managed populations but in low numbers. In 1991, a population of O. cornuta was released in an almond orchard. As opposed to other releases in which 'clean' populations were used, in this release some cells infested with C. osmiae, Cacoxenus sp., and M. obsoletus were intentionally introduced with the bee population. No cell was reparasitized by Cacoxenus sp., because by the time these drosophilids became adults the flying season of the O. cornuta population was almost over. On the other hand, the number of cells infested with C. osmiae mites increased to six times the number of infested cells originally introduced. Most M. obsoletus developed normally, and parasitism by this wasp increased slightly (from 20 to 30 cells). As O. cornuta flies very early in the season when few species of parasites or nest destroyers are active, the diversity of associated fauna is usually lower in O. cornuta nests than in nests of other, related, later-flying species such as O. rufa and O. tricornis.","1992","2022-11-02 15:43:15","2022-11-02T15:43:15Z",NA,"77–82","","2","31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Cacoxenus sp; Chaetodactylus osmiae; Monodontomerus obsoletus; Osmia cornuta; Parasitism; Pollinators; Spain","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While habitat disturbance has been shown to reduce the abundance and species richness of native bee species, a comprehensive study of the impacts of disturbance on plant reproductive success is lacking. In a meta-analysis of 41 studies we show that, overall, habitat disturbance is associated with a decrease in fruit set. Moreover, the magnitude of this effect depends on disturbance type. The presence of livestock or fire in a plant's habitat was associated with a reduction in fruit set, whereas the presence of human use, deforestation, or agricultural use was associated with a non-significant trend in the same direction. We also examined the potential for plant traits to influence a species' response to disturbance. We found that tropical plants suffered a greater impact of habitat disturbance than temperate plants, as did plants with dry relative to fleshy fruit types. No differences were found between woody and herbaceous plants, or between crops and non-crop species. Self-incompatible species in disturbed temperate habitats suffered a greater reduction in fruit set than self-compatible species, suggesting a role of pollination on the effect of the disturbance. Our results indicate that while species' responses to habitat disturbance are highly variable, certain plant traits could serve to predict the impact of a disturbance on a species' reproductive success.

RNA viruses associated with honeybees represent a potential threat to other insect pollinators, but the extent of this threat is poorly understood. This study aims to attain a detailed understanding of the current and ongoing risk of emerging infectious disease (EID) transmission between managed and wild pollinator species across a wide range of RNA viruses. Within a structured large-scale national survey across 26 independent sites, we quantify the prevalence and pathogen loads of multiple RNA viruses in co-occurring managed honeybee (Apis mellifera) and wild bumblebee (Bombus spp.) populations. We then construct models that compare virus prevalence between wild and managed pollinators. Multiple RNA viruses associated with honeybees are widespread in sympatric wild bumblebee populations. Virus prevalence in honeybees is a significant predictor of virus prevalence in bumblebees, but we remain cautious in speculating over the principle direction of pathogen transmission. We demonstrate species-specific differences in prevalence, indicating significant variation in disease susceptibility or tolerance. Pathogen loads within individual bumblebees may be high and in the case of at least one RNA virus, prevalence is higher in wild bumblebees than in managed honeybee populations. Our findings indicate widespread transmission of RNA viruses between managed and wild bee pollinators, pointing to an interconnected network of potential disease pressures within and among pollinator species. In the context of the biodiversity crisis, our study emphasizes the importance of targeting a wide range of pathogens and defining host associations when considering potential drivers of population decline.","2015","2022-11-02 15:43:14","2022-11-02T15:43:14Z",NA,"615–624","","3","84",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apis; Bombus; Decline; Pathogen; Spillover","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Pampas experienced little human intervention until the last decades of the 19th century. Agriculture expanded quickly during the 20th century, transforming grasslands into cropland and pasture lands and converting the landscape into a mosaic of natural fragments, agricultural fields, and linear habitats. In the 1980s, agriculture intensification and replacement of cattle grazingcropping systems by continuous cropping promoted a renewed homogenisation of the most productive areas. Birds and carnivores were more strongly affected than rodents and insects, but responses varied within groups: (a) the geographic ranges and/or abundances of many native species were reduced, including those of carnivores, herbivores, and specialist species (grassland-adapted birds and rodents, and probably specialized pollinators), sometimes leading to regional extinction (birds and large carnivores), (b) other native species were unaffected (birds) or benefited (bird, rodent and possibly generalist pollinator and crop-associated insect species), (c) novel species were introduced, thus increasing species richness of most groups (26% of non-rodent mammals, 11.1% of rodents, 6.2% of birds, 0.8% of pollinators). Much taxonomic and ecological work is still needed to understand Pampean animal biodiversity, to understand how agriculturization is affecting it, and to identify appropriate conservation actions. Networks of Important Bird Areas and Valuable Grassland Areas harbor a balanced representation of Pampean biodiversity and, if adequately protected, may provide valuable research sites, but complementary work should be carried out on agriculturized areas.","2011","2022-11-02 15:43:13","2022-11-02T15:43:13Z",NA,"3077–3100","","13","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Birds; Grasslands; Insects; Other vertebrates; Pollinators; Rodents","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goal of our study is to assess the influence of changing macroclimate, competition and habitat connectivity on the migration rates of 14 tree species. We also compare the projections of range shifts from species distribution models (SDMs) that incorporate realistic migration rates with classical models that assume no or unlimited migration. Location Europe. Methods We calibrated SDMs with species abundance data from 5768 forest plots from ICP Forest Level 1 in relation to climate, topography, soil and land-use data to predict current and future tree distributions. To predict future species ranges from these models, we applied three migration scenarios: no migration, unlimited migration and realistic migration. The migration rates for the SDMs incorporating realistic migration were estimated according to macroclimate, interspecific competition and habitat connectivity from simulation experiments with a spatially explicit process model (TreeMig). From these relationships, we then developed a migration cost surface to constrain the predicted distributions of the SDMs. Results The distributions of early-successional species during the 21st century predicted by SDMs that incorporate realistic migration matched quite well with the unlimited migration assumption (mean migration rate over Europe for A1fi/GRAS climate and land-use change scenario 156.7 +/- 79.1 m year(-1) and for B1/SEDG 164.3 +/- 84.2 m year(-1)). The predicted distributions of mid-to late-successional species matched better with the no migration assumption (A1fi/GRAS, 15.2 +/- 24.5 m year(-1) and B1/SEDG, 16.0 +/- 25.6 m year(-1)). Inter-specific competition, which is higher under favourable growing conditions, reduced range shift velocity more than did adverse macroclimatic conditions (i.e. very cold or dry climate). Habitat fragmentation also led to considerable time lags in range shifts. Main conclusions Migration rates depend on species traits, competition, spatial habitat configuration and climatic conditions. As a result, re-adjustments of species ranges to climate and land-use change are complex and very individualistic, yet still quite predictable. Early-successional species track climate change almost instantaneously while mid-to late-successional species were predicted to migrate very slowly.","2012","2022-11-02 15:43:13","2022-11-02T15:43:13Z",NA,"164–178","","2","21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22444757",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Climate change projection; Dynamic vegetation model; Environmental gradient; Generalized linear models; Migration limitation; Species distribution model; TreeMig","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Numerous mechanisms could be behind this decline, and the spread of parasites from commercial colonies into wild populations has been implicated recently in North America. Commercial breeding may lead to declines because commercial colonies may have high parasite loads, which can lead to colonization of native bumble bee populations; commercial rearing may allow higher parasite virulence to evolve; and global movement of commercial colonies may disrupt spatial patterns in local adaptation between hosts and parasites. We assessed parasite virulence, transmission mode, and infectivity. Microparasites and so-called honey bee viruses may pose the greatest threat to native bumble bee populations because certain risk factors are present; for example, the probability of horizontal transmission of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi is high. The microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi may play a role in declines of bumble bees in the United States. Preliminary indications that C. bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi may not be native in parts of South America.

While the presence of Al in nectar did not influence foraging patterns by bumblebees, flowers containing Ni nectar solutions were visited for shorter time periods relative to controls, and discouraged bees from visiting nearby Ni-contaminated flowers.

Here, we present a model to study the effect of introgression from multiple plantations into the whole metapopulation of the wild relative. The most important result of the model is that even very low levels of introgression and selection can lead to a high probability that the transgene goes to fixation in the metapopulation. Furthermore, the overall frequency of the transgene in the metapopulation, after a certain number of generations of introgression, depends on the population dynamics. If there is a high rate of migration or a high rate of population turnover, the overall transgene frequency is much higher than with lower rates. However, under an island model of population structure, this increased frequency has only a very small effect on the probability of fixation of the transgene. Considering these results, studies on the potential ecological risks of introgression from GM plants should look not only at the rate of introgression and selection acting on the transgene, but also at the metapopulation dynamics of the wild relative.","2009","2022-11-02 15:43:11","2022-11-02T15:43:11Z",NA,"160–171","","2","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Gene flow; Genetically modified organisms; Introgression; Population structure; Transgene","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is particularly relevant in a crop such as lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium, where no fruit will set without insect-mediated cross-pollination. However, such valuations usually ignore other factors that are necessary to maximise crop yields. We conducted an experiment to test whether yields of lowbush blueberry attributed to pollinator activity increased independently of pest management. The experiment was a 2√ó2 factorial design, incorporating two intensities of pollination (25% or 100% of flowers), and two levels of insect and disease management with recommended fungicide and insecticide sprays ('full inputs' or 'no inputs'). We demonstrated an interaction between these two factors, such that increased fruit set at harvest was only possible if 100% pollination was combined with the 'full input' treatment. Furthermore, increases in fruit weight among the remaining treatments were only realised in the 'full input' plots. These results suggest that the value accorded to pollinator activity in blueberries is strongly dependent upon pest and disease management of the crop. ¬© 2014 Association of Applied Biologists.","2014","2022-11-02 15:43:10","2022-11-02T15:43:10Z",NA,"387–394","","3","165",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Berry yield; Bombus impatiens; Vaccinium angustifolium; fruit set; plant limits","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Less well appreciated is the possibility that climate change could cause extinction by changing the ecological interactions between species. If ecologists, land managers and policy makers are to manage farmland biodiversity sustainably under global climate change, they need to understand the ways in which species interact with each other as this will affect the way they respond to climate change. Here, we consider the ability of nectar flower mixtures used in field margins to provide sufficient forage for bumble-bees under future climate change. We simulated the effect of global warming on the network of plant-pollinator interactions in two types of field margin: a four-species pollen and nectar mix and a six-species wildflower mix. While periods without flowering resources and periods with no food were rare, curtailment of the field season was very common for the bumble-bees in both mixtures. The effect of this, however, could be ameliorated by adding extra species at the start and end of the flowering season. The plant species that could be used to future-proof margins against global warming are discussed.","2010","2022-11-02 15:43:10","2022-11-02T15:43:10Z",NA,"2071–2079","","1549","365",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bumble-bee; Climate change; Field margin","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial (mutualistic) ecological interactions between species even before extinctions occur. We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitats, that between plants and their animal pollinators, via climate change. We used a highly resolved empirical network of interactions between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant species to simulate consequences of the phenological shifts that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO(2). Depending on model assumptions, phenological shifts reduced the floral resources available to 17-50% of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. Reduced overlap between plants and pollinators also decreased diet breadth of the pollinators. The predicted result of these disruptions is the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions.","2007","2022-11-02 15:43:09","2022-11-02T15:43:09Z",NA,"710–717","","8","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17594426",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Climate; Insects; Master Expert; Master Expert-Key Papers; Network; Phenology; Plants; Pollination","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We explored probable patterns of extinction in two large networks of plants and flower visitors by simulating the removal of pollinators and consequent loss of the plants that depend upon them for reproduction. For each network, we removed pollinators at random, systematically from least-linked (most specialized) to most-linked (most generalized), and systematically from most- to least-linked. Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with preferential removal of the most-linked pollinators, but declines were no worse than linear. This relative tolerance to extinction derives from redundancy in pollinators per plant and from nested topology of the networks. Tolerance in pollination networks contrasts with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The discrepancy may be a result of the method used: previous studies removed species from multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our preferential removal of pollinators reflects their greater risk of extinction relative to that of plants. In both pollination networks, the most-linked pollinators were bumble-bees and some solitary bees. These animals should receive special attention in efforts to conserve temperate pollination systems. © 2004 The Royal Society.","2004","2022-11-02 15:43:08","2022-11-02T15:43:08Z",NA,"2605–2611","","1557","271",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Conservation; Food webs; Generalization; Nestedness; Pollination; Redundancy","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, large-scale breeding for agricultural purposes still needs development. A bottleneck is the small number of queens generally found in the colonies of most species. A proposed solution is to develop in vitro rearing of stingless bee queens, which includes a technical support due to the massive liquid feeding of larvae. In this study, we tested the efficacy of in vitro queen-rearing techniques in terms of queen size, survival, and fecundity. We found that humidity must be kept high during the first 6 days of larval development and reduced thereafter to 75 %. In the most effective treatments, we obtained up to 97.9 % queen survival. We also found that queens not different in size from natural queens could be produced if sufficient larval food is provided. In vitro queens were able to mate and lay viable eggs. This methodology is also useful for several research appliances, like pesticide effect on bees, pollen quality effect in caste determination, and the use of genetic sources for selection programs, among others.","2013","2022-11-02 15:43:06","2022-11-02T15:43:06Z",NA,"491–500","","5","44",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Meliponini; Scaptotrigona depilis; colony multiplication; meliponiculture; pollinator","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The experiments showed honeyeater birds (tui, bellbirds, and silvereyes) had little effect on the honeydew, but that cropping by German wasps (Vespula germanica), and particularly by common wasps (V. vulgaris), in the summer and autumn months markedly reduced the number, size, and sugar concentration of the honeydew drops. The energy in drops per unit area of tree trunk was reduced by at least 99.1 %, 98.4%, and 91.3% in January, March, and May, respectively. Wasps reduced the standing crop (number, size, and sugar concentration) of the honeydew drops by cropping them before they could be fully recharged and before evaporation could concentrate the sugars. Cropping by feral honey bees (Apis mellifera) may have reduced the standing crop of honeydew slightly. Removal of the honeydew by the introduced social wasps threatens the existence of some New Zealand native animals. The wasps reduce honeydew abundance and quality to the extent that honey bees do not feed on it for 3-4 months of the year.","1991","2022-11-02 15:42:59","2022-11-02T15:42:59Z",NA,"171–179","","2",18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Beech; Competition; Conservation; Honeydew; Standing crop; Wasps","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, owing to their intensive use, there exists a debate regarding the involvement of this microbial insecticide in beecolony losses. In this study, inatiered approach using laboratory microcolonies, an evaluation was made of the potential lethaland sublethal hazardson colony reproduction and for aging behaviour of workers of the bumblebee Bombusterrestris (L.) of two commercial Bt strains: kurstaki (Dipel®) and aizawai (Xentari®). Bumblebees, like honey bees, are intensively used in modern agriculture for pollination and fulfil a crucial role in the natural ecosystem. Results: Exposure of bumble bees dermally or viatreated pollen to either of the two Btformulations at their fielder commended rates (0.1%) caused no reduction in survival. However, when applied in the feeding sugar water, aizawai killed all workers at a concentration of 0.1%, but this lethal effect was lost at 0.01%. With respect to reproductive effects, kurstaki was harmless, while aizawai at 0.1% delivered in the feeding sugar water and pollen reduced reproduction by 100 and 31% respectively. Lower doses of 0.01% aizawai in the sugar water showed no more effect. In addition, kurstaki at 0.1% and aizawai at 0.01% in the feeding sugar water did not impair the foraging behaviour, resulting in normal nest colony performance. Conclusion: The results with kurstaki and aizawai demonstrated that, in general, the Bt strains are safe to B. terrestris bumblebees, although in some cases there were detrimental effects that dependedon strain and route of exposure. In addition, the authors believe that to draw firm conclusions regarding the hazards of Bt to bumblebees would require more information on relevant concentrations of Bt products in the environment.

In the current pollinator decline, V. velutina is an additional stressor for honeybees and other pollinators. Although V. velutina contributes to the loss of honeybee colonies, little is known about its biology and behaviour both in the native and in the invaded area. Here, we review the current knowledge of this species and describe its life cycle and life history traits (reproduction, overwintering, foraging and dispersal) in the light of the biology of other Vespidae. We also review the impact of this species on ecosystems, on the economics of beekeeping, and on human health (this species being potentially deadly for allergic people). Based on this information and on previous worldwide experiences with Vespidae invasions, we propose key research topics for the development of effective management plans. We identify methods to limit the impact and proliferation of V. velutina in Europe that are based on nest destruction, trapping, population genetics, and biological control. In our opinion, research effort on the means to detect and destroy V. velutina nests at an early stage is required in order to short-circuit the colony cycle and thus limit both its impact on honeybees and its expansion through Europe. Finally, we discuss the impact of this biological invasion on the development of methods that should be used to manage alien species in the future.","2014","2022-11-02 15:42:51","2022-11-02T15:42:51Z",NA,"1–16","","1",87,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apis mellifera; Biodiversity; Invasive species; Pest management; Vespidae; Yellow-legged hornet","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Alterations in land use and biological invasions are two major components of global change that threaten biodiversity. There is high concern about their impact on pollinators and the pollination services they provide. However, the growing literature shows different, even contradictory results. 2. We present a global meta-analysis of 58 publications reporting 143 studies (37 on landscape alteration and 21 on biological invasions) to assess the extent to which these components affect pollinators, and whether taxonomic and ecosystem-type differences in pollinator responses occur. We also quantified which component of landscape alteration had the largest effect on pollinators and assessed whether animal invasions differ from plant invasions in their effect on native pollinators. 3. Habitat alteration and invasions affected pollinators to the same magnitude by decreasing visitation rates. Vertebrates in altered landscapes and insects (excluding bees) in invaded areas were the most affected pollinator taxa. 4. Pollinator abundance was more reduced in altered forest ecosystems than in altered grasslands; while the reverse pattern was found for pollinator richness. However, the response of pollinators to invasions was independent of ecosystem type. 5. Disturbance of the surrounding matrix was more important in decreasing pollinator visitation rates than fragment size. 6. Invasive animals seemed to have a more consistent negative effect on visitation rates than invasive plants. 7. Synthesis.

First, agriculture produces a wide array of local and national nonmarket goods and services (in addition to market commodities) collectively known as multifunctionality of agriculture. Second, agriculture is intimately associated with global public goods of grave importance to humanity such as climate change, sustainability, and food security (poverty/hunger) in developing countries that require transnational cooperation to minimize free-rider and consequent under-provision problems. Third, embodying the first and second problems, agriculture plays distinctively different roles across countries. Specifically, this article views the global agriculture as consisting of four broad groups of countries with widely divergent needs from agriculture. This article concludes that the above agriculture-related problems are too diverse and complex to be left to free trade.

The challenge is how to synthesize the growing list of such observations with a coherent body of theory that will enable us to predict where and when changes will occur, what the consequences might be for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and what we might do practically in order to maintain those systems in as good condition as possible. It is thus necessary to investigate the effects of climate change at the ecosystem level and to consider novel emergent ecosystems composed of new species assemblages arising from differential rates of range shifts of species. Here, we present current knowledge on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services supply, and summarize the papers included in this volume. We discuss how resilient ecosystems are in the face of the multiple components that characterize climate change, and suggest which current ecological theories may be used as a starting point to predict ecosystem-level effects of climate change.","2010","2022-11-02 15:42:39","2022-11-02T15:42:39Z",NA,"2013–2018","","1549",365,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 823",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Biodiversity; Biotic interactions; Climate change; Ecological networks; Ecosystem services; Resilience","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A large-scale survey in Patagonia reveals that, in 5 years post-arrival, the highly invasive B terrestris has become the most abundant and widespread Bombus species, and its south- ward spread is concurrent with the geographic retraction of the only native species, Bombus dahlbomii. Furthermore, a 20-year survey of pollinators of the endemic herb Alstroemeria aurea in northern Patagonia indicates that B ruderatus and B terrestris have replaced B dahlbomii, formerly the most abundant pollina- tor. Although the decline's underlying mechanisms remain unknown, the potential roles of exploitative competition and pathogen co-introduction cannot be ruled out. Given that invasive bumble bees can rapidly extirpate native congeners, further introductions should be discouraged.","2013","2022-11-02 15:42:37","2022-11-02T15:42:37Z",NA,"529–534","","10",11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We assessed wild bee populations in canola fields in an agriculturally intense area where virtually all land was either tilled agricultural fields or semi-natural grazed pasturelands, with the expectation that mosaics of land use types may better support ecosystem services than homogenous crop areas. Fields were chosen in two categories, five with little or no pastureland (\textless6%) and five with at least 15% pastureland within an 800 m distance of field edges. Fields in the high pasture category had more bumble bees and other wild bees than low pasture fields and 94% of the variation in bumble bee abundance in fields was explained by variation in the amount of pastureland nearby. Lower bee abundance in fields with little pastureland around them could result in reduced pollination and seed set unless supplemented with managed pollinators such as honeybees. In areas with intense agriculture we show that mosaics of land use types can be better for wild bee populations and potentially for crop production than landscapes that are homogenous tilled crop areas.

Concern has been expressed that it might act as an invasive species with large impact on biodiversity. However, although the honeybee has spread into the wild and has established feral populations in Australia and the Americas, the extent to which introduced honeybees alter biodiversity remains controversial. Here we focus on the best documented cases of A. mellifera invasions and discuss the effects on biodiversity under three different conditions: 1) regions where other subspecies of A. mellifera are endemic (Europe, Africa, and western Asia), 2) regions where A. mellifera is not endemic, but other species of Apis naturally occur (central and eastern Asia), 3) regions where Apis species are not endemic (America, Australia). Although some studies show an impact on native bee survival, fecundity, or population density in response to large A. mellifera aggregations (e.g., on apiaries), there are no reports that feral honeybees caused the extinction of native bee pollinators, which are the most likely competing group of organisms. Honeybee introductions have had or still may have negative effects only within the genus Apis, primarily interfering with beekeeping activities. Although honeybee invasions seem to have had little if any effect on biodiversity of native pollinators so far, we nevertheless caution against transporting honeybees around the globe, and we particularly advise against importing foreign Apis species into tropical ecosystems.","2005","2022-11-02 15:42:25","2022-11-02T15:42:25Z",NA,"289–301","","3",12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Their effect on scarce, endangered or stenotopic species and on the diversity of invertebrate species assemblages which depend on a mosaic of successional habitat stages, is controversially discussed. In southern Switzerland, in a region affected by regular winter fires, we investigated the effect of the fire frequency on a large spectrum of taxonomic groups. We focussed on total biodiversity, taxonomic groups specific to certain habitat types, and on scarce and endangered species. Overall species richness was significantly higher in plots with repeated fires than in the unburnt control sites. Plots with only one fire in the last 30 yr harboured intermediate species numbers. Fire frequency had a significantly positive effect on species richness of the guilds of interior forest species and forest edge specialists. Species of open landscape, open forests and interior forests were not influenced by fire frequency. A positive effect of fire on species richness was observed for ground beetles (Carabidae), hoverflies (Syrphidae), bees and wasps (Hymenoptera aculeata, without Formicidae), and spiders (Araneae). True bugs (Heteroptera), lacewings (Neuroptera) and the saproxylic beetle fami- lies Cerambycidae, Buprestidae and Lucanidae showed positive trends, but no statistically significant effects of fire on species numbers or/and abundances. Negative effects of fire on species numbers or/and abundances were found only for isopods and weevils (Curculionidae). A compromise for forest management is suggested, which considers the risk of damage by fire to people and goods, while avoiding the risk of damage to biodiversity by imitating the effects of sporadic fires and providing a mosaic forest with open gaps of different successional stages.","2014","2022-11-02 15:42:20","2022-11-02T15:42:20Z",NA,"173–186","","2",27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the continental scale, niche-based models have been widely used in the last 10 years to predict the potential impacts of climate change on species distributions all over the world, although these models do not include any mechanistic relationships. In contrast, species-specific, process-based predictions remain scarce at the continental scale. This is regrettable because to secure relevant and accurate predictions it is always desirable to compare predictions derived from different kinds of models applied independently to the same set of species and using the same raw data. Here we compare predictions of range shifts under climate change scenarios for 2100 derived from niche-based models with those of a process-based model for 15 North American boreal and temperate tree species. A general pattern emerged from our comparisons: niche-based models tend to predict a stronger level of extinction and a greater proportion of colonization than the process-based model. This result likely arises because niche-based models do not take phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation into account. Nevertheless, as the two kinds of models rely on different assumptions, their complementarity is revealed by common findings. Both modeling approaches highlight a major potential limitation on species tracking their climatic niche because of migration constraints and identify similar zones where species extirpation is likely. Such convergent predictions from models built on very different principles provide a useful way to offset uncertainties at the continental scale. This study shows that the use in concert of both approaches with their own caveats and advantages is crucial to obtain more robust results and that comparisons among models are needed in the near future to gain accuracy regarding predictions of range shifts under climate change.","2009","2022-11-02 15:42:18","2022-11-02T15:42:18Z",NA,"1301–13","","5",90,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19537550",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date research in this area has focused on how invasive plant species affect pollinator behaviour, but there is a lack of data on the impact that alien plant species have on wild pollinator populations. Since their introduction in the 19th century, and rapid spread after the 1950s, alien goldenrods (Solidago canadensis, Solidago gigantea) have been among the most successful invasive plant species in Europe. We studied the effects of goldenrods on wild pollinator communities in SE Poland. The abundance, species richness and diversity of wild bees, hoverflies and butterflies were compared between wet meadows invaded by goldenrod (10 transects) and non-invaded controls (10 transects). Furthermore, we compared the plant diversity and average cover between the two groups of sites. Invasion of goldenrods had a very strong negative effect on wild pollinator diversity as well as abundance. Plant diversity and average cover were also negatively affected by goldenrod invasion. Wild pollinators were grouped according to their nesting and food specialization, but none were resistant to the invasion, indicating that introduced goldenrod may affect the entire wild pollinator community. Our study emphasises the urgent need to develop specific protection plans for wild pollinators in habitats threatened by foreign plants and we call for the introduction of programs to stop the invasion of goldenrod not only in Poland, but also on a continental scale. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the impact of heavy metal pollution on the wild bee Osmia rufa (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) by comparing their survival, reproduction and population dynamics along two independent gradients of heavy metal pol- lution, one in Poland and the other in the United Kingdom. We used trap nests to evaluate the response of fitness and survival parameters of O. rufa. To quan- tify the levels of pollution, we directly measured the heavy metal concentration in provisions collected by O. rufa. 3. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration, there was a steady decrease in number of brood cells constructed by females and an increase in the proportion of dead offspring. In the most polluted site, there were typi- cally 3–4 cells per female with 50–60% dead offspring, whereas in unpolluted sites there were 8 to 10 cells per female and only 10–30% dead offspring. More- over, the bee population growth rate (R0) decreased along the heavy metal pol- lution gradients.

Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored.

A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007-08 growing seasons. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.","2010","2022-11-02 15:42:03","2022-11-02T15:42:03Z",NA,"e9754","","3",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 20333298",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been shown that garden management regime (water use, floral composition) may impact the species they shelter. However, due to access restrictions, lack of regulations and the difficulty of data collection on private property, the impact of management practices and in particular pesticide use has seldom been assessed in private gardens. Using data collected in the framework of a nationwide participatory monitoring scheme in France, we assess here, for the first time, the effect of private garden management on two important groups of flower-visiting insects, i.e. butterflies and bumblebees, at a large scale. We show that the correlation between butterfly and bumblebee abundance and use of insecticides and herbicides is negative, whereas the use of Bordeaux mixture (fungicide approved for organic use), fungicides and anti-slugs is positively correlated with butterfly and bumblebee abundance. We hypothesize that herbicides have an indirect negative impact on insects by limiting the amount of available resources, and that the Bordeaux mixture, fungicides and slug repellants have an indirect positive impact on these insects by fostering healthier plants, probably offering higher level of resources to pollinators. Moreover, we show that the impact of pesticides varies according to the landscape, the negative effect of insecticides being more important in highly urbanized areas. Overall, our results show that gardener practices can have a positive impact on flower-visiting insects, even in a highly anthropized, urban landscape.","2015","2022-11-02 15:42:01","2022-11-02T15:42:01Z",NA,"148–154","","",182,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Citizen science; Fungicide; Herbicide; Insecticide; Pollinators; Urbanization","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2. km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10. km. We suggest implementing measures that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2013","2022-11-02 15:41:59","2022-11-02T15:41:59Z",NA,"269–276","","",159,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apicystis; Bombus; Crithidia; Locustacarus; Nosema; Parasite","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this article, we discuss extending the conventional pairwise concept and demonstrate a community module-based approach as an initial step for exploring community consequences of species-specific phenological shifts caused by climate change. Our multispecies match/mismatch perspective leads to the prediction that phenological (a)synchrony among interacting species critically affects not only population recruitment of species but also key dynamical features of ecological communities such as trophic cascades, competitive hierarchies, and species coexistence. Explicit identification and consideration of species relationships is therefore desirable for a better understanding of seasonal community dynamics and thus community consequences of climate change-induced phenological shifts.","2012","2022-11-02 15:41:56","2022-11-02T15:41:56Z",NA,"489–495","","4",121,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In 2007, the 11th year of commercial production, Bt maize and Bt cotton were commercially produced on a total of ∼42 million hectares in 20 countries. Assessment of environmental safety has been and continues to be a key element of transgenic crop technology. This review focuses on two environmental elements, effects on non-target invertebrates and changes in insecticide use patterns since the adoption of Bt maize and cotton. Meta-analyses of the extant literature on invertebrate non-target effects reveals that the pattern and extent of impact varies in relation to taxonomy, ecological or anthropomorphic guild, route of exposure and the non-Bt control against which effects are gauged. Hazards identified in the laboratory may not always manifest in the field and the minor negative effects of Bt crops demonstrated in the field pale in comparison with alternative pest suppression measures based on insecticides. The efficacy of Bt maize and cotton against major pest species has been associated with an estimated 136.6 million kg global reduction in insecticide active ingredient used between 1996 and 2006 (29.9% reduction). Benefits vary by country and region and are heavily weighted towards cotton production, which has historically been one of the largest users of insecticides in the world.","2009","2022-11-02 15:41:50","2022-11-02T15:41:50Z",NA,"","","011",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such biases are most obvious when animals are confronted with exaggerated versions of signals they normally encounter. Signalling systems operating in plant-pollinator interactions are among the most highly coevolved, with plants using a variety of floral signals to attract pollinators. A number of observations suggest that pollinators preferentially visit larger floral displays although the benefit of this to either the plant or the pollinator is not always clear. We use a standard dual-choice experimental protocol to show that honeybees display a receiver bias for exaggerated size and colour contrast–two important components of floral signals–even when such signals do not indicate quality. We discuss the implications of this receiver bias for the evolution of floral displays and its possible exploitation by invading alien plants.","2007","2022-11-02 15:41:47","2022-11-02T15:41:47Z",NA,"635–637","","6",3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Exaggerated signals; Floral displays; Honeybees; Pattern discrimination; Pollinators; Receiver bias","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent descriptive studies suggest that colony losses are often related to the interaction between pathogens and other stress factors, including parasites. Through an integrated analysis of the population and molecular changes associated with the collapse of honeybee colonies infested by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, we show that this parasite can de-stabilise the within-host dynamics of Deformed wing virus (DWV), transforming a cryptic and vertically transmitted virus into a rapidly replicating killer, which attains lethal levels late in the season. The de-stabilisation of DWV infection is associated with an immunosuppression syndrome, characterized by a strong down-regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB. The centrality of NF-κB in host responses to a range of environmental challenges suggests that this transcription factor can act as a common currency underlying colony collapse that may be triggered by different causes. Our results offer an integrated account for the multifactorial origin of honeybee losses and a new framework for assessing, and possibly mitigating, the impact of environmental challenges on honeybee health.","2012","2022-11-02 15:41:45","2022-11-02T15:41:45Z",NA,"","","6",8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sampled pollinators in 19 fragments ranging from 0.3 to 31 ha and surrounded by a variety of land-use types, including forest, low-density suburban, and urban neighbourhoods. Pan-trapping and netting surveys captured 4464 bees, flies, and wasps in 138 species and 48 genera. 3.Contrary to expectations, overall species richness did not increase with fragment size. However, ground-nester abundance (not diversity) and cavity-nester diversity (not abundance) were higher in larger fragments, as expected. Floral richness and abundance did not foster pollinator diversity for either guild. Brood parasite responses were complex: host availability (ground-nesting bees) was generally important, richness and abundance increased in fragments with high surrounding road density, and abundance also increased in fragments with other habitat fragments nearby. 4.Responses of different nesting guilds to fragmentation may be related to their use of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments. Some common cavity nesters can nest in fences and gardens, but urban land use may be less hospitable for ground nesters. Brood parasites apparently respond both to host availability and landscape characteristics associated with movement among fragments. 5.Consideration of nesting requirements of pollinators provided some insight into their response to habitat loss in our analysis and should be considered in future studies of fragmentation impacts on pollinator biodiversity.","2013","2022-11-02 15:41:38","2022-11-02T15:41:38Z",NA,"57–66","","1",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bees; Biodiversity; Habitat fragmentation; Nesting guilds; Oak-savannah ecosystem; Pollination","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article reviews the available literature focusing on the effects of urbanization on flowering phenology. The literature of flowering phenology in urban environments suggests that spring-blooming plants in a variety of ecosystems in North America, Europe, and China tend to bloom earlier in the city than in the surrounding un-urbanized habitat. Moreover, ephemerals, early spring bloomers, and insect-pollinated plants in these environments tend to be more sensitive than perennials, mid- or late-spring bloomers, and wind-pollinated plants. Researchers attribute advanced flowering in urban environments to the Heat Island Effect. The potential ecological consequences of changes in flowering phenology in urbanized areas are not well understood or explicitly studied. However, studies in global biology have suggested that climate change may result in a series of important ecological consequences as well as human-related problems such as earlier and extended allergy seasons.

In contrast, the beetles can be harmful parasites of European honeybee subspecies. Resistance of African subspecies to infestations is probably due to quantitative differences in a series of behaviours such as absconding, aggression, removal of parasite eggs and larvae and social encapsulation. The beetles use counter-resistance tactics such as defence posture, dropping, hiding, escape, egg laying in small gaps and trophallactic mimicry. Small hive beetles are efficient in long-range transportation (US: 1996, Australia: 2002) and can establish populations in temperate regions due to their overwintering capacity in honeybee clusters. Host shifts to other bee species may also occur. Thus, small hive beetles have the potential to become a global threat to apiculture and wild bee populations.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential impact of maize grown from imidacloprid-treated seeds on honey bee mortality. A survey of 16 apiaries was carried out, and all maize fields treated or not with imidacloprid were located within a radius of 3,000 m around the observed apiaries. Samples of honey, beeswax, and bees were collected in three colonies per apiary and analyzed for pesticide contain by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We first found a significant correlation between the number of colonies per apiary and the mortality rates in an apiary. In addition, this mortality rate was inversely correlated with the surface of maize fields treated and not with imidacloprid, suggesting that this pesticide do not interact with bees' fitness. Moreover, a very large number of our samples contained acaricides either prohibited or ineffective against Varroa destructor (Anderson & Trueman) (Acari: Varroidae), suggesting that the treatment methods used by the beekeepers to be inadequate for mite control.

At the same time, the species position within food webs or mutualistic networks (e.g. generalist or specialist, network hub or peripheral vertex) may affect their ability to persist after perturbations. This study was conducted in a heavily managed boreal forest landscape in southeastern Norway, using study plots situated in forest stands with contrasting disturbance history: old growth forest (least disturbed), young forest (intermediate) and clear cuts (most disturbed). By studying 12 pollination networks with contrasting disturbance history we found that important network descriptors were conserved after perturbation. Link-diversity was higher, both overall and per site, in the more disturbed communities while link-turnover was highest in the least disturbed community. We conclude that despite an increase in diversity in the more degraded habitat, the higher link-turnover in the least degraded, old growth forest, community indicates a homogenization of the plant-pollinator networks as a result of habitat degradation. Finally, we found that the degree (number of interacting partners) and network functional role for particular species changed along the disturbance gradient, though not in any systematic way. We conclude that structural properties of the pollination network are conserved after perturbations, but that particular species' network functional roles may change. © 2013 The Authors.","2014","2022-11-02 15:41:27","2022-11-02T15:41:27Z",NA,"323–333","","3",123,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been suggested that metal pollution is one potentially very important reason for the decline. Recently, a recovery of P. apollo and widening of its range has started in the southwestern Finland, simultaneously with a decline in metal fallout from air. Metal analyses were performed with larval and host plant samples collected from an area where P. apollo is recolonising its former range (the archipelago between the island of KemiÃ\P and the Hankoniemi peninsula). In the host plants (Sedum telephium), the level of Fe was significantly lower and the levels of Cd and Zn suggestively lower in the current range (n = 35) of P. apollo than in the former range (n = 12). Analyses on larvae of P. apollo (n = 29) showed lower levels of Cd, Fe and Mn than in the host plant leaves. The excretion of these metals, as well as Zn, via the faeces was effective. The level of the Cd-antagonist Cu was considerably higher in caterpillars than in the food. When caterpillars were fed with metal-polluted food from Helsinki city (4.35 ppm Cd/dwt; n = 5) they died, whereas control individuals fed with food from the archipelago (2.49 ppm Cd/dwt; n = 5) survived. These results indicate that metals may play an important role in the large-scale decline and partial recovery of P. apollo in the western Europe.

Roadside verges in the Netherlands span approximately 80,000 km and are often covered with semi-natural grasslands. As such, they also provide a suitable habitat for many insects, but this has received little attention so far. We investigated the effects of different management treatments on flower-visiting insects. We studied flower visitation in a 3 years old experimental set-up with five mowing treatments each replicated five times. Management types were: no management and mowing once or twice per year with and without the removal of hay, representing common forms of management and neglect. During an entire growing season, both flowers (number of species and inflorescences) as well as insects (total abundance and actual flower visits) were investigated. Mowing twice per year with removal of hay showed highest values for all measured variables and this effect persisted throughout the growing season. The early summer cut proved to be very important for insect feeding opportunities, due to the re-flowering of plants later in the growing season. Flower abundance showed high correlations with both plant species richness and the number of insect visits. Although overall, mowing twice a year with hay removal was the most beneficial treatment for flower-visiting insects, these plots were entirely devoid of flowers for some period right after mowing, indicating that a rotational scheme might further promote insect diversity and abundance. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This review article presents the state of the art of the phenomenon of dust emission and drift from pesticide seed dressing during sowing and its consequences. Firstly, pesticide seed treatment is defined and its pros and cons are set out, with the focus on dust, dust emission and dust drift from pesticide-coated seed. The factors affecting emission of pesticide dust (e.g. seed treatment quality, seed drilling technology and environmental conditions) are considered, along with its possible effects. The measuring techniques and protocols and models currently in use for calculating the behaviour of dust are reviewed, together with their features and limitations. Finally, possible mitigation measures are discussed, such as improving the seed quality and the use of modified seed drilling technology, and an overview of regulations and stewardship activities is given.","2013","2022-11-02 15:41:13","2022-11-02T15:41:13Z",NA,"564–575","","5",69,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Crop protection; Dust drift; Mitigation; Modelling; Neonicotinoids; Seed coating; Seed treatment","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the risk to monarch butterfly larvae from most varieties of Bt maize proved to be negligible, one variety (Event 176) posed a significant threat to monarchs. Since this variety was registered and commercialized without complete understanding of its potential risk to a non-target species, we suggest several ways pre-commercialization regulation and ecological risk assessment might be improved, with the hope of preventing future negative impacts to non-targets. Among our recommendations: make the pre-commercialization risk assessment broadly accessible, independent, and focused on the unique ecological context for the proposed transgenic crop; increase funding for independent non-target risk assessments; and establish a product registration regime that is based on the best available science and responsive to uncertain science.","2003","2022-11-02 15:41:11","2022-11-02T15:41:11Z",NA,"1–7","","",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agriculture; Bacillus thuringiensis; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Danaus plexippus; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; FF005Field Crops (NEW March 2000); FF020Plant Breeding and Genetics; FF620Plant Pests (NEW March 2000); Genetics & Heredity; HH600Host Resistance and Immunity; Physiology (provided by Thomson Reuters); Plant Sciences; WW100No Code; Zea mays; biosafety; gene flow; genetic engineering; genetic transformation; genetically engineered organisms; maize; nontarget effects; pest resistance; plants; risk; transgenic plants","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we examine the effects of grassland fragmentation and land use in the landscape matrix (on a 2 km scale) on species richness of plants, butterflies, bees and hoverflies. These organisms were studied in replicated remnant patches of different sizes and isolation, embedded in landscapes dominated either by forest, arable land or a mix of these. We found positive effects of patch area on species richness of the three insect taxa, but not of plants. Isolation had a negative effect only on hoverflies. Matrix type had contrasting effects on the studied taxa. Species richness of plants and butterflies was lowest in patches in landscapes dominated by arable land and highest in forest-dominated landscapes. For hoverflies, the negative effect of small patch area was strongest in forest-dominated landscapes, and there was a similar non-significant trend for bees. Our study shows the importance of considering matrix characteristics when studying responses to habitat fragmentation. Differences in matrix response among organism groups probably impinge on differing mechanisms. A forest matrix is likely to provide additional resources for butterflies but either constitute a barrier to dispersal or deprive resources as compared to an arable matrix for hoverflies. Enhanced plant diversity in grassland patches embedded in forested landscapes can be explained by habitat generalists more easily invading these patches, or by an unpaid extinction debt in these landscapes.","2012","2022-11-02 15:41:09","2022-11-02T15:41:09Z",NA,"259–267","","3",35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Crop losses due to these harmful organisms can be substantial and may be prevented, or reduced, by crop protection measures. An overview is given on different types of crop losses as well as on various methods of pest control developed during the last century.Estimates on potential and actual losses despite the current crop protection practices are given for wheat, rice, maize, potatoes, soybeans, and cotton for the period 2001–03 on a regional basis (19 regions) as well as for the global total. Among crops, the total global potential loss due to pests varied from about 50% in wheat to more than 80% in cotton production. The responses are estimated as losses of 26–29% for soybean, wheat and cotton, and 31, 37 and 40% for maize, rice and potatoes, respectively. Overall, weeds produced the highest potential loss (34%), with animal pests and pathogens being less important (losses of 18 and 16%). The efficacy of crop protection was higher in cash crops than in food crops. Weed control can be managed mechanically or chemically, therefore worldwide efficacy was considerably higher than for the control of animal pests or diseases, which rely heavily on synthetic chemicals. Regional differences in efficacy are outlined. Despite a clear increase in pesticide use, crop losses have not significantly decreased during the last 40 years. However, pesticide use has enabled farmers to modify production systems and to increase crop productivity without sustaining the higher losses likely to occur from an increased susceptibility to the damaging effect of pests.The concept of integrated pest/crop management includes a threshold concept for the application of pest control measures and reduction in the amount/frequency of pesticides applied to an economically and ecologically acceptable level. Often minor crop losses are economically acceptable; however, an increase in crop productivity without adequate crop protection does not make sense, because an increase in attainable yields is often associated with an increased vulnerability to damage inflicted by pests.","2006-02","2022-11-02 15:41:07","2022-11-02T15:41:07Z",NA,"31–43","","1",144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 16714311",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Biofortified crop; Biotechnology; Bt corn; GM food crop; Golden Rice; disease; pests","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The OA receptors have been studied as targets of classical amidine acaricide/insecticides, even though these GPCRs are not well understood at the molecular level; however, new discoveries have recently provided more information regarding these GPCRs.

For thes","Science","","","10.1126/science.1257259","","Pollinators are fundamental to maintaining both biodiversity and agricultural productivity, but habitat destruction, loss of flower resources, and increased use of pesticides are causing declines in their abundance and diversity. Using historical records, we assessed the rate of extinction of bee and flower-visiting wasp species in Britain from the mid-19th century to the present. The most rapid phase of extinction appears to be related to changes in agricultural policy and practice beginning in the 1920s, before the agricultural intensification prompted by the Second World War, often cited as the most important driver of biodiversity loss in Britain. Slowing of the extinction rate from the 1960s onward may be due to prior loss of the most sensitive species and/or effective conservation programs. P ollinating insects, particularly bees and other flower-visiting Hymenoptera (Aculeata), are some of the most ecologically and economically important insects (1–3) but have declined in species richness, ge-ographical range, and abundance (2–5). Previous studies have assessed the roles played by habitat destruction and loss of flower resources (4, 5), as well as pesticides (6), over relatively modest time scales and geographical ranges. Analyses of regions are rare (7–10), and our understanding of the effects of human-mediated actions over longer periods is limited. Here we assess the bee and flower-visiting wasp species that have gone extinct in Britain, using 494,117 records held by the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS), probably the most detailed available for a single country. We define extinct species as those that have not been recorded for at least 20 years after their last observation, despite ex-tensive efforts by members of BWARS and other naturalists. Twenty-three bee and flower-visiting wasp species have become extinct in Britain (Table 1), including formerly widespread species. We ex-clude single early records that cannot be verified as representing stable breeding populations, but we include one species that has recolonized Britain after an absence of six decades (see ma-terials and methods and other supplementary materials). Since the mid-19th century, the pattern of British bee and wasp extinctions has been char-acterized by intervals of relative stability in which few species were lost, interspersed with times when more than three species per decade went extinct (Fig. 1 and Table 2). These data indicate a period of relatively sustained extinctions from the late 1920s to the late 1950s, with other iso-lated extinction peaks before and after this time.

A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with \textgreater150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with \textless50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15% of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.","2007","2022-11-02 15:41:01","2022-11-02T15:41:01Z",NA,"19891–19896","","50",104,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the contributions and spatial scales at which these drivers operate and interact are not fully understood, particularly in the developing world. The impact of both local management and landscape context on insect pollinators and natural enemy communities and on their capacity to deliver related ecosystem services to an economically important tropical crop, pigeonpea was investigated. The study was conducted in nine paired farms across a gradient of increasing distance to semi-native vegetation in Kibwezi, Kenya. Results show that proximity of fields to semi-native habitats negatively affected pollinator and chewing insect abundance. Within fields, pesticide use was a key negative predictor of pollinator, pest and foliar active predator abundance. On the contrary, fertilizer application significantly enhanced pollinator and both chewing and sucking insect pest abundance. At a 1. km spatial scale of fields, there were significant negative effects of the number of semi-native habitat patches within fields dominated by mass flowering pigeonpea on pollinators abundance. For service provision, a significant decline in fruit set when insects were excluded from flowers was recorded. This study reveals the interconnections of pollinators, predators and pests with pigeonpea crop. For sustainable yields and to conserve high densities of both pollinators and predators of pests within pigeonpea landscapes, it is crucial to target the adoption of less disruptive farm management practices such as reducing pesticide and fertilizer inputs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2011","2022-11-02 15:40:32","2022-11-02T15:40:32Z",NA,"2424–2431","","10",144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bio-control; Farm management; Fruit set; Landscape context; Pollination; The developing world","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date its pathology and impact on host fitness are not well understood. We performed a laboratory experiment investigating the pathology and fitness effects of this parasite on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We experimentally infected one group of colonies with N. bombi spores at the start of the worker production, while a second uninfected group of colonies served as controls. During colony development we collected live workers for dissections to measure infection intensities. In parallel, we measured several life history traits, to investigate costs to the host. We succeeded in infecting 11 of 16 experimental colonies. When infection occurred at an early stage of colony development, virtually all individuals were infected, with spores being found in a number of tissues, and the functional fitness of males and young queens was reduced to zero. Further, the survival of workers from infected colonies and infected males were reduced. With such severe effects, N. bombi appears to decrease its opportunities for transmission to the next host generation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

There was no tendency for taxa with restricted geographical ranges to be particularly sensitive to selective logging.

The apparent similarity of the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage in selectively logged and unlogged forest contrasts with previous studies of butterfly assemblages but mirrors results for birds in the same plots. A possible explanation is the high frequency of natural disturbance-hurricanes and associatedfires-in the Chiquibul Forest. The species present appear to be adapted to naturally disturbed habitats and may therefore be relatively unaffected by selective logging.

Because of their more restricted range of host plants, it maybe expected that specialists exist in smaller, more isolated populations, with lower effective population sizes than generalists. Consequently, we hypothesized that oligolectic bees have reduced levels of genetic variation relative to related polylectic species. To test this hypothesis, we used five phylogenetically independent pairs of species in which one member was oligolectic and the other was polylectic. We assayed genetic variation in our species pairs at an average of 32 allozyme loci. Within each species pair, the oligolectic member had fewer polymorphic loci, lower average allelic richness, and lower average expected heterozygosity than its polylectic relative. Averaged over all species pairs, this corresponds to a 21% reduction in allelic richness, a 72% reduction in the proportion of polymorphic loci, and an 83% reduction in expected heterozygosity in specialists compared with generalists. Our data support the hypothesis of reduced effective population size in oligolectic bees and suggest that they may be more prone to extinction as a result.

To minimize global biodiversity losses, conservationists need to identify those species that are likely to be most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In this Review, we summarize different currencies used for assessing species' climate change vulnerability. We describe three main approaches used to derive these currencies (correlative, mechanistic and trait-based), and their associated data requirements, spatial and temporal scales of application and modelling methods. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and highlight the sources of uncertainty inherent in each method that limit projection reliability. Finally, we provide guidance for conservation practitioners in selecting the most appropriate approach(es) for their planning needs and highlight priority areas for further assessments.","2015","2022-11-02 15:40:12","2022-11-02T15:40:12Z",NA,"215–225","","3",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23347591",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) is an example of a species that can compete with native bees for floral resources. Often, research into honey bee/native bee competition has focused on floral resource overlap, visitation rates or resource harvesting, and any negative interaction has been interpreted as a negative impact. Although this research can be valuable in indicating the potential for competition between honey bees and native bees, to determine if the long-term survival of a native bee species is threatened, fecundity, survival or population density needs to be assessed. The present review evaluates research that has investigated all these measurements of honey bee/native bee competition and finds that many studies have problems with sample size, confounding factors or data interpretation. Guidelines for future research include increasing replication and using long-term studies to investigate the impact of both commercial and feral honey bees.","2004","2022-11-02 15:40:10","2022-11-02T15:40:10Z",NA,"399–407","","4",29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Competition; Honey bee; Native bee; Resource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paradigm has been established in large measure because more bees are often found in areas supporting greater floral abundance. This could result from attraction to resource-rich sites as well as greater local demographic performance in sites supporting high floral abundance; however, demographic performance is usually unknown. Factors other than floral resources such as availability of nest sites, pressure from natural enemies, or whether floral resources are from a mixed native or mostly monodominant exotic assemblage might influence survival or fecundity and hence abundance. We examined how the survival and fecundity of the native solitary bee Osmia lignaria varied along a gradient in floral resource abundance. We released bees alongside a nest block at 27 grassland sites in Montana (USA) that varied in floral abundance and the extent of invasion by exotic forbs. We monitored nest construction and the fate of offspring within each nest. The number of nests established was positively related to native forb abundance and was negatively related to exotic forb species richness. Fecundity was positively related to native forb species richness; however, offspring mortality caused by the brood parasite Tricrania stansburyi was significantly greater in native-dominated sites. These results suggest that native floral resources can positively influence bee populations, but that the relationship between native floral resources and bee population performance is not straightforward. Rather, bees may face a trade-off between high offspring production and low offspring survival in native-dominated sites.","2014","2022-11-02 15:40:08","2022-11-02T15:40:08Z",NA,"789–798","","3",176,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Exotic plants; Osmia lignaria; Pollinators; Resource limitation; Tricrania stansburyi","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Numbers of butterflies in beet and spring oilseed rape and of Heteroptera and bees in beet were smaller under the relevant GMHT crop management, whereas the abundance of Collembola was consistently greater in all GMHT crops. Generally, these effects were specific to each crop type, reflected the phenology and ecology of the arthropod taxa, were indirect and related to herbicide management. These results apply generally to agriculture across Britain, and could be used in mathematical models to predict the possible long-term effects of the widespread adoption of GMHT technology. The results for bees and butterflies relate to foraging preferences and might or might not translate into effects on population densities, depending on whether adoption leads to forage reductions over large areas.

Many processes occur in soils. These include the recycling of nutrients from previous crop residues to maintain primary production, and the consequent introduction of the sun's energy into the biosphere. Other processes that enhance environmental quality such as the suppression of plant pathogens, carbon sequestration and bioremediation also occur. Soils support one of the most diverse ecosystems in the biosphere, with a population consisting of many thousands of species of bacteria, protozoa, fungi and micro-, meso-and macro-fauna, which are responsible for a large number of functional processes. The soil population varies greatly in types, numbers and functional expression both temporally and spatially, and is responsive to a variety of inputs and physical conditions. These are dynamic systems that are constantly evolving and changing, in which many components are intrinsically interconnected, and conversely others are completely autonomous. Plant inputs are the major drivers of soil ecosystem functioning, and responses to these inputs vary according to both the quantity of these inputs and the constituent chemicals. These inputs come from roots, root exudates and debris, and residues from the aerial parts during active plant growth and from senescing material after the plant dies. They provide energy from the breakdown of the carbon fixed during primary production in the plant, and frequently, although consequentially, nitrogen, in many forms. Inputs differ in both amounts and types of compounds according to plant species. Hence, different plants can have differing effects on soil process dynamics. Soil organisms are also involved in other nutrient acquisitions such as phosphorous mobilization and metal chelation to enable plant uptake, as well as mycorrhizal associations. Their activities also impact on soil health and quality, with subsequent impacts on water quality and supply. Without these soil-ecosystem-driven phenomena primary production would cease. Here the possible impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops on agricultural and natural systems are considered. However, it should be borne in mind that all the topics considered will apply equally to the introduction of new, or indeed different, cultivars or crops, since it is the consequences of changed inputs from these that are relevant. Similarly, many changes in agronomic practice, such as cultivation technique and timing, planting and sowing rates, pesticide usage, etc., must also be considered. The environmental impacts of these should receive equal attention as these large perturbations that are routinely applied to soil ecosystems during normal agricultural management practices have significant impacts on soil communities and functions (Buckley and Schmidt, 2001). These and other factors such as plant type being cultivated, season, climate and geography may well be much greater drivers of community structure in the rhizosphere than any changes in inputs resulting from GM of the crop plant (Donegan et al., 1999; Griffiths et al., 2000; Lukow et al., 2000; Dunfield and Germida, 2001; Hopkins et al., 2001).

The process continues with a series of studies on the developmental biology, pollinating efficacy, nesting behaviour, preference for different nesting substrates, and population dynamics of the candidate pollinator. Parallel studies investigate the biology of parasites, predators and pathogens. The information gained in these studies is combined with information on the reproductive biology of the crop to design a management system. Complete management systems should provide guidelines on rearing and releasing methods, bee densities required for adequate pollination, nesting materials, and control against parasites, predators and pathogens. Management systems should also provide methods to ensure a reliable pollinator supply. Pilot tests on a commercial scale are then conducted to test and eventually refine the management system. The process culminates with the delivery of a viable system to manage and sustain the new pollinator on a commercial scale. The process is illustrated by the development of three mason bees, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski), O. lignaria Say and O. cornuta (Latreille) as orchard pollinators in Japan, the USA and Europe, respectively.","2002","2022-11-02 15:39:30","2022-11-02T15:39:30Z",NA,"3–16","","1",92,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Founder effects, hybridization, and adaptation to novel environments cause genetic differentiation between native and introduced populations and may contribute to the success of invaders. An influential idea in this context has been the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis. It proposes that after enemy release plants rapidly evolve to be less defended but more competitive, thereby increasing plant vigour in introduced populations. To detect evolutionary change in invaders, comparative studies of native versus introduced populations are needed. Here, we review the current empirical evidence from: (1) comparisons of phenotypic variation in natural populations; (2) comparisons of molecular variation with neutral genetic markers; (3) comparisons of quantitative genetic variation in a common environment; and (4) comparisons of phenotypic plasticity across different environments. Field data suggest that increased vigour and reduced herbivory are common in introduced plant populations. In molecular studies, the genetic diversity of introduced populations was not consistently different from that of native populations. Multiple introductions of invasive plants appear to be the rule rather than the exception. In tests of the EICA hypothesis in a common environment, several found increased growth or decreased resistance in introduced populations. However, few provided a full test of the EICA hypothesis by addressing growth and defence in the same species. Overall, there is reasonable empirical evidence to suggest that genetic differentiation through rapid evolutionary change is important in plant invasions. We discuss conceptual and methodological issues associated with cross-continental comparisons and make recommendations for future research. When testing for EICA, greater emphasis should be put on competitive ability and plant tolerance. Moreover, it is important to address evolutionary change in characteristics other than defence and growth that could play a role in plant invasions.","2005","2022-11-02 15:39:24","2022-11-02T15:39:24Z",NA,"1–11","","1",144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Biological invasions; Ecological genetics; Microevolution; Molecular markers; Phenotypic plasticity","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These pollination services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors, both social and economic. To better understand these different factors, we assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in Santander, Colombia. We quantified the effect of key ecological drivers on pollinator community composition, such as the method of farm management (either conventional or organic) and the surrounding landscape composition, specifically the proximity to forest. We found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the local pollinator fauna (open pollination) accounted for a 10.5 ? 2.0% increase in final coffee fruit set, and that the various pollinators are affected differently by the differing factors. For example, our findings indicate that conventional farm management, using synthetic inputs, can promote pollinators, especially if they are in close proximity to natural forest fragments. This is particularly true for stingless bees. Honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the conventional management of farms. Factors associated with greater numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover, lower tree densities, smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom, and younger coffee plantations. A forested landscape close to farms appears to enhance these factors, giving increased stability and resilience to the pollinating bees and insects. However we found that organic farms also support diverse pollinator communities, even if distant from forest fragments. The contribution of honeybees to pollination value (US$129.6/ha of coffee) is greater than that of stingless bees (US$16.5/ha of coffee). Since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers and types of pollinators attracted to farms, we have analysed the statistically significant social factors that influence farmers' decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices. These include the availability of technology, the type of landowner (whether married couples or individual owners), the number of years of farmers' formal education, the role of institutions, membership of community organizations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm. It is hoped that the use of our holistic approach, which combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers of pollination, will help provide evidence to underpin the development of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into sustainable agricultural practices. ã2015","2015","2022-11-02 15:39:19","2022-11-02T15:39:19Z",NA,"145–154","","",211,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Drivers of crop adoption; Ecosystem services; Farm management; Landscape context; Organic and conventional coffee farming; Pollinators; agroforestry systems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an intensively farmed area of Northeast Italy we investigated whether isolated organic farms, in a conventionally farmed landscape, provided local benefits for insect pollinators and pollination services. We quantified the relative effects of local management (i.e. the farm system), landscape management (proportion of surrounding uncultivated land) and interactions between them. We compared six organic and six conventional vine fields. The proportion of surrounding uncultivated land was calculated for each site at radii of 200, 500, 1000 and 2000. m. The organic fields did not differ from the conventional in their floral resources or proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. Data were collected on pollinator abundance and species richness, visitation rates to, and pollination of experimental potted plants. None of these factors were significantly affected by the farming system. The abundance of visits to the potted plants in the conventional fields tended to be negatively affected by the proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. The proportion fruit set, weight of seeds per plant and seed weight in conventional and organic fields were all negatively affected by the proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. In vine fields the impact of the surrounding landscape was stronger than the local management.

Because agricultural production reliant on pollination is growing, improving pollination effectiveness could increase crop yield without any increase in agricultural intensity or area. In California almond, a crop highly dependent on honey bee pollination, we explored the foraging behaviour and pollina-tion effectiveness of honey bees in orchards with simple (honey bee only) and diverse (non-Apis bees present) bee communities. In orchards with non-Apis bees, the foraging behaviour of honey bees changed and the polli-nation effectiveness of a single honey bee visit was greater than in orchards where non-Apis bees were absent. This change translated to a greater pro-portion of fruit set in these orchards. Our field experiments show that increased pollinator diversity can synergistically increase pollination service, through species interactions that alter the behaviour and resulting functional quality of a dominant pollinator species. These results of functional synergy between species were supported by an additional controlled cage exper-iment with Osmia lignaria and Apis mellifera.

I studied the responses of social stingless (or ""meliponine"") bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) to surrounding forest cover and floral resources in 35 sites in a largely deforested landscape in Costa Rica over three years, sampling bees with a standardized netting protocol. I recorded a diverse fauna of meliponines, comprised of 20 species and nine genera. I found that meliponine species richness and abundance are strongly related to forest cover, but not floral resource variables (blooming plant species richness and abundance). The effect of forest on meliponine abundance, but not diversity, disappeared when the most common meliponine species, Trigona fulviventris (which comprised ∼45% of sampled individuals), was excluded from analyses. Meliponine community composition, by contrast, was related most strongly to plant species richness, only weakly to forest cover, and not related to blooming plant abundance. This work differs from past work in the same landscape, which did not find evidence of changes in species richness or abundance of meliponines and forest-related variables (distance to forest or forest fragment size), but did find shifts toward meliponine-dominated communities near forests, especially larger ones. The larger true sample size (i.e. number of sample sites) of the present work likely improved the statistical power to detect these relationships. While meliponines are forest dependent, I recorded some species in the smallest forest fragments in the landscape, and as a group they respond strongly to overall forest cover in the landscape (i.e. including both small and large patches of forest). Both of these observations support arguments for preserving even small fragments of forest in agricultural landscapes. Given the ecological and economic importance of meliponine bees, it is imperative that we better understand their long-term conservation needs in the changing tropical landscapes of the world. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the impacts of neonicotinoid seed coatings in reducing subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and increasing crop yield are not known, despite the supposed benefits of this practice driving widespread use. Here, we combine large-scale pesticide usage and yield observations from oilseed rape with those detailing honey bee colony losses over an 11 year period, and reveal a correlation between honey bee colony losses and national-scale imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) usage patterns across England and Wales. We also provide the first evidence that farmers who use neonicotinoid seed coatings reduce the number of subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and may derive an economic return. Our results inform the societal discussion on the pollinator costs and farming benefits of prophylactic neonicotinoid usage on a mass flowering crop.","2015","2022-11-02 15:38:57","2022-11-02T15:38:57Z",NA,"12574","",NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nitrogen (N) limits primary productivity in many systems and can have dramatic effects on plant–herbivore interactions, but its effects on mutualistic interactions at the community level are not well-understood. The reproduction of many plants depends on both soilN and pollination, and N may affect floral traits, such as flower number or size, which are important for pollinator attraction to plant individuals and communities. 2. Thus, N may influence plant biomass and reproduction directly as well as indirectly via changes in pollination. The degree to which the effects of N enrichment scale from plant individuals to assemblages through emerging community-level changes in species interactions, like pollination, is relatively unknown. 3. For 4 years, we tested how N addition to subalpine plant assemblages in Colorado, USA, affected primary productivity and species diversity, floral traits and plant–pollinator interactions, and components of female and male plant reproduction. 4. At the community level, we found that high-N addition favoured the biomass and seed production of grasses, whereas low-N addition promoted forb growth, flower production and pollinator visitation. However, using a pollen supplementation experiment, we found no evidence thatNaddition altered patterns of pollen limitation of seed production. Pollinators distributed themselves evenly across floral resources such that per-flower visitation rate did not differ amongNtreatments. Thus, individual plants did not incur any extra benefit or cost from community-level changes in plant–pollinator interactions that resulted from N enrichment, and the effects of N on forb reproduction were direct. 5. Synthesis. Understanding how mutualistic and antagonistic species interactions influence individual and community responses to abiotic resources may provide insight to the dominant forces structuring communities and is especially important in the context of predicting the effects of environmental change. In this case, the direct effects of N addition on plants were stronger than the indirect effects mediated through plant–pollinator interactions, thus supporting the concept of bottom-up resource limitation controlling plant response.","2010","2022-11-02 15:38:51","2022-11-02T15:38:51Z",NA,"705–717","",3,98,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Indirect effects; Ipomopsis aggregata; Mutualism; Nutrient limitation; Potentilla pulcherrima; Species interactions","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They often count among the most species-rich habitats, especially in traditional cultural landscapes. Maintaining and/or restoring them is a top priority, but nevertheless represents a real conservation challenge, especially regarding their invertebrate assemblages. The main goal of this study was to experimentally investigate the influence of four different mowing regimes on orthopteran communities and populations: (1) control meadow (C-meadow): mowing regime according to the Swiss regulations for extensively managed meadows declared as ecological compensation areas, i.e. first cut not before 15 June; (2) first cut not before 15 July (delayed treatment, D-meadow); (3) first cut not before 15 June and second cut not earlier than 8 weeks from the first cut (8W-meadow); (4) refuges left uncut on 10-20% of the meadow area (R-meadow). Data were collected two years after the introduction of these mowing treatments. Orthopteran densities from spring to early summer were five times higher in D-meadows, compared to C-meadows. In R-meadows, densities were, on average, twice as high as in C-meadows, while mean species richness was 23% higher in R-meadows than in C-meadows. Provided that farmers were given the appropriate financial incentives, the D- and R-meadow regimes could be relatively easy to implement within agri-environment schemes. Such meadows could deliver substantial benefits for functional biodiversity, including sustenance to many secondary consumers dependent on field invertebrates as staple food. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","2013","2022-11-02 15:38:46","2022-11-02T15:38:46Z",NA,"22–30","",NA,181,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Biodiversity; Bush cricket; Conservation; Cutting; Grasshopper; Haying","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Garibaldi et al. (p. 1608, published online 28 February) now show that wild pollinators are also a vital part of our crop systems. In more than 40 important crops grown worldwide, wild pollinators improved pollination efficiency, increasing fruit set by twice that facilitated by honeybees. Burkle et al. (p. 1611, published online 28 February) took advantage of one of the most thorough and oldest data sets available on plant-pollinator interaction networks and recollected data on plant-pollinator interactions after more than 120 years of climate change and landscape alteration. The historical data set consists of observations collected by Charles Robertson near Carlinville, Illinois (USA), in the late 1800s on the phenology of plants and their pollinating insects, as well as information about which plants and pollinators interacted with one another. Many sites were revisited in the early 1970s and in 2009 and 2010 to collect similar plant-pollinator data. Pollinator function has declined through time, with bees showing lower visitation rates and lower fidelity to individual plant species.Using historic data sets, we quantified the degree to which global change over 120 years disrupted plant-pollinator interactions in a temperate forest understory community in Illinois, USA. We found degradation of interaction network structure and function and extirpation of 50% of bee species. Network changes can be attributed to shifts in forb and bee phenologies resulting in temporal mismatches, nonrandom species extinctions, and loss of spatial co-occurrences between extant species in modified landscapes. Quantity and quality of pollination services have declined through time. The historic network showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest that networks will be less resilient to future changes.","2013","2022-11-02 15:38:41","2022-11-02T15:38:41Z",NA,"1611 LP – 1615","",6127,339,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes, despite slower ocean warming.

Previous studies have compared the pollination values of different bee species solely by the speed with which they handle flowers and the proportion of visited flowers tripped. In this greenhouse study, five species of bees, including the three commercially managed U.S alfalfa pollinators, are likewise compared for their floral tripping frequencies. These bee species are also compared for the pod set and mature seed that results from their single visits to virgin flowers. Regardless of the identity of the pollinating bee, tripped flowers had the same probabilities of pod set and seed set. Thus, differences in the single-visit pollination efficiencies of the various bee species are entirely attributable to the proportion of visited flowers that they trip. Females of the alkali bee, Nomia melanderi Cockerell, and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F, tripped 81 and 78% of visited flowers, respectively. Males of these species are significantly less effective (61 and 51%, respectively), but still significantly superior to the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (22% of visited flowers tripped). These relationships are supported by field data for tripping frequencies. One candidate pollinator, Osmia sanrafaelae Parker, shows promise (44% tripped), but not the congeneric O. aglaia Sandhouse (13% tripped).","2009","2022-11-02 15:38:29","2022-11-02T15:38:29Z",NA,"22–27","",1,95,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Invasive flammable grasses, deforestation, historical fire suppression and human ignition are increasing fire frequency and intensifying its severity, as well as introducing fire to previously fireproof biomes. In many of these habitats, bees are key pollinators. Many, often most of the solitary bee species and individuals in these biomes nest underground (so-called "" mining"" bees). To evaluate their susceptibility to fire, we tested heat tolerances of bees' four life stages using an experimental design that mimicked heat conduction dynamics of natural soils. All life stages survived heating of up to 45. °C for 27. min, but none survived heating at 54. °C for 9. min; the pupal stage survived best. At near-lethal temperatures, more prolonged heating caused more mortality. These data were related to published studies of heat penetration depths in soil during fire and an exhaustive compilation of published nesting depths reported for mining bees. We conclude that a small fraction (9%) of the shallowest-nesting mining bee species is likely to die from soil heating by wildfire. Among these, ground-nesting megachilids (Osmia, Megachile) will be most vulnerable, owing to their shallow horizontal nests. Because mining bees prevail in most biomes of the temperate zone, any vegetation rehabilitation efforts should therefore expect that bee communities will largely survive the immediate effects of wildfire, and therefore will need pollen and nectar resources in the year(s) after fire. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2011","2022-11-02 15:38:26","2022-11-02T15:38:26Z",NA,"2631–2636","",11,144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apiformes; Apoidea; Fire; Pollinator","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, our general understanding of how phenology responds to climate change is based almost solely on incomplete assessments of phenology (such as first date of flowering) rather than on entire phenological distributions. Using a uniquely comprehensive 39-y flowering phenology dataset from the Colorado Rocky Mountains that contains more than 2 million flower counts, we reveal a diversity of species-level phenological shifts that bring into question the accuracy of previous estimates of long-term phenological change. For 60 species, we show that first, peak, and last flowering rarely shift uniformly and instead usually shift independently of one another, resulting in a diversity of phenological changes through time. Shifts in the timing of first flowering on average overestimate the magnitude of shifts in the timing of peak flowering, fail to predict shifts in the timing of last flowering, and underrepresent the number of species changing phenology in this plant community. Ultimately, this diversity of species-level phenological shifts contributes to altered coflowering patterns within the community, a redistribution of floral abundance across the season, and an expansion of the flowering season by more than I mo during the course of our study period. These results demonstrate the substantial reshaping of ecological communities that can be attributed to shifts in phenology.","2014","2022-11-02 15:38:21","2022-11-02T15:38:21Z",NA,"4916–4921","",13,111,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pressing environmental issues call into question the ability of the current model of industrial agriculture to sustain adequate yields without undermining the natural resource base upon which it depends. Meanwhile, global food needs are projected to double by 2050, raising questions over the need to further intensify agricultural production. Current research demonstrates that biologically diversified farming systems can meet global food needs sustainably and efficiently, as they outperform chemically managed monocultures across a wide range of globally important ecosystem services while producing sufficient yields and reducing resource waste throughout the food system. Research and development related to diversified systems, however, commands less than two percent of public agricultural research funding. We argue that this “knowledge gap” is at the crux of the “yield gap” that is often raised as the impediment to transitioning a greater share of global agriculture to diversified, agroecological production. If United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) research, education, and extension were to shift significantly toward agroecology and biologically diversified farming systems, the potential to address global resource challenges would be enormous. Here we present a broad framework for how the USDA could use existing infrastructure to address the challenges of food and farming in the twenty-first century and beyond.","2013","2022-11-02 15:38:14","2022-11-02T15:38:14Z",NA,"219–225","",NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research has documented the negative impacts of urbanization on the abundance and diversity of many groups of organisms. However, some organisms, such as bees, may benefit from moderate levels of development, depending on how development alters the availability of foraging and nesting resources. To determine how one type of low-intensity human development, suburbanization, affects bee abundance and diversity and the mechanisms involved, we surveyed bees across suburban and natural forests in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. We sampled for bees using a combination of bee bowls and hand-netting from March through July of 2008 and 2009. We found higher bee abundance in suburban than natural forests, and although observed species richness was greater in suburban than natural forests, there were no significant differences in rarefied richness or evenness estimates in either year. In addition, the effects of suburbanization were similar across bee species of varying ecological and life-history characteristics. At the local scale, bee abundance and species richness were both positively related to the abundance and richness of flowering species within forests, while the proportion of surrounding developed open areas, such as yards and roadsides, was a strong positive predictor of both bee abundance and richness at the landscape scale. These results suggest that open habitats and the availability of floral resources in suburban sites can support abundant and diverse bee communities and underscore the potential for native bee conservation in urban habitats. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.","2014","2022-11-02 15:38:12","2022-11-02T15:38:12Z",NA,"253–262","",2,43,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the summers before and after winter logging, bumble bees and plants were surveyed in 50 deciduous stands (each of 8–10 ha) in the boreal forest of northern Alberta, Canada. Logging was replicated at three different intensities: 0, 10–20, and 50–75% of trees remaining. There were generally more bumble bees, species of bumble bee-visited plants, and flowers in moderately (50–75%) logged sites, but this pattern depended on the time of year. Before logging, bumble bees matched resources according to an ideal free distribution (IFD). Logging affected the distribution of bumble bees across floral resources: the slope of the regression relating bumble bee and flower proportions was less than one for clearcut and control treatments (i.e., undermatching), with too many bumble bees in the flower-poor compartments and too few in the flower-rich ones. Deviations from an IFD were negative in control sites, such that fewer bumble bees occurred here than warranted by flower numbers. Controlling for flower density, bumble bee density was significantly greater in clearcuts than in the other treatments. By disproportionately visiting plants in clearcuts (relative to flower density), and by undermatching, bumble bees in clearcuts should experience higher levels of competition. Conversely, the fewer (and undermatching) bumble bees in control sites (relative to flower abundances there) may cause these plants to obtain diminished pollination service. The proximity of clearcut logging to pristine areas may therefore negatively impact plants and bumble bees in the pristine areas, at least in the season immediately following logging.","2005","2022-11-02 15:38:10","2022-11-02T15:38:10Z",NA,"1895–1907","",8,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Arthropods; Boreal forest; Bumble bees; Forestry; Ideal free distribution; Logging impacts; Selective logging; Undermatching","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the rise in demand for pollinator-dependent foods, such productivity losses may accelerate conversion of natural areas to cropland. Pollination-compensation measures involving managed pollinators or hand pollination are not always optimal or are too costly. Introducing areas of native vegetation within cropland has been proposed as a way to supplement crop pollinators, but this measure is perceived by farmers to carry costs outweighing benefits to agricultural production. Studies quantifying benefits of small patches of native flowers to crop pollination are therefore necessary to encourage such practices. To ascertain whether provision of floral resources within farmlands can facilitate pollination, and hence, crop yields, small experimental patches of perennial native plants (native flower compensation areas, NFCAs) were created in nonproductive areas of large commercial fields of several cultivars of mango Mangifera indica. Pesticide use and isolation from natural habitat were associated with declines in flying visitors and in mango production (kg of marketable fresh fruit), but presence of NFCAs ameliorated these declines, and NFCAs did not harbour any mango pests. In areas far from natural vegetation, orchards near NFCAs had significantly higher diversity and abundance of mango flying visitors, as well as mango production, than orchards far from NFCAs, although these measures were still lower than in orchards close to natural areas. Neither the most abundant flower visitors to mango (ants) nor initial fruit set was significantly affected by distance, pesticides or NFCAs, suggesting that although fertilization is associated with factors unaffected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticide use (i.e. self- and ant-pollination), viable fruit set (and ultimately, production) requires cross-pollination, for which flying visitors are essential. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the presence of small patches of native flowers within large farms can increase pollinator-dependent crop production if combined with preservation of remaining fragments of natural habitat and judicious use of pesticides. Native flower compensation areas represent a profitable management measure for farmers, increasing cost-effectiveness of cropland while indirectly contributing to preservation of natural habitat.

However, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect a global crisis for crop pollination. Understanding the extent to which world agriculture is endangered by pollinator decline is essential if the economic valuation of nature is to be used to promote conservation. We assess the susceptibility to pollinator limitation of one of the most important tropical and subtropical fruit crops, mango Mangifera indica L., commonly planted in a region of South Africa located between two large biodiversity-rich protected natural areas. We conducted flower visitor surveys, exclusion experiments and spatial analysis of flower visitation and fruit production patterns.3. Our results show that both ants and flower visitors were effective pollinators of mango, the latter significantly declining (in abundance and species richness) with distance to natural habitat while ants were not affected. Neither the absence of pesticides nor the supplementation of flower visitors by using managed honeybees served to offset these negative impacts. Food-web data suggest that maintaining diversity of flower resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator communities. Moreover, models based exclusively on pollinator abundance underestimated the negative effect of distance from natural habitat on production (42% less at 500 m from natural habitat). As soil nutrient levels and water content are regularly measured and corrected in all study sites, these results suggest that pollinator diversity may also be important. Synthesis and applications. This study provides one of the first examples of marked pollination limitation in farms surrounded by well-protected natural habitat. For mango farming to be sustainable, it is essential to limit contiguous growth of farmland and consider practices that restore the complexity of plant-pollinator networks within farms, for example through the creation and maintenance of pollinator-friendly areas. By highlighting the economic gains of adopting pollinator-friendly practices in agriculture, this work contributes to a growing body of studies that reveal that making farmland more suitable for pollinators benefits both agriculture and nature conservation. © 2010 The Authors.

Creating patches with high plant diversity within farmland is commonly suggested as a measure to benefit pollinators. However, farmers rarely adopt such practice, instead removing naturally occurring plants (weeds). By combining pollinator exclusion experiments with analysis of honeybee behaviour and flower-visitation webs, we found that the presence of weeds allowed pollinators to persist within sunflower fields, maximizing the benefits of the remaining patches of natural habitat to productivity of this large-scale crop. Weed diversity increased flower visitor diversity, hence ameliorating the measured negative effects of isolation from natural habitat. Although honeybees were the most abundant visitors, diversity of flower visitors enhanced honeybee movement, being the main factor influencing productivity. Conservation of natural patches combined with promoting flowering plants within crops can maximize productivity and, therefore, reduce the need for cropland expansion, contributing towards sustainable agriculture.","2011","2022-11-02 15:37:59","2022-11-02T15:37:59Z",NA,"251–259","",3,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To fill this gap, we compared the patterns of pollination and reproductive success in the invasive herb Echium vulgare (Boraginaceae) between monospecific patches (only E. vulgare) and mixed patches (sympatry with native herbs Schizanthus hookeri and Stachys albicaulis) in central Chile. Using sample quadrats of 1 m × 2 m, we quantified the richness, diversity and visitation rate of flower visitors in 15-min observation intervals. We conducted an assay to assess the effect of the patch types (monospecific and mixed) and the isolation of flowers to visitors on both the fruit set and seed/ovule ratio. We showed that native plants favoured the richness of visitors of E. vulgare; however, they did not lead to increases in visitation rate. The reproductive success of E. vulgare did not show differences between contrasted patches; however, the isolation of visitors decreased the fruit set, although seed production was maintained in the absence of pollinators, presumably by an autogamous mechanism. Complementary to our main research focus, we assessed changes in pollination variables and reproductive output in two coflowering native plants that occur with E. vulgare, S. hookeri and S. albicaulis. Despite the fact that our correlational study did not allow us to dissect the effects of mixed patches and relative plant abundances on variables measured for natives, we observed an increase in pollinator richness in mixed patches for the two plants studied. These results suggest a potential facilitation for visitor richness of the exotic plant in coexistence with native plants, although this facilitation does not result in changes in the visit rate or on the reproductive success of any of the studied species. This work underlines the need for additional research on community levels that assess reciprocal effects on pollination between coflowering natives and exotics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2013","2022-11-02 15:37:55","2022-11-02T15:37:55Z",NA,"475–484","",5,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bombus; Invasive species; Mediterranean biome; Native-exotic plant coexistence; Plant-pollinator; Pollinator diversity; Schizanthus hookeri; Stachys albicaulis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mean foraging distances were 755 m for Bombus lapidarius and 775 m for B. pascuorum (using our most conservative estimation method). Colony-specific foraging distances of both species varied with landscape structure, decreasing as the proportion of foraging habitats increased. This is the first time that foraging distance in wild bumblebees has been shown to vary with resource availability.

We quantified the relative value of native and long-established plant species as forage (nectar and pollen) resources for bumblebees by collating visitation data from 14 field sites across Britain. Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930-1969 to 1987-1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978-1998). Forage plants declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species. We consider how our findings relate to other recorded changes in the British flora, how they may help to explain declines in bumblebees and how they could contribute to a conservation strategy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The greenhouses were divided into three areas of 16 m2, and one of the following treatments was used for pollination: stingless bees (SB), mechanical vibration (MV), and no pollination (NP). Observations were conducted once a week from 0800 to 1600 hours during 2 mo. The acclimation of the bees to the greenhouses was estimated by the number of bees that did not return to the hive (lost bees) and by comparing the population of the colonies (brood and adults). The foraging activity of the bees across the day was evaluated by comparing the number of foragers per hour. The influence of environmental variables on the foraging activity was also analyzed. The pollination efficiency was compared among treatments through the percentage of fruit set, weight of individual fruit, kilograms of fruit produced per square meter, and the number of seed per fruit. The bees started foraging on the flowers approximately 7 d after the colonies were introduced to the greenhouse. There was a decline in the population of the colonies across the experiment, but colonies did not die out. Correlations of environmental variables with the foraging activity of the bees showed that none of them had a significant influence on pollen foraging. However, water collection was positively correlated with the temperature and negatively correlated with the humidity inside the greenhouse. The estimation of the pollination efficiency per treatment showed that there were significant differences in fruit set in SB (83 +/- 4.2) and MV (78.5 +/- 6.4) compared with NP (52.6 +/- 7.6). However, the average weight of the fruit was similar for the three treatments (65 g). There were significant differences for seed number in SB (200 +/- 15.3) and MV (232 +/- 21.4) compared with NP (120 +/- 16.6). The productivity in kilograms of fruit per square meter was higher in SB (5.72 +/- 0.61) and MV (5.66 +/- 0.58 kg) compared with NP (3.34 +/- 0.72). The number of seed was positively correlated with the weight of the fruit. We conclude that the use of Nannotrigona testaceicornis Rondani, for pollinating greenhouse tomatoes in tropical climates, could be an alternative to the use of highly defensive African-derived Apis mellifera or non-native bumble bees (Bombus spp.). However, more research is needed to evaluate the cost/benefit on large-scale greenhouse pollination using N. perilampoides Cresson against other bee species and pollination methods.","2009","2022-11-02 15:37:39","2022-11-02T15:37:39Z",NA,"475–481","",2,97,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our aim was to determine the pollinator mediated effects of both proximity and abundance of an alien species on the reproductive success of natives. We chose the highly invasive Impatiens glandulifera and two native species: Epilobium angustifolium and Aconitum napellus ssp. lusitanicum. These species share characteristics allowing for pollination interactions: similar biotopes, overlapping flowering periods and same main pollinators. The effects of abundance (5, 25 and 100 individuals) and proximity (0 and 15 m) of the alien on visitation rate, insect behaviour, pollen deposition and reproductive success of both natives were investigated during 2 flowering seasons. We used centred visitation rates as they can be directly interpreted as a positive or negative effect of the invasive. Both abundance and proximity of the alien increased bumblebee visitation rates to both natives. On the other hand, abundance of the exotic species had a slight negative effect on honeybee visits to natives while its proximity had no effect. The behaviour of bumblebees changed as visitors left significantly more often the native plants for I. glandulifera when its abundance increased. As a consequence of this "" inconstancy "" , bees deposited considerable quantities of alien pollen on native stigmas. Nevertheless, this interspecific pollen transfer did not decrease seed set in natives. Self-compatibility and high attractiveness of both native species probably alleviate the risk of altered pollinator services and reproductive success due to the invader in natural populations.","2012","2022-11-02 15:37:37","2022-11-02T15:37:37Z",NA,"130–139","",17,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; facilitation; flower constancy; pollen deposition; seed set; visitation rate","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The main concern is whether some chemicals can enhance the effect of other chemicals, so that they jointly exert a larger effect than predicted. This phenomenon is called synergy. Here we present a review of the scientific literature on three main groups of environmentally relevant chemical toxicants: pesticides, metal ions and antifouling compounds. The aim of the review is to determine 1) the frequency of synergy, 2) the extent of synergy, 3) whether any particular groups or classes of chemicals tend to induce synergy, and 4) which physiological mechanisms might be responsible for this synergy. Synergy is here defined as mixtures with minimum two-fold difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations using Concentration Addition (CA) as a reference model and including both lethal and sub-lethal endpoints. The results showed that synergy occurred in 7%, 3% and 26% of the 194, 21 and 136 binary pesticide, metal and antifoulants mixtures included in the data compilation on frequency. The difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations was rarely more than 10-fold. For pesticides, synergistic mixtures included cholinesterase inhibitors or azole fungicides in 95% of 69 described cases. Both groups of pesticides are known to interfere with metabolic degradation of other xenobiotics. For the four synergistic metal and 47 synergistic antifoulant mixtures the pattern in terms of chemical groups inducing synergy was less clear. Hypotheses in terms of mechanisms governing these interactions are discussed. It was concluded that true synergistic interactions between chemicals are rare and often occur at high concentrations. Addressing the cumulative rather than synergistic effect of co-occurring chemicals, using standard models as CA, is therefore regarded as the most important step in the risk assessment of chemical cocktails.","2014","2022-11-02 15:37:34","2022-11-02T15:37:34Z",NA,"5","",5,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

After 6 d of feeding 50 mug DF, hypopharyngeal gland development, measured as size of acini, was significantly suppressed in both bee species. The suppressed gland development in the treated group could be a consequence of poor gain in weight.

We compared eight models ranging from niche-based to process-based models. On average, models project large range contractions of temperate tree species in lowlands due to climate change. There was substantial disagreement between models for temperate broadleaf deciduous tree species, but differences in the capacity of models to account for rising CO(2) impacts explained much of the disagreement.

The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS An improved, automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay with a high degree of trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, crop oil concentrates, and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 µg organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the crop oil concentrates were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants has been demonstrated here for the first time. Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time. Impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level, as well as potentially many social interactions. Organosilicone spray adjuvants may therefore contribute to the ongoing global decline in honey bee health.","2012","2022-11-02 15:36:52","2022-11-02T15:36:52Z",NA,"e40848","",7,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22815841",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These two prevailing models, as they stand, are conceptually divergent. The MSL model implicitly assumes that, at a given site, for each grazing intensity there is a single equilibrium situation with a single diversity value. The S–T model suggests that rangeland dynamics include irreversible transitions and alternative equilibria. Here we propose a modification of the original MSL model, to encompass a wider range of real situations and to place it within the context of the S–T model. The four extreme cases proposed in the original MSL model are revisited, taking into account that (1) the ‘‘moisture” gradient can be generalized as a ‘‘productivity” gradient; (2) the selective pressure of herbivores on systems with long history of grazing has fluctuated over time, allowing the development of different pools of species adapted to low or high grazing intensities; and (3) systems with long evolutionary history of grazing have developed resilience mechanisms that allow reversible shifts in floristic composition with changes in grazing intensities. The grazing intensity vs. diversity curves thus postulated for systems with a long evolutionary history of grazing are similar to those proposed by the original MSL model because resilience mechanisms allow for reversible changes as- sociated with grazing intensity. In contrast, the curves postulated for systems with short evolutionary history of grazing include different alternative branches, indicating irreversible transitions, because resilience mechanisms to grazing were not fully developed. By incor- porating these modifications, the divergence between the original MSL and S–T models can be resolved. A set of published examples from real systems is presented and compared with the predictions of the modified model. The modified MSL model is applicable to a wider range of real situations than the MSL model in its original formulation","2005","2022-11-02 15:36:50","2022-11-02T15:36:50Z",NA,"757–773","",2,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Disturbance-diversity models; Grassland diversity; Grazing history; Plant community structure; Productivity; Range succession model; Resilience; Resource availability; State and transition model; Ungulates","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also evaluated these effects separately by butterfly guilds based on their region-wide rarity and on degree of specialization. The distribution of abundances of the 44 species observed showed an excess of uncommon species compared to a log-normal distribution, and the two most abundant species were exotic (Thymelicus lineola and Pieris rapae). We used an information theoretic approach to model selection to determine the most important correlates of butterfly species richness. Models of mean butterfly richness per visit explained greater variance than did models of cumulative richness across the season. Cumulative butterfly species richness was affected more at larger spatial scales, while richness per visit was affected similarly at all spatial scales. The most consistent local factor affecting butterfly diversity was the number of nectar producing plants that were flowering. The most consistent landscape-level correlates of species richness were number of people (at small spatial scales) and green space. Measures of increased urbanization were associated with decreased butterfly species richness, and rare and specialized species were most affected. Species that were regionally rare, and those that specialized both in host plants and had few broods, disappeared with declining richness across sites 2.9–4.5 times faster than did generalists and less restricted specialists.","2007","2022-11-02 15:36:48","2022-11-02T15:36:48Z",NA,"321–337","",3,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Habitat specialist; Lepidoptera; Species diversity; Sprawl; Urbanization","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Strain BC-3T (T = type strain), which was isolated from the honeybee, was chosen as a representative of this cluster and was characterized according to accepted standards. This strain and other strains of the cluster entered the hemocoel of their insect hosts after per os acquisition, caused pathology in various tissues, and reduced adult longevity. Growth in SM-1 or M1D medium occurred at 20 to 37{degrees}, with optimum growth at about 32 to 35{degrees}. Cholesterol was required for growth. Glucose, fructose, and other carbohydrates were fermented, and arginine was catabolized. Seventeen strains, including strain BC-3T, reacted with considerable homogeneity in deformation tests and were completely separable from strains of subgroup I-1 (Spiroplasma citri) and subgroup I-3 (corn stunt spiroplasma). A group of five subgroup I-2 strains showed homogeneity upon one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell proteins. Strain BC-3T was also serologically distinct from subgroups I-4 through I-8; from Spiroplasma floricola, Spiroplasma apis, and Spiroplasma mirum; and from representative strains of spiroplasma groups II and VI through XI. Previously published studies on strain BC-3T and related strains demonstrated that (i) these organisms comprise a unique subgroup of the S. citri complex (group I); (ii) deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid homologies between strain BC-3T and strains of other group I subgroups do not exceed 70%; (iii) the patterns of protein sharing among group I strains revealed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis support molecular genetic indications of partial relatedness; (iv) the EcoRI restriction endonuclease patterns of deoxyribonucleic acids from strain BC-3T and serologically related strains show close relatedness; (v) sequencing of 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid suggests some degree of relatedness with all organisms now classified in the Mollicutes; (vi) strain BC-3T is capable of viscotactic and chemotactic responses; (vii) strain BC-3T possesses fibrils that may mediate various types of motility; and (viii) a lytic virus (SpV4) isolated from Spiroplasma sp. strain B63 (a representative of subgroup I-2) is morphologically and genomically distinct from other spiroplasma viruses and forms plaques only on lawns of subgroup I-2 spiroplasmas. Previous work on strain AS 576, another member of subgroup I-2, demonstrated (i) a viscotactic response, (ii) moderate sensitivity to osmotic environments, (iii) susceptibility to tetracycline and aminoglycoside antibiotics, (iv) growth in a relatively simple, chemically defined medium, (v) nutritional utilization patterns in defined medium, and (vi) a genome molecular weight of 109. On the basis of our new findings and the previously described properties of strain BC-3T and related subgroup I-2 strains, we propose that spiroplasma strains with the characteristics described here be classified as a new species, Spiroplasma melliferum.

We assembled data for 57 species across 24 studies where flowering or vegetative phenology was matched with a measure of species performance. Performance metrics included biomass, percent cover, number of flowers, or individual growth. We found that species that advanced their phenology with warming also increased their performance, whereas those that did not advance tended to decline in performance with warming.

Comparisons were made to determine whether the commercial raspberry showed xenic tendencies in cross-pollination. The average weight of self-pollinated raspberry drupelets was compared to that of cross-pollinated drupelets. We also examined the correlation between the weight and number of fertilized ovules from both self-pol-linated and cross-pollinated berries. Four raspberry varieties—'Carnival,' 'Festival,' 'Latham,' and 'Muskoka'—were cross-and self-pollinated during 1986-87. Results indicate that a metaxenic phenomenon does occur in raspberries. In 1987, the freely cross-pollinated Festival had an average drupelet weight superior to that of self-pollinated control. We also noticed that the relation between raspberry weight and the number of drupelets were higher in Festival than in Muskoka.","1990","2022-11-02 15:36:36","2022-11-02T15:36:36Z",NA,"434–437","",6,81,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because the presence of sublethal doses or concentrations may also alter the behavior of foraging insects, we attempted to devise a quantifiable and accurate protocol for evidencing various alterations in free-flying bees. Such a protocol was illustrated by testing new classes of systemic insecticides. The protocol focused on video recording to quantify the foraging activity of small colonies of honey bees confined in insect-proof tunnels. The basis of the protocol was not the colony itself but the change in each colony on a specific day and between days. First, the paradigms of attendance at a safe feeding source were established by observing 8 control colonies at different times of the season during 5 days after the necessary forager training was accomplished. Second, on three different colonies we considered the paradigms on the control day before contamination and during 4 days after the feeding source was contaminated. During the same period, one more colony was exclusively fed with safe food to serve as control. Two plant-systemic insecticides were tested at contamination levels 70 times lower than the 50% of the lethal concentration. Imidacloprid, at 6 microg/kg, clearly induced a decrease in the proportion of active bees. Fipronil, at 2 microg/kg, induced an additional decrease in attendance at the feeder. Such levels are still higher than the corresponding lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC). Our protocol, which provided intermediate conditions between field and laboratory conditions, allowed the quantification, with an enhanced level of sensitivity, of sublethal effects on foraging bees.","2004","2022-11-02 15:36:33","2022-11-02T15:36:33Z",NA,"387–395","",3,47,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Commercially-produced bumble bees used in greenhouse pollination often have higher levels of various pathogens than wild bumble bees. These pathogens may spread to wild bees when commercial bees escape from greenhouses and interact with their wild counterparts at nearby flowers. We examined the prevalence of four pathogens in wild bumble bee populations at locations near and distant to commercial greenhouses in southern Ontario, Canada. Bumble bees collected near commercial greenhouses were more frequently infected by those pathogens capable of being transmitted at flowers (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi) than bees collected at sites away from greenhouses. We argue that the spillover of pathogens from commercial to wild bees is the most likely cause of this pattern and we discuss the implications of such spillover for bumble bee conservation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Pesticide exposure and pathogen infection are recognised as potential stressors impacting upon bee populations and recently there has been a surge in research on pesticide?disease interactions to reflect environmentally realistic scenarios better. We critically analyse the findings on pesticide?disease interactions, including effects on the survival, pathogen loads and immunity of bees, and assess the suitability of various endpoints to inform our mechanistic understanding of these interactions. We show that pesticide exposure and pathogen infection have not yet been found to interact to affect worker survival under field-realistic scenarios. Colony-level implications of pesticide effects on Nosema infections, viral loads and honey bee immunity remain unclear as these effects have been observed in a laboratory setting only using a small range of pesticide exposures, generally exceeding those likely to occur in the natural environment, and assessing a highly selected series of immune-related endpoints. Future research priorities include the need for a better understanding of pesticide effects on the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) component of an individual's immune response and on social defence behaviours. Interactions between pesticide exposure and bacterial and fungal infections have yet to be addressed. The paucity of studies in non-Apis bee species is a further major knowledge gap.","2016","2022-11-02 15:36:26","2022-11-02T15:36:26Z",NA,"","1006–1019",NA,91,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,"Biological Reviews","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1111/brv.12206",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Nosema; acaricide; fungicide; immunity; molecular biomarkers; neonicotinoid; organophosphate; pyrethroid; viral infection","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

All apiaries employed for this study were specifically constructed without any metal part in order to avoid the risk of contamination of the assayed materials. Sample collection was conducted over a 3-month period (6 samplings for honey and pollen, 3 sampling for propolis and wax, 2 samplings for honeybees, all of which were collected in duplicate). Experimental data revealed, in general, statistically significant differences between the background levels of heavy metals recorded from the reference sites and the levels measured in the site located in the center of the city of Rome.

Within these general trends toward earlier spring, however, are species that either have insignificant trends or have delayed their timing. Various explanations have been offered to explain this apparent nonresponsiveness to warming, including the influence of other abiotic cues (e.g., photoperiod) or reductions in fall/winter chilling (vernalization). Few studies, however, have explicitly attributed the historical trends of nonresponding species to any specific factor. Here, we analyzed long-term data on phenology and seasonal temperatures from 490 species on two continents and demonstrate that (i) apparent nonresponders are indeed responding to warming, but their responses to fall/winter and spring warming are opposite in sign and of similar magnitude; (ii) observed trends in first flowering date depend strongly on the magnitude of a given species' response to fall/winter vs. spring warming; and (iii) inclusion of fall/winter temperature cues strongly improves hindcast model predictions of long-term flowering trends compared with models with spring warming only. With a few notable exceptions, climate change research has focused on the overall mean trend toward phenological advance, minimizing discussion of apparently nonresponding species. Our results illuminate an understudied source of complexity in wild species responses and support the need for models incorporating diverse environmental cues to improve predictability of community level responses to anthropogenic climate change.","2012-06","2022-11-02 15:36:20","2022-11-02T15:36:20Z",NA,"9000–9005","",23,109,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pesticide regimes that threaten their sustainability should therefore be assessed. As an example, evidence that the agricultural use of neonicotinoid pesticides is a cause of the recently observed declines in honey bees is examined. The aim is to define exacting demographic conditions for a detrimental factor to precipitate a population decline, and Hill's epidemiological ‘causality criteria' are employed as a structured process for making an expert judgement about the proposition that trace dietary neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen cause population declines in honey bees. RESULTS: In spite of the absence of decisive experimental results, the analysis shows that, while the proposition is a substantially justified conjecture in the context of current knowledge, it is also substantially contraindicated by a wide variety of circumstantial epidemiological evidence. CONCLUSION:It is concluded that dietary neonicotinoids cannot be implicated in honey bee declines, but this position is provisional because important gaps remain in current knowledge. Avenues for further investigations to resolve this longstanding uncertainty are therefore identified.

One potential threat to bees is the unintended impact of systemic insecticides, which are ingested by bees in the nectar and pollen from flowers of treated crops. To establish whether imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid and insect neurotoxin, harms individual bees when ingested at environmentally realistic levels, we exposed adult worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), and honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), to dietary imidacloprid in feeder syrup at dosages between 0.08 and 125μgl-1. Honey bees showed no response to dietary imidacloprid on any variable that we measured (feeding, locomotion and longevity). In contrast, bumble bees progressively developed over time a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate with declines of 10-30% in the environmentally relevant range of up to 10μgl-1, but neither their locomotory activity nor longevity varied with diet. To explain their differential sensitivity, we speculate that honey bees are better pre-adapted than bumble bees to feed on nectars containing synthetic alkaloids, such as imidacloprid, by virtue of their ancestral adaptation to tropical nectars in which natural alkaloids are prevalent. We emphasise that our study does not suggest that honey bee colonies are invulnerable to dietary imidacloprid under field conditions, but our findings do raise new concern about the impact of agricultural neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.","2012","2022-11-02 15:36:00","2022-11-02T15:36:00Z",NA,"365–371","",6,115,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apis mellifera; Bombus terrestris; Detoxification; Neonicotinoid; Toxic nectar","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Conversely, downhill shifts are often considered anomalous and unrelated to climate change. By comparing the altitudinal distributions of 64 plant species between the 1930s and the present day within California, we show that climate changes have resulted in a significant downward shift in species' optimum elevations. This downhill shift is counter to what would be expected given 20th-century warming but is readily explained by species' niche tracking of regional changes in climatic water balance rather than temperature. Similar downhill shifts can be expected to occur where future climate change scenarios project increases in water availability that outpace evaporative demand.","2011-01","2022-11-02 15:35:56","2022-11-02T15:35:56Z",NA,"324–327","",6015,331,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","eng",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21252344",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Altitude; California; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plant Development; Plants; Temperature; Water","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

All rights reserved. To promote global food and ecosystem security, several innovative farming systems have been identified that better balance multiple sustainability goals. The most rapidly growing and contentious of these systems is organic agriculture. Whether organic agriculture can continue to expand will likely be determined by whether it is economically competitive with conventional agriculture. Here, we examined the financial performance of organic and conventional agriculture by conducting a meta-analysis of a global dataset spanning 55 crops grown on five continents. When organic premiums were not applied, benefit/cost ratios (-8 to -7%) and net present values (-27 to -23%) of organic agriculture were significantly lower than conventional agriculture. However, when actual premiums were applied, organic agriculture was significantly more profitable (22-35%) and had higher benefit/cost ratios (20-24%) than conventional agriculture. Although premiums were 29-32%, breakeven premiums necessary for organic profits to match conventional profits were only 5-7%, even with organic yields being 10-18% lower. Total costs were not significantly different, but labor costs were significantly higher (7-13%) with organic farming practices. Studies in our meta-analysis accounted for neither environmental costs (negative externalities) nor ecosystem services from good farming practices, which likely favor organic agriculture. With only 1% of the global agricultural land in organic production, our findings suggest that organic agriculture can continue to expand even if premiums decline. Furthermore, with their multiple sustainability benefits, organic farming systems can contribute a larger share in feeding the world.","2015","2022-11-02 15:35:49","2022-11-02T15:35:49Z",NA,"7611–7616","",24,112,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is important to understand the way they move in agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from their activity as pollinators. We surveyed bees using directional flight interception (Malaise) traps over a 1-year period in two agricultural landscapes in south-east Queensland, Australia. We placed traps at the ecotone between crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of movement between these habitats. Species richness in these landscapes (70) was high relative to that in comparable studies. Some bees were active year round, but most were caught in the period September to March. Across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where more species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant vegetation. The same bias was true for the number of individuals of the two most abundant species (Homalictus urbanus and Apis mellifera). Species exclusively found in crops were smaller on average (and therefore have smaller foraging range) than their non-crop counterparts. Together, these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop habitat, the remnant vegetation is important as the point of origin for bee movements, and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the dry native remnant. Compositional similarity among samples was significantly explained by landscape but also movement direction (i.e. to or from the riparian remnant) because different species showed different patterns of response. The landscape with greater native vegetation cover supported more species in and around crops than the landscape with less native vegetation.","2013","2022-11-02 15:35:47","2022-11-02T15:35:47Z",NA,"456–464","",4,38,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apoidea; Body size; Ecotone; Foraging; Habitat; Nesting","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Colony weight gain, honey production, pest incidence, bee mortality, number of adults, and amount of sealed brood were assessed in each colony throughout summer and autumn. Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected, and samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues. Several of these endpoints were also measured in spring 2013. Overall, colonies were vigorous during and after the exposure period, and we found no effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on any endpoint measures. Bees foraged heavily on the test fields during peak bloom and residue analysis indicated that honey bees were exposed to low levels (0.5-2 ppb) of clothianidin in pollen. Low levels of clothianidin were detected in a few pollen samples collected toward the end of the bloom from control hives, illustrating the difficulty of conducting a perfectly controlled field study with free-ranging honey bees in agricultural landscapes.

This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from ""conventional"" seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or ""organic"" seed that was not treated with pesticides. Samples of pollen were collected from corn plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1-0.8 ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96 ± 15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127 ± 17 workers per hive).

Yet few studies have investigated how different intensities of livestock grazing impact one important provider of these ecosystem services—native bees. We conducted the first large-scale manipulative study on the effect of a gradient of livestock grazing intensities on native bees in 16 40-ha pastures in the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie. Each pasture was exposed to one of four cattle stocking rates for two years and grazing intensity was quantified by measuring utilization. We measured soil and vegetation characteristics related to floral and nesting resources as well as several metrics of the bee community. Increased grazing intensity significantly reduced vegetation structure, soil stability, and herbaceous litter and significantly increased soil compaction and bare ground. Native bees responded with changes in abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition. Responses varied with taxa and time of season. Bumble bees were sensitive to grazing intensity early in the season, showing reduced abundance, diversity, and/or richness with increased intensity, potentially because of altered foraging behavior. In contrast, sweat bees appeared unaffected by grazing. These results show that native bee taxa vary in their sensitivity to livestock grazing practices and suggest that grazing may potentially be a useful tool for managing pollination services in mosaic agroecosystems that include rangelands.","2012","2022-11-02 15:35:38","2022-11-02T15:35:38Z",NA,"","",10,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bumble bees; Floral resources; Grazing intensity; Livestock grazing; Native bees; Nesting resources; Pacific northwest bunchgrass prairie; Pollinators; Soil characteristics; Sweat bees; Vegetation characteristics","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We compared species density of vascular plants, birds, bees, grasshoppers and crickets, and spiders on 202 paired fields, one with an agri-environment scheme, the other conventionally managed. In all countries, agri-environment schemes had marginal to moderately positive effects on biodiversity. However, uncommon species benefited in only two of five countries and species listed in Red Data Books rarely benefited from agri-environment schemes. Scheme objectives may need to differentiate between biodiversity of common species that can be enhanced with relatively simple modifications in farming practices and diversity or abundance of endangered species which require more elaborate conservation measures.","2006","2022-11-02 15:35:36","2022-11-02T15:35:36Z",NA,"243–254","",3,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Biodiversity conservation; European Union; Farmland wildlife; Land-use intensity; Policy evaluation; Red Data Book species","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a comparison of 24 agroforestry systems in Indonesia, the fruit set of coffee could be predicted by the number of flower-visiting bee species, and it ranged from ca. 60% (three species) to 90% (20 species). Diversity, not abundance, explained variation in fruit set, so the collective role of a species-rich bee community was important for pollination success. Additional experiments showed that single flower visits from rare solitary species led to higher fruit set than with abundant social species. Pollinator diversity was affected by two habitat parameters indicating guild-specific nesting requirements: the diversity of social bees decreased with forest distance, whereas the diversity of solitary bees increased with light intensity of the agroforestry systems. These results give empirical evidence for a positive relationship between ecosystem functions such as pollination and biodiversity.

Global declines in honeybees have led to concerns about negative impacts on food production because of low levels of pollination. This is exemplified in California where the demand for honeybees Apis mellifera to pollinate almond Prunus dulcis is increasing, but problems with honeybee health suggest it may not be sustainable to rely solely on the pollination service of a single species. 2. We investigated the effect of the quantity of surrounding natural habitat, organic management and strips of semi‐natural vegetation on flower visitation frequency of wild and managed pollinators and fruit set in 23 California almond orchards (15 conventional, 8 organic). Five conventional and four organic orchards were surrounded by a low percentage (\textless5%) of natural or semi‐natural habitat in a 1‐km radius and another five conventional and four organic orchards were surrounded by a high percentage of these habitats (\textgreater30%). A further five conventional orchards with a low percentage of surrounding natural habitat had an adjacent strip of semi‐natural vegetation and were included in the study to represent a realistic option for orchard management in intensive agricultural landscapes. 3. Wild bee species visited almond flowers but only in orchards with adjacent semi‐natural habitat or vegetation strips. Organic management increased the flower visitation frequencies of hover flies and wild bees. The presence of a strip of semi‐natural vegetation in orchards with a low percentage of surrounding natural habitat increased the number of species and the flower visitation frequency by wild pollinators but only at orchard edges and not to the degree seen when natural habitat was abundant. 4. Wild bee species richness and flower visitation frequency, but not honeybee frequency, were related to fruit set. Fruit set increased with increasing percentage of natural habitat surrounding the orchards. Organic farming or the presence of a vegetation strip did not increase fruit set. 5. Synthesis and applications. The restoration of high quality habitat strips along the edges of crop fields in highly intensified agricultural landscapes should be encouraged and monitored to conserve pollinators and to determine whether benefits for agriculture can be realized. Although honeybees are the main and most important pollinating insects for many plants, wild pollinators may be necessary to ensure high fruit set.

We suggest a novel mechanism–in systems in which mutualists of plants are present and important, predators can have indirect negative effects on producers through their consumption of mutualists. The strength of predator effects on producers will depend on their relative consumption of mutualists and antagonists, and on the relative importance of each to producer population dynamics. In a meta-analysis of experiments that examine the effects of predator reduction on the pollination and reproductive success of plants, we found that the indirect negative effects of predators on plants are quite strong. Most predator removal experiments measure the strength of predator effects on producers through the antagonist pathway; we suggest that a more complete understanding of the role of predators will be achieved by simultaneously considering the effects of predators on plant mutualists.","2006","2022-11-02 15:35:21","2022-11-02T15:35:21Z",NA,"1173–1178","",11,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Food web; Indirect effects; Meta-analysis; Pollination success; Predator removal; Trophic cascade","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Animal hosts harbour diverse and often specific bacterial communities (microbiota) in their gut. These microbiota can provide crucial services to the host such as aiding in digestion of food and immune defence. However, the ecological factors correlating with and eventually shaping these microbiota under natural conditions are poorly understood. 2. Bumblebees have recently been shown to possess simple and highly specific microbiota. We here examine the dynamics of these microbiota in field colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris over one season. The gut bacteria were assessed with culture-independent methods, that is, with terminal restriction fragment length profiles of the 16S rRNA gene. 3. To further understand the factors that affect the microbiota, we experimentally manipulated field-placed colonies in a fully factorial experiment by providing additional food or by priming the workers' immune system by injecting heat-killed bacteria. We furthermore looked at possible correlates of diversity and composition of the microbiota for (i) natural infections with the microbial parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi, (ii) bumblebee worker size, (iii) colony identity, and (iv) colony age. 4. We found an increase in diversity of the microbiota in individuals naturally infected with either C. bombi or N. bombi. Crithidia bombi infections, however, appear to be only indirectly linked with higher microbial diversity when comparing colonies. The treatments of priming the immune system with heat-killed bacteria and additional food supply, as well as host body size, had no effect on the diversity or composition of the microbiota. Host colony identity had only a weak effect on the composition of the microbiota at the level of resolution of our method. We found both significant increases and decreases in the relative abundance of selected bacterial taxa over the season. 5. We present the first study on the ecological dynamics of gut microbiota in bumblebees and identify parasite infections, colony identity and colony age as important factors influencing the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities. The absence of an effect of our otherwise effective experimental treatments suggests a remarkable ability of the host to maintain a homoeostasis in this community under widely different environments.","2012","2022-11-02 15:35:19","2022-11-02T15:35:19Z",NA,"1202–1210","",6,81,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Field experiment; Immune system; Microsporidia; Social insects; Species-area relationship; Specificity; Symbiont; Trypanosomatidae","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we contributed to the further development of stingless beekeeping by investigating the long-term impact of management and climate on honey production and colony survival in the stingless bee Melipona subnitida Ducke (1910). We analyzed a 10-yr record of 155 M. subnitida colonies kept by a commercial honey producer of northeastern Brazil. This constitutes the longest and most accurate record available for a stingless bee. We modeled honey production in relation to time (years), age, management practices (colony division and food supplementation), and climatic factors (temperature and precipitation), and used a model selection approach to identify which factors best explained honey production. We also modeled colony mortality in relation to climatic factors. Although the amount of honey produced by each colony decreased over time, we found that the probability of producing honey increased over the years. Colony divisions decreased honey production, but did not affect honey presence, while supplementary feeding positively affected honey production. In warmer years, the probability of producing honey decreased and the amount of honey produced was lower. In years with lower precipitation, fewer colonies produced honey. In contrast, colony mortality was not affected by climatic factors, and some colonies lived up to nine years, enduring extreme climatic conditions.

Serine proteinases were found to be predominant, with metallo and especially cysteine proteinases making a smaller albeit significant contribution. The compensatory response to in vivo enzyme inhibition was similar for SBTI and rOC-1 although less pronounced for rOC-1.

The distribution, status and factors threatening all 60 known taxa (species and subspecies) of Bombini of 11 countries of Western and Central Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) were assessed from the beginning of the 20th century. The analysis was based on a literature review, unpublished data, personal communications, our own observations, and an expert review. The IUCN Red List categories were used for assessing the threat of extinction. Eighty per cent of taxa were threatened in at least one country of the region, and 30% of taxa were threatened throughout their range in the countries considered. More species went extinct per country in the second than in the first half of the 20th century, and four taxa went extinct in all 11 countries during 1951–2000. Amongst the factors adversely affecting the Bombini anthropogenic factors (particularly those associated with large-scale farming schemes) appear to be of greater importance than natural factors. To halt population declines and species extinctions it will be necessary to preserve aspects of traditional farming practices and for all Bombini to be afforded legal protection in all countries of the region. The implementation of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy is likely to have the greatest single impact upon pollinators in the near future.","2007","2022-11-02 15:35:10","2022-11-02T15:35:10Z",NA,"79–88","",1,41,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Weed species were divided into groups according to their residence time in Central Europe (native species, archaeophytes, neophytes) and nitrogen preference (low to medium, LMNP, and high, HNP species). The percentage of semi-natural habitats was calculated in the 500 m radius circle. Effects of fertilizer use, transect position and semi-natural habitats were estimated by general linear mixed models.Results: We recorded 149 weed species. Fertilizer had a negative impact on the species richness of archaeophytes and LMNP species, and on the cover of native weeds. There was greater species richness and weed cover at the edge of the fields than in the centre. A higher percentage of seminatural habitats around the arable fields resulted in greater total species richness, especially of archaeophytes and LMNP species. We found an interaction between the percentage of semi-natural habitats and transect position for species richness of archaeophytes and LMNP species.Conclusions: Reduced use of fertilizers and a high percentage of semi-natural habitats would support native and archaeophyte weed diversity even in winter cereal fields, while large amounts of fertilizer may promote invasion of neophytes.

In contrast, experimental studies of biodiversity-function examine communities whose structures often differ markedly from those providing services in real landscapes. A bridge is needed between these two approaches. To develop this research agenda, I discuss critical questions and key approaches in four areas: (1) identifying the important 'ecosystem service providers'; (2) determining the various aspects of community structure that influence function in real landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3) assessing key environmental factors influencing provision of services, and (4) measuring the spatio-temporal scale over which providers and services operate.

Agrobiodiversity is sustained by diversified farming practices and it also supplies multiple ecosystem services to agriculture, thus reducing environmental externalities and the need for off-farm inputs. We reviewed the literature that compares biologically diversified farming systems with conventional farming systems, and we examined 12 ecosystem services: biodiversity; soil quality; nutrient management; water-holding capacity; control of weeds, diseases, and pests; pollination services; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency and reduction of warming potential; resistance and resilience to climate change; and crop productivity. We found that compared with conventional farming systems, diversified farming systems support substantially greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional monocultures, diversified farming systems also enhance control of weeds, diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services; however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to agroecological research and the improvement of diversified farming systems than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support, diversified farming systems have only somewhat reduced mean crop productivity relative to conventional farming systems, but they produce far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified farming systems and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single diversified farming system practices, such as crop rotation, influence multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and integrated across many components of the farming system. Detailed agroecological research especially is needed to develop crop- and region-specific approaches to control of weeds, diseases, and pests. © 2012 by the author(s).","2012","2022-11-02 15:34:53","2022-11-02T15:34:53Z",NA,"40","","4",17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 776",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agricultural food production; Agricultural intensification; Agrobiodiversity; Agroecology; Biodiversity; Conventional agriculture; Conventional farming systems; Diversified farming systems; Ecosystem services; Land-sharing; Landsparing; Organic agriculture","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this ""free"" service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.","2002","2022-11-02 15:34:49","2022-11-02T15:34:49Z",NA,"16812–6","","26",99,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 12486221",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.","2007","2022-11-02 15:34:46","2022-11-02T15:34:46Z",NA,"299–314","","4",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17355569",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The commercialisation of Megachile rotundata in the USA and Canada for the pollination of alfalfa has encouraged, according to some opinions, the research of other species of solitary bees as pollinators of cultivated plants. Today, the efficient rearing technology of several species of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) is developed for pollination of plants in greenhouses. A number of species of orchard bees (Osmia spp.), as well as several other species of wild bees, are being successfully reared for plant pollination in different parts of the world. For example, the pollination of apples in Japan is done almost exclusively with their autochthonous species of the genus Osmia. In the USA the autochthonous species Osmia lignaria is commercially being used for the pollination of orchards, as well as the species O. cornifrons, introduced from Japan. In Europe the autochthonous species O. rufa and O. cornuta are being used for the pollination of orchards and some other cultures. The species Osmia cornuta is distributed in south-eastern Europe, it is relatively easily reared, and it is more efficient as orchard pollinator than the honey bee. In the Institute of Zoology of the Faculty of Biology of the University of Belgrade the research of the domestication of this species and its usage for orchard pollination is being realised for more than the last 20 years. It is known, both to entomologists and fruit growers, that the lack of pollinators in agriculturally developed countries, including Serbia, is rather distinct. For the purpose of increasing the productivity of orchards in Serbia, the rearing and usage of O. cornuta as pollinator is presented in this monograph. This text is intended for entomologists and fruit growers, both beginners and owners of plantation orchards, as an instruction for further research and application in plant pollination. We hope that this paper will contribute to the spreading of the rearing of Osmia cornuta and its usage for orchard pollination, which should have a significant influence on the increase of productivity of fruit growing in our country.

The reduction of management intensity can be a useful tool for the long-term conservation of the biological diversity of grasslands. We analyzed floral and faunal diversity on intensively and extensively (unintensively) grazed pastures and on 5- to 10-year-old ungrazed grasslands in northern Germany. Each of the three grassland habitats differing in grazing intensity was replicated six times. We related diverse taxa such as grasshoppers, butterfly adults and lepidopteran larvae, and trap-nesting solitary bees and wasps to vegetation structure. There was an increase of species richness and abundance from pastures to ungrazed grasslands. The percentage of parasitism of the most abundant trap-nesting species, the digger-wasp Trypoxylon figulus), was also higher on ungrazed grasslands. Decreased grazing on pastures enhanced species richness for adult butterflies only, whereas the abundance of adult butterflies, solitary bees and wasps, and their natural enemies increased. Although the differences in insect diversity between pastures and ungrazed grassland could be attributed to a greater vegetation height and heterogeneity bottom-up effects) on ungrazed areas, the differences between intensively and extensively grazed pastures could not be explained by changes in vegetation characteristics. Hence, intensive grazing appeared to affect the insect communities through the disruption of plant-insect interactions. A mosaic of extensively grazed grassland and grassland left ungrazed for a few years may be a good means by which to maintain biodiversity and the strength of trophic interactions. Intensidad de Pastoreo y la Diversidad de Chapulines, Mariposas y Abejas y Avispas Resumen: El mantenimiento de pastizales como habitats distintos depende del manejo regular, generalmente, por medio de pastoreo o segado, pero se sabe que la diversidad de especies declina con el incremento de intensidad de manejo. La reduccion de la intensidad de manejo puede ser una herramienta util para la conservacion a largo plazo de la biodiversidad de pastizales. Analizamos la diversidad floristica y faunistica en pastizales pastoreados intensiva y extensivamente (no intensivos) y en pastizales de 5 a 10 anos no pastoreados en el norte de Alemania. Cada uno de los tres habitats de pastizal diferentes en el grado de pastoreo fue replicado seis veces. Relacionamos diversos taxones como chapulines, mariposas adultas, larvas de lepidopteros y abejas y avispas solitarias con la estructura de la vegetacion. Hubo un incremento en la riqueza y abundancia de especies de pastizales pastoreados a no pastoreados. El porcentaje de parasitismo de la especie de avispa mas abundante Trypoxylon figulus) tambien fue mayor en pastizales no pastoreados. La reduccion del pastoreo incremento la riqueza de especies de mariposas adultas solamente, mientras que incremento la abundancia de mariposas adultas, abejas y avispas solitarias y sus enemigos naturales. Aunque las diferencias en la diversidad de insectos entre pastizales pastoreados y no pastoreados pudiera atribuirse a la mayor altura de la vegetacion y a la heterogeneidad (efectos abajo-arriba) en areas no pastoreadas, las diferencias entre pastizales pastoreados intensiva y extensivamente no podria explicarse por cambios en las caracteristicas de la vegetacion. Por consiguiente, el pastoreo intensivo aparentemente afecto a las comunidades de insectos por la disrupcion de las interacciones planta-animal. Un mosaico de pastizales pastoreados extensivamente y pastizales sin pastoreo por varios anos puede ser una buena estrategia para mantener la biodiversidad y la vigencia de las interacciones troficas.","2002","2022-11-02 15:34:41","2022-11-02T15:34:41Z",NA,"1570–1580","","6",16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used and highly toxic to honey bees, have been found in previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season. These results have implications for a wide range of large-scale annual cropping systems that utilize neonicotinoid seed treatments.","2012","2022-11-02 15:34:36","2022-11-02T15:34:36Z",NA,"1","","1",7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we examine the potential impact of climate change on bees' geographic range in a global biodiversity hotspot. Location South Africa with a focus on the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) diversity hotspot. Methods Geographic ranges of 12 South African bee species representing dominant distribution types were studied, and the climate change impacts upon bees were examined with A2 and B2 climate scenarios of HadCM3 model, using MaxEnt for species distribution modelling. Results The predicted levels of climate change-induced impacts on species ranges varied from little shifts and range expansion of 5-50% for two species to substantial range contractions between 32% and 99% in another six species. Four species show considerable range shifts. Bees of the winter rainfall area in the west of South Africa generally have smaller range sizes than in the summer rainfall area and generally show eastward range contractions toward the dry interior. Bee species prevalent in summer rainfall regions show a tendency for a south-easterly shift in geographic range. Main conclusions The bee fauna of the CFR is identified as the most vulnerable to climate change due to the high level of endemism, the small range sizes and the island-like isolation of the Mediterranean-type climate region at the SW tip of Africa. For monitoring climate change impact on bees, we suggest to establish observatories in the coastal plains of the west coast that are predicted to be worst affected and areas where persistence of populations is most likely. Likely impacts of climate change on life history traits of bees (phenology, sociality, bee-host plant synchronization) are discussed but require further investigation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2012-09","2022-11-02 15:34:33","2022-11-02T15:34:33Z",NA,"885–897","","9",18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bees; Climate sensitivity; Done; Future climate scenario; Geographic range shift; Master Systematic; Pollination; Relevant; South Africa","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some margins were widened and vegetation was established by sowing of leguminous plants or was allowed to invade spontaneously. The communities of pollinating insects in reclaimed field margins were compared with those of a margin with a naturally diverse flora and an adjacent pasture. A beehive was placed in the area and the collection of pollen by the honey-bees was followed over the season in order to compare the bees' preferences with the supply of flowering plants available in the different experimental field margins. The sown leguminous plants were very attractive to most insect groups, especially bees and bumble-bees, and their pollen constituted an important part of the bees' total catch. The vegetation established by spontaneous succession especially attracted Syrphidae and other groups of Diptera. Butterflies were found in all vegetation types.

Because Erythronium grandiflorum is an early-season bloomer, alterations in its phenology may have serious implications for many North American Rocky Mountain communities, including changes in resource availability for pollinators and herbivores. Methods: We investigated whether changes in the snowmelt date, summer temperature, and summer precipitation have altered the timing and abundance of flowering in E. grandiflorum by collecting long-term data on floral abundance from 1975-2008 in a series of 2 ? 2 m plots at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Gothic, Colorado in the United States. Key results: Snowmelt date and mean summer temperature were negatively correlated. Over the 30-yr study, the snowmelt date advanced by 4.14 d/decade, and mean summer temperature increased by 0.38?C/decade. Summer precipitation was variable, showing no change. The first, peak, and last flowering dates of E. grandiflorum advanced an average of 3.2 d/decade. Further-more, earlier snowmelt and greater summer precipitation in the previous year led to earlier flowering in E. grandiflorum. There was no change in flowering abundance in this species, indicating it may be controlled by a complex set of abiotic and biotic variables. Conclusions: Our study indicates that snowmelt is arriving earlier at the RMBL, which has caused earlier flowering in E. grandiflorum. Because alterations in phenology can disrupt important ecological interactions, information on potential phenological shifts in species that interact with E. grandiflorum is essential in determining the net effect of climate-driven alterations in phenology. ? 2010 Botanical Society of America.","2010","2022-11-02 15:34:18","2022-11-02T15:34:18Z",NA,"1431–1437","","9",97,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Climate change; Erythronium; Flowering phenology; Glacier lily; Liliaceae; Precipitation; Rocky mountain biological laboratory; Snowmelt date","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recently, association mapping has been exploited to dissect quantitative trait loci (QTL). With the exception of maize and Arabidopsis, little research has been conducted on LD in plants. The mating system of the species (selfing versus outcrossing), and phenomena such as population structure and recombination hot spots, can strongly influence patterns of LD.

We reviewed publications that reported on the direct toxic effects of Bt-maize and/or Cry proteins of current Bt-maize events on larvae of non-target butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). In total, 20 peer-reviewed publications were identified, of which 16 papers contributed laboratory-based data and seven field-based data. An adverse effect on caterpillars was recorded in 52&37; of all laboratory-based and in 21&37; of all field-based observations. The variables most often studied and having the highest occurrence of effects were larval survival, body mass, and developmental time. Parameters of the adult stage were under-represented in the studies. Overall, 11 lepidopteran species were tested. The majority of the studies originated from the USA, with the Monarch butterfly being the most studied, whereas other species and other parts of the world were widely neglected. Laboratory experiments were often run under unrealistic conditions from an ecological point of view. Although the papers we reviewed indicated a potential hazard for Lepidoptera that are exposed to and feed on lepidopteran-specific Bt-maize pollen, a general conclusion on the level of risk for butterflies and moths cannot as yet be drawn. A comprehensive risk characterization would require thorough hazard identification, exposure assessment, and impact assessment. However, our review showed that even the basic level of hazard characterization is as yet incomplete. Reasons for this are the still-limited numbers of publications and concurrent lack of knowledge, the restriction of data to only a few species, the over-representation of North American species, and the identified limitations of both laboratory and field experiments. The findings of this review suggest that more realistic, ecologically meaningful, and detailed experiments and analyses are crucial to improve the present assessment of Bt-maize cultivation effects on Lepidoptera.","2010","2022-11-02 15:34:11","2022-11-02T15:34:11Z",NA,"121–134","","2",135,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Butterflies; Cry protein; GMO; Moths; Non-target organism; Review; Risk assessment; Side effects; Transgenic corn; Zea mays","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants, neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees, but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated. After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days, and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop. Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly contaminated by spray residues contained 171±44 ppb clothianidin. Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present at the time of treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears non-hazardous to bumble bees.","2013","2022-11-02 15:34:03","2022-11-02T15:34:03Z",NA,"6","","6",8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Wild bees are one of the most important groups of pollinators in the temperate zone. Therefore, population declines have potentially negative impacts for both crop and wildflower pollination. Although heavy metal pollution is recognized to be a problem affecting large parts of the European Union, we currently lack insights into the effects of heavy metals on wild bees. 2. We investigated whether heavy metal pollution is a potential threat to wild bee communities by comparing (i) species number, (ii) diversity and (iii) abundance as well as (iv) natural mortality of emerging bees along two independent gradients of heavy metal pollution, one at Olkusz (OLK), Poland and the other at Avonmouth (AVO), UK. We used standardized nesting traps to measure species richness and abundance of wild bees, and we recorded the heavy metal concentration in pollen collected by the red mason bee Osmia rufa as a measure of pollution. 3. The concentration of cadmium, lead and zinc in pollen collected by bees ranged from a background level in unpolluted sites [OLK: 1AE3, 43AE4, 99AE8 (mg kg)1); AVO: 0AE8, 42AE0, 56AE0 (mg kg)1), respectively] to a high level on sites in the vicinity of the OLK and AVO smelters [OLK: 6AE7, 277AE0, 440AE1 (mg kg)1); AVO: 9AE3, 356AE2, 592AE4 (mg kg)1), respectively]. 4. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration, there was a steady decrease in the number, diversity and abundance of solitary, wild bees. In the most polluted sites, traps were empty or contained single occupants, whereas in unpolluted sites, the nesting traps collected from 4 to 5 species represented by up to ten individuals. Moreover, the proportion of dead individuals of the solitary bee Megachile ligniseca increased along the heavy metal pollution gradient at OLK from 0AE2 in uncontaminated sites to 0AE5 in sites with a high concentration of pollution. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the negative relationship between heavy metal pollution and populations of wild bees and suggest that increasing wild bee richness in highly contaminated areas will require special conservation strategies. These may include creating suitable nesting sites and sowing a mixture of flowering plants as well as installing artificial nests with wild bee cocoons in polluted areas. Applying protection plans to wild pollinating bee communities in heavy metal-contaminated areas will contribute to integrated land rehabilitation to minimize the impact of pollution on the environment.","2011","2022-11-02 15:34:00","2022-11-02T15:34:00Z",NA,"118–125","","",49,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Key-words: Apoidea; biodiversity; cadmium; contamination; lead; pollen; pollinators; zinc","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of sys-temic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic conse-quences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicot-inoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 lg L -1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecun-dity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 lg L -1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imida-cloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicoti-noids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we rec-ognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neoni-cotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens.","2012","2022-11-02 15:33:57","2022-11-02T15:33:57Z",NA,"1937–1945","","7",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bombus terrestris microcolonies; Demographic toxicology; Fecundity; Neonicotinoid pesticides; Ovary development; Sublethal effects","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These impacts will occur at local, regional and larger scales. The potential impacts of climate change on marine mammals can be direct, such as the effects of reduced sea ice and rising sea levels on seal haul-out sites, or species tracking a specific range of water temperatures in which they can physically survive. Indirect effects of climate change include changes in prey availability affecting distribution, abundance and migra- tion patterns, community structure, susceptibility to disease and contaminants. Ultimately, these will impact on the reproductive success and survival of marine mammals and, hence, have conse- quences for populations. Marine mammal species, which have restricted geographical distributions with little or no opportunity for range expansion in response to climate change, may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The potential effects of climate change on marine mammals have a number of implications for their conservation and highlight several areas requiring further research.

Yet despite extensive research in agricultural and natural systems, less attention has focused on these interactions in neighboring urban areas and its impact on pollination services. We investigated pollinator-plant interactions in a peri-urban landscape on the outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area, California, where urban, agricultural, and natural land use types interface. We made standardized observations of floral visitation and measured seed set of yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a common grassland invasive, to test the hypotheses that increasing urbanization decreases 1) rates of bee visitation, 2) viable seed set, and 3) the efficiency of pollination (relationship between bee visitation and seed set). We unexpectedly found that bee visitation was highest in urban and agricultural land use contexts, but in contrast, seed set rates in these human-altered landscapes were lower than in natural sites. An explanation for the discrepancy between floral visitation and seed set is that higher plant diversity in urban and agricultural areas, as a result of more introduced species, decreases pollinator efficiency. If these patterns are consistent across other plant species, the novel plant communities created in these managed landscapes and the generalist bee species that are favored by human-altered environments will reduce pollination services.","2014","2022-11-02 15:33:47","2022-11-02T15:33:47Z",NA,"","","1",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Decisions to deregulate Bt crops in the USA have relied strongly on arguments that these crops will not interbreed with wild relatives in the permitted growing regions. Limited attention therefore has been directed to analyses of the consequences of gene flow. To provide a transparent evaluation process for risks associated with insecticidal transgene escape, we crafted a series of questions designed to guide this aspect of the risk assessment. We then explored the current knowledge base available for answering such risk-related questions for three Bt crops (cotton, rapeseed, and rice). First, we generated a list of wild relatives of these crops. A definitive list of potential transgene recipients is not yet possible for some crops. Sufficient data are not available for some crops to eliminate certain related plant species from consideration of fertile hybrid formation, thus making lists for these crops subject to speculation. Second, we queried the HOSTS database (UK) to obtain a worldwide listing of lepidopteran species that feed on these crops and their wild relatives, and to determine the host range of the larvae. To our knowledge, this list of 502 lepidopteran species is the first such list published for these crops and wild crop relatives. Third, we used a data set maintained by the Canadian Forest Service to assess Bt toxin susceptibility for these lepidopterans. Only 3% of those species have been tested for susceptibility; and the literature suggests that generalizations about susceptibility among taxa are difficult due to the variability within families. Fourth, we consulted the literature to interpret what is known about the ability of lepidopterans to regulate plant fitness or invasiveness. We could not eliminate the possibility of ecological release due to plant resistance against lepidopterans. In fact, there is strong experimental evidence that lepidopteran herbivores do limit the distribution and/or abundances of at least some wild plant species. Neither could we eliminate the possibility that non-target lepidopterans might have important functions in the ecosystem as pollinators or alternate hosts to natural enemies of pest species. This study suggests that crucial data are lacking for the development of a credible scientific basis to confirm or deny environmental risks associated with the escape of Bt transgene constructs to wild relatives. Given the absence of information on the identity, level of susceptibility, and ecological roles of lepidopterans exploiting specific wild relatives of Bt crops, we suggest that new efforts be directed to assessing possible consequences of lepidopteran mortality on resistant wild relatives.","2003","2022-11-02 15:33:43","2022-11-02T15:33:43Z",NA,"219–246","","4",2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted a nationwide survey to determine the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens and parasites in Asian honeybees, Apis cerana, in China. Our study provides evidence of infections of A. cerana by pathogenic Deformed wing virus (DWV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Nosema ceranae, and C. bombi species that have been linked to population declines of European honeybees, A. mellifera, and bumble bees. However, the prevalence of DWV, a virus that causes widespread infection in A. mellifera, was low, arguably a result of the greater ability of A. cerana to resist the ectoprasitic mite Varroa destructor, an efficient vector of DWV. Analyses of microbial communities from the A. cerana digestive tract showed that Nosema infection could have detrimental effects on the gut microbiota. Workers infected by N. ceranae tended to have lower bacterial quantities, with these differences being significant for the Bifidobacterium and Pasteurellaceae bacteria groups. The results of this nationwide screen show that parasites and pathogens that have caused serious problems in European honeybees can be found in native honeybee species kept in Asia. Environmental changes due to new agricultural practices and globalization may facilitate the spread of pathogens into new geographic areas. The foraging behavior of pollinators that are in close geographic proximity likely have played an important role in spreading of parasites and pathogens over to new hosts. Phylogenetic analyses provide insights into the movement and population structure of these parasites, suggesting a bidirectional flow of parasites among pollinators.

Many GM crop varieties have been developed in China in recent years; in particular, China is playing a leading role in development of insect-resistant GM rice lines. To ensure the safe use of GM crops, biosafety risk assessments are required as an important part of the regulatory oversight of such products. With over 20 years of nationwide promotion of agricultural biotechnology, a relatively well-developed regulatory system for risk assessment and management of GM plants has been developed that establishes a firm basis for safe use of GM crops. So far, a total of seven GM crops involving ten events have been approved for commercial planting, and 5 GM crops with a total of 37 events have been approved for import as processing material in China. However, currently only insect-resistant Bt cotton and disease-resistant papaya have been commercially planted on a large scale. The planting of Bt cotton and disease-resistant papaya have provided efficient protection against cotton bollworms and Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), respectively. As a consequence, chemical application to these crops has been significantly reduced, enhancing farm income while reducing human and non-target organism exposure to toxic chemicals.

Palaeoclimatic instability is a major mechanism of lineage diversification in taxa with low dispersal and small geographical ranges in tropical ecosystems. However, the impact of these climatic events remains questionable for the diversification of species with high levels of gene flow and large geographical distributions. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pleistocene climate change on three Neotropical orchid bee species (Eulaema bombiformis, E. meriana and E. cingulata) with transcontinental distributions and different physiological tolerances. We first generated ecological niche models to identify species-specific climatically stable areas during Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we inferred calibrated phylogenies and estimated historical demographic parameters to reconstruct the phylogeographical history of each species. Our results indicate species with narrower physiological tolerance experienced less suitable habitat during glaciations and currently exhibit strong population structure in the mitochondrial genome. However, nuclear markers with low and high mutation rates show lack of association with geography. These results combined with lower migration rate estimates from the mitochondrial than the nuclear genome suggest male-biased dispersal.

Bee communities and the pollination services they provide are important in cities, both for small-scale urban agriculture and native gardens. To better understand this important ecological issue, we examined bee communities, their response to novel floral resources, and their potential to provide pollination services in 25 neighborhoods across Chicago, IL (USA). In these neighborhoods, we evaluated how local floral resources, socioeconomic factors, and surrounding land cover affected abundance, richness, and community composition of bees active in summer. We also quantified species-specific body pollen loads and visitation frequencies to potted flowering purple coneflower plants (Echinacea purpurea) to estimate potential pollination services in each neighborhood. We documented 37 bee species and 79 flowering plant genera across all neighborhoods, with 8 bee species and 14 flowering plant genera observed on average along each neighborhood block. We found that both bee abundance and richness increased in neighborhoods with higher human population density, as did visitation to purple coneflower flower heads. In more densely populated neighborhoods, bee communities shifted to a suite of species that carry more pollen and are more active pollinators in this system, including the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and native species such as Agapostemon virescens. More densely populated neighborhoods also had a greater diversity of flowering plants, suggesting that the positive relationship between people and bees was mediated by the effect of people on floral resources. Other environmental variables that were important for bee communities included the amount of grass/herbaceous cover and solar radiation in the surrounding area. Our results indicate that bee communities and pollination services can be maintained in dense urban neighborhoods with single-family and multi-family homes, as long as those neighborhoods contain diverse and abundant floral resources. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2014","2022-11-02 15:33:03","2022-11-02T15:33:03Z",NA,"2857–2874","","11",23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Ecosystem service; Floral resources; Floral visitation; Human-environment interactions; Pollinators; Urban","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 primary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82%), involved the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (78%), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75%). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicotinoids on other species. Studies on crops were dominated by seed-treated maize, oilseed rape (canola) and sunflower, whereas less is known about potential side effects on bees from the use of other application methods on insect pollinated fruit and vegetable crops, or on lawns and ornamental plants. Laboratory approaches were most common, and we suggest that their capability to infer real-world consequences are improved when combined with information from field studies about realistic exposures to neonicotinoids. Studies using field approaches often examined only bee exposure to neonicotinoids and more field studies are needed that measure impacts of exposure. Most studies measured effects on individual bees. We suggest that effects on the individual bee should be linked to both mechanisms at the sub-individual level and also to the consequences for the colony and wider bee populations. As bees are increasingly facing multiple interacting pressures future research needs to clarify the role of neonicotinoids in relative to other drivers of bee declines.","2015","2022-11-02 15:32:58","2022-11-02T15:32:58Z",NA,"","","8",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In order to design effective measures to mitigate agricultural impact, simultaneous investigations of different taxonomic groups across several regions are required. Therefore, four contrasting taxonomic groups were investigated: plants, earthworms, spiders and bees (wild bees and bumblebees), which represent different trophic levels and provide different ecological services. To better understand underlying patterns, three community measurements for each taxonomic group were considered: abundance, species richness and species composition. In four European regions, ten potential environmental drivers of the four taxonomic groups were tested and assigned to three groups of drivers: geographic location (farm, region), agricultural management (crop type, mineral nitrogen input, organic nitrogen input, mechanical field operations and pesticide applications) and surrounding landscape in a 250. m buffer zone (diversity of habitats in the surroundings, proportion of arable fields and proportion of non-productive, non-woody habitats). First, the variation in abundance, species richness and species composition from 167 arable sites was partitioned to compare the relative contribution of the three groups of drivers (geographic location, agricultural management and surrounding landscape). Second, generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied to estimate the effect of the individual explanatory variables on abundance and species richness. Our analysis showed a dominant effect of geographic location in all four taxonomic groups and a strong influence of agricultural management on plants, spiders and bees. The effect of the surrounding landscape was of minor importance and inconsistent in our data. We conclude that in European arable fields, the avoidance of mineral nitrogen and pesticides is beneficial for biodiversity, and that species protection measures should take into account regional characteristics and the community structure of the investigated taxonomic groups. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2014","2022-11-02 15:32:54","2022-11-02T15:32:54Z",NA,"124–134","","",186,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Abundance; BioBio; Partitioning of variation; Species composition; Species richness","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Even though additional research is clearly needed, identifying, developing and implementing stringent management actions aimed at reducing inadequately installed, unnecessary or excessive lighting are well justified.

Community dynamics below ground are briefly described. The characteristics of stenophagous, polyphagous, predacious and parasitoid arthropods in relation to structure are outlined. Tall grassland supports more species, individuals and a greater diversity of arthropods than short swards, but some species are characteristic of the latter. The classification of structure in grassland is briefly reviewed. Change in grassland structure occurs through the opposing forces of succession and, in most cases, management. The commonest method of management is grazing, which is characterised by selectivity in the foliage eaten, treading of the sward and deposition of dung. Cutting is sudden, but its effects of defoliation are similar to those of grazing. Burning is considered in less detail. Ploughing, rotovating, re-seeding, fertiliser application, translocation and set-aside are generally forms of agricultural or ‘creative' management. Human treading can have severe effects on invertebrate diversity and abundance. Management interacts with other factors, such as seasonality, timing, topography, site-specific characteristics and connectivity to produce varied effects on arthropods. The various types of management systems, reclamation, maintenance, agricultural, rotational and others are discussed in relation to management plans and objectives in conservation. It is concluded that conservationists need to be more aware of grassland dynamics, that management by reference to past land-use must be tempered by full consideration of ecological factors and conservation aims and that ‘practical' and ‘theoretical' conservationists need to interact more effectively.","2000","2022-11-02 15:32:46","2022-11-02T15:32:46Z",NA,"129–142","","2",95,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Arthropods; Dynamics; Grassland; Management systems; Rotation; Structure; Succession","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The structure of pollination networks is described for two oceanic islands, the Azorean Flores and the Mauritian Ile aux Aigrettes. At each island site, all interactions between endemic, non?endemic native and introduced plants and pollinators were mapped. Linkage level, i.e. number of species interactions per species, was significantly higher for endemic species than for non?endemic native and introduced species. Linkage levels of the two latter categories were similar. Nine types of interaction may be recognized among endemic, non?endemic native and introduced plants and pollinators. Similar types had similar frequencies in the two networks. Specifically, we looked for the presence of ?invader complexes? of mutualists, defined as groups of introduced species interacting more with each other than expected by chance and thus facilitating each other?s establishment. On both islands, observed frequencies of interactions between native (endemic and non?endemic) and introduced pollinators and plants differed from random. Introduced pollinators and plants interacted less than expected by chance. Thus, the data did not support the existence of invader complexes. Instead, our study suggested that endemic super?generalist species, i.e. pollinators or plant species with a very wide pollination niche, include new invaders in their set of food plants or pollinators and thereby improve establishment success of the invaders. Reviewing other studies, super generalists seem to be a widespread island phenomenon, i.e. island pollination networks include one or a few species with a very high generalization level compared to co?occurring species. Low density of island species may lead to low interspecific competition, high abundance and ultimately wide niches and super generalization.","2002","2022-11-02 15:32:41","2022-11-02T15:32:41Z",NA,"181–192","","3",8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Azores; Mauritius; biological invasions; endemism; mutualisms; pollination; super generalist","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous analyses have rarely been reported due to sparse observations. Our results suggest that spring in China has started on average 2.88 days earlier per decade in response to spring warming by -4.93 days per degree Celsius over the last three decades. The shift towards an earlier start of spring was faster in two forest biomes (spring started on average 3.90 days earlier per decade) than in three grassland biomes (spring started on average 0.95 day earlier per decade). This difference was probably due to increased precipitation impacts in the grassland biomes.

Noticeably rare, however, are attempts to quantify temporal variation in the structure of plant–pollinator networks, and to determine whether the status of species as specialists or generalists is stable. Here we show that network structure varied through time in a montane meadow community from southern California, USA, in that pollinator species did not form the same links with plant species across years. Furthermore, composition of the generalized core group of species in the network varied among summers, as did the identity of those species involved in relationships that appeared to be reciprocally specialized within any one summer. These differences appear to be related to severe drought conditions experienced in the second summer of the 3 year study. In contrast to this variation, the pollinator community remained similarly highly nested in all three summers, even though species were packed into the nested matrix differently from year to year.

Previous studies have suggested that populations of introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) and bumblebee species (Bombus terrestris and Bombus ruderatus) in Argentina share the neogregarine parasite Apicystis bombi with the native bumblebee (Bombus dahlbomii). In this study we investigated whether A. bombi is acting as an emergent parasite in the non-native populations. Specifically, we asked whether A. bombi, recently identified in Argentina, was introduced by European, non-native bees. Using ITS1 and ITS2 to assess the parasite's intraspecific genetic variation in bees from Argentina and Europe, we found a largely unstructured parasite population, with only 15% of the genetic variation being explained by geographic location. The most abundant haplotype in Argentina (found in all 9 specimens of non-native species) was identical to the most abundant haplotype in Europe (found in 6 out of 8 specimens). Similarly, there was no evidence of structuring by host species, with this factor explaining only 17% of the genetic variation. Interestingly, parasites in native Bombus ephippiatus from Mexico were genetically distant from the Argentine and European samples, suggesting that sufficient variability does exist in the ITS region to identify continent-level genetic structure in the parasite. Thus, the data suggest that A. bombi from Argentina and Europe share a common, relatively recent origin. Although our data did not provide information on the direction of transfer, the absence of genetic structure across space and host species suggests that A. bombi may be acting as an emergent infectious disease across bee taxa and continents.","2013","2022-11-02 15:32:22","2022-11-02T15:32:22Z",NA,"e81475","","12",8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, not all pests are susceptible to Bt Cry toxins and there are concerns that even susceptible species may evolve to become resistant to these crops. The search for alternatives is well under way, with significant progress already made towards producing transgenic crops expressing insecticidal compounds from plants, such as protease inhibitors, lectins and alpha-amylase inhibitors. New types of proteins from B. thuringiensis, such as the vegetative insecticidal proteins, are also being exploited. At an earlier stage of development but attracting much research interest are other insecticidal compounds, such as chitinases, defensins, enhancins, biotin-binding proteins, proteases and toxins, sourced from bacteria, viruses, plants and arthropods. Fusion proteins, combining the features of different insecticidal proteins, have significant potential for extending the range of insect species which could be controlled via transgenic plants. In the future, metabolic engineering of plants could allow us to alter with great precision the ways in which plants and insects interact. The compatibility of these novel insect control strategies with biological control and integrated pest management is discussed.","2008","2022-11-02 15:32:17","2022-11-02T15:32:17Z",NA,"357–417","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4020-8373-0_13",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","Romeis, A M Shelton; Kennedy, G G",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The mantisfly larvae developed inside closed brood cells of the bee comb, where each mantispid larva fed on the bee larva or pupa present in a single brood cell. Mature mantispid larvae pupated inside silken cocoons spun in place within their hosts' brood cells then emerged as pharate adults inside the bee colony. Pharate adults were never attacked and killed by host colony workers. Instead, colony workers picked up the pharates and removed them from the nest unharmed, treating them similar to the way that the general refuse is removed from the nest. Adult mantispids subsequently eclosed from their pupal exuviae outside the nest. Manipulative experiments showed that post-eclosion adult mantispids placed back within active bee colonies were quickly attacked and killed. These observations demonstrate that pharate and post-eclosion adults of P. hagenella are perceived differently by colony workers and that delayed adult eclosion is an important functional element in the parasitic life strategy of P. hagenella, allowing adults to escape without injury from the bee colonies they parasitize.","2013","2022-11-02 15:32:14","2022-11-02T15:32:14Z",NA,"101–105","","1",100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Mantisfly biology; Melipona subnitida; Meliponini; Parasitism; Plega hagenella; Symphrasinae","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fast-evolving RNA viruses, known to cause severe colony losses in managed honeybee populations, deserve particular attention for their propensity to jump between host species and thus threaten ecologically and economically important wild pollinator communities. We review the literature on pollinator viruses to identify biological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence, highlight gaps in the literature, and discuss potential management strategies. We provide evidence that many wild pollinator species are exposed to viruses from commercial species, resulting in multiple spillover events. However, it is not clear whether species become infected as a result of spillover or whether transmission is occurring within these wild populations. Ecological traits of pollinating insects, such as overlapping ranges, niches and behaviours, clearly promote cross-species transmission of RNA viruses. Moreover, we conclude that the social behaviour and phylogenetic relatedness of social pollinators further facilitate within- and between-host transmission, leaving these species particularly vulnerable to emerging diseases. We argue that the commercial use of pollinators is a key driver of disease emergence in these beneficial insects and that this must be addressed by management and policy. Synthesis and applications. There are important knowledge gaps, ranging from disease distribution and prevalence, to pathogen life history and virulence, to the impacts of disease emergence, which need to be addressed as research priorities. It is clear that avoiding anthropogenic pathogen spillover is crucial to preventing and managing disease emergence in pollinators, with far-reaching effects on our food security, ecosystem services and biodiversity. We argue that it is crucial to prevent the introduction of diseased pollinators into natural environments, which can be achieved through improved monitoring and management practices.","2015","2022-11-02 15:32:10","2022-11-02T15:32:10Z",NA,"331–340","","2",52,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Anthropogenic; Biological risk factors; Emerging disease; Infection; Multihost pathogens; Niche overlap; Pollination; Pollinators; RNA viruses; Transmission","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent colony losses have thus raised concerns; possible explanations for bee decline include nutritional deficiencies and exposures to pesticides and pathogens. We determined that constituents found in honey, including p-coumaric acid, pinocembrin, and pinobanksin 5-methyl ether, specifically induce detoxification genes. These inducers are primarily found not in nectar but in pollen in the case of p-coumaric acid (a monomer of sporopollenin, the principal constituent of pollen cell walls) and propolis, a resinous material gathered and processed by bees to line wax cells. RNA-seq analysis (massively parallel RNA sequencing) revealed that p-coumaric acid specifically up-regulates all classes of detoxification genes as well as select antimicrobial peptide genes. This up-regulation has functional significance in that that adding p-coumaric acid to a diet of sucrose increases midgut metabolism of coumaphos, a widely used in-hive acaricide, by ∼60%. As a major component of pollen grains, p-coumaric acid is ubiquitous in the natural diet of honey bees and may function as a nutraceutical regulating immune and detoxification processes. The widespread apicultural use of honey substitutes, including high-fructose corn syrup, may thus compromise the ability of honey bees to cope with pesticides and pathogens and contribute to colony losses.","2013","2022-11-02 15:32:08","2022-11-02T15:32:08Z",NA,"8842–8846","","22",110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With a large dataset of wild bee and butterfly abundances collected across Europe, we first tested the effect of habitat area and connectivity on evenness in pollinator communities using a large array of indexes that give different weight to dominance and rarity. Second, we tested if traits related to mobility and diet breadth could explain the observed evenness patterns. We found a clear negative effect of area and a weaker, but positive effect of connectivity on evenness. Communities in small habitat fragments were mainly composed of mobile and generalist species. The higher evenness in small fragments could thereby be generated by highly mobile species that maintain local populations with frequent inter-fragment movements. Trait analysis suggested an increasing importance of dispersal over local recruitment, as we move from large to small fragments and from less to more connected fragments. Species richness and evenness were negatively correlated indicating that the two variables responded differently to habitat area and connectivity, although the mechanisms underlying the observed patterns are difficult to isolate. Even though habitat area and connectivity often decrease simultaneously due to habitat fragmentation, an interesting practical implication of the contrasting effect of the two variables is that the resulting community composition will depend on the relative strength of these two processes. © 2013 The Authors.","2014","2022-11-02 15:32:04","2022-11-02T15:32:04Z",NA,"544–551","","6",37,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Observations in the field and using a captive bee hive were used to investigate competition between bees and wasps feeding on honeydew. In laboratory trials, interference competition was often strong, and many cases of aggression were noted. In the forest, there was invariably enough room on the trees for bees and wasps to feed while rarely encountering one another. Over the whole year, environmental variables (especially low temperatures and rain), were found to constrain honey bee foraging to a greater degree than competition with wasps. Because the competition that did occur was primarily exploitation competition, reciprocal effects were likely to be felt. At Coopers Creek, bees may be reducing wasp densities, compared with the situation in Nelson - Marlborough where commercial hives are scarce. It may be possible to reduce wasp densities locally by increasing the number of bee hives in an area.","1993","2022-11-02 15:32:02","2022-11-02T15:32:02Z",NA,"85–93","","2",17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Much attention to declining populations has focused on how changing climate drives phenological mismatches between animals and their food(4-6). Effects of climate on plant communities may provide an alternative, but particularly powerful, influence on animal populations because plants provide their habitats. Here, we show that abundances of deciduous trees and associated songbirds have declined with decreasing snowfall over 22 years of study in montane Arizona, USA. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that declining snowfall indirectly influences plants and associated birds by allowing greater over-winter herbivory by elk (Cervus canadensis). We excluded elk from one of two paired snowmelt drainages (10 ha per drainage), and replicated this paired experiment across three distant canyons. Over six years, we reversed multi-decade declines in plant and bird populations by experimentally inhibiting heavy winter herbivory associated with declining snowfall. Moreover, predation rates on songbird nests decreased in exclosures, despite higher abundances of nest predators, demonstrating the over-riding importance of habitat quality to avian recruitment. Thus, our results suggest that climate impacts on plant-animal interactions can have forceful ramifying effects on plants, birds, and ecological interactions.","2012","2022-11-02 15:31:56","2022-11-02T15:31:56Z",NA,"195–200","","3",2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The beneficials with the highest numbers caught during the three years were Anthocoridae, Hymenoptera and Aranea were the first, second and third most representative groups of beneficial arthropods during the three years.","2008","2022-11-02 15:31:53","2022-11-02T15:31:53Z",NA,"29–33","","2",31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; beneficial arthropods; gmo","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the production of many crops benefits from pollination by bees, little is known about bee abundance in urban community gardens or which crops are specifically dependent on bee pollination. In 2005, we compiled a list of crop plants grown within 19 community gardens in New York City and classified these plants according to their dependence on bee pollination. In addition, using mark-recapture methods, we estimated the abundance of a potentially important pollinator within New York City urban gardens, the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens). This species is currently recognized as a valuable commercial pollinator of greenhouse crops. However, wild populations of B. impatiens are abundant throughout its range, including in New York City community gardens, where it is the most abundant native bee species present and where it has been observed visiting a variety of crop flowers. We conservatively counted 25 species of crop plants in 19 surveyed gardens. The literature suggests that 92% of these crops are dependent, to some degree, on bee pollination in order to set fruit or seed. Bombus impatiens workers were observed visiting flowers of 78% of these pollination-dependent crops. Estimates of the number of B. impatiens workers visiting individual gardens during the study period ranged from 3 to 15 bees per 100 m2 of total garden area and 6 to 29 bees per 100 m2 of garden floral area. Of 229 B. impatiens workers marked, all recaptured individuals (45%) were found in gardens where they were initially marked. These results indicate an abundance of B. impatiens workers within New York City community gardens and suggest that, at least for certain time periods, many individual workers forage within single gardens. Both findings suggest that B. impatiens may be an especially important pollinator of several common crops grown within community gardens and other urban green spaces that are used for agricultural production. Studies of other pollinating insect species in urban habitats as well as the relationship between pollen movement and seed or fruit set will complement the findings of this study.","2016","2022-11-02 15:31:50","2022-11-02T15:31:50Z",NA,"1–12","","1",2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Quantitative reviews of existing studies are crucial for better gauging risks and improving future risk assessments. To encourage evidence-based risk analyses, we constructed a searchable database for nontarget effects of Bt crops. A meta-analysis of 42 field experiments indicates that nontarget invertebrates are generally more abundant in Bt cotton and Bt maize fields than in nontransgenic fields managed with insecticides. However, in comparison with insecticide-free control fields, certain nontarget taxa are less abundant in Bt fields.","2007","2022-11-02 15:31:48","2022-11-02T15:31:48Z",NA,"1475–1477","","5830",316,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study was conducted at two adjacent BIOTA biodiversity observatories (\textlessurl\textgreaterwww.biota-africa.org\textless/url\textgreater) in Namaqualand, South Africa. Individuals of certain plant species of the family of Aizoaceae were measured and flower and fruit production recorded. Malaise traps and transect walks were used to document insect diversity. Preliminary results indicate that not all plant species show reduced flower production but that fruit set is indeed compromised on overgrazed land. Insect diversity and abundance is partially reduced under heavy grazing pressure, especially in locations where the vegetation cover is low and dominated by unpalatable plant species.","2004","2022-11-02 15:31:45","2022-11-02T15:31:45Z",NA,"95–103","","01",24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The transformation of agriculture in the past half-century has triggered a decline in bees and other insect pollinators. In North America, losses of bee colonies have accelerated since 2004, leaving the continent with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the past 50 years. A number of factors linked to industrial modes of agriculture affect bee colonies and other pollinators around the world, ranging from habitat degradation due to monocultures with consequent declines in flowering plants and the use of damaging insecticides. Incentives should be offered to farmers to restore pollinator-friendly habitats, including flower provisioning within or around crop fields and elimination of use of insecticides by adopting agroecological production methods. Conventional farmers should be extremely cautious in the choice, timing, and application of insecticides and other chemicals. Here, we review the literature providing mounting evidence that the restoration of plant biodiversity within and around crop fields can improve habitat for domestic and wild bees as well as other insects and thus enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Main findings are the following: (1) certain weed species within crop fields that provide food resources and refuge should be maintained at tolerable levels within crop fields to aid in the survival of viable populations of pollinators. (2) Careful manipulation strategies need to be defined in order to avoid weed competition with crops and interference with certain cultural practices. Economic thresholds of weed populations, as well as factors affecting crop-weed balance within a crop season, need to be defined for specific cropping systems. (3) More research is warranted to advance knowledge on identifying beneficial weed species and ways to sponsor them to attract pollinators while not reducing yields through interference. (4) In areas of intensive farming, field margins, field edges and paths, headlands, fence-lines, rights of way, and nearby uncultivated patches of land are important refuges for many pollinators. (5) Maintenance and restoration of hedgerows and other vegetation features at field borders is therefore essential for harboring pollinators. (6) Appropriate management of non-cropped areas to encourage wild pollinators may prove to be a cost-effective means of maximizing crop yield.","2012","2022-11-02 15:27:34","2022-11-02T15:27:34Z",NA,"257–274","","2",33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Multiple factors such as Varroa destructor, bee viruses, Nosema ceranae, weather, beekeeping practices, nutrition, and pesticides have been shown to contribute to colony losses. Here we describe a large-scale controlled trial, in which different bee pathogens, bee population, and weather conditions across winter were monitored at three locations across the USA. In order to minimize influence of various known contributing factors and their interaction, the hives in the study were not treated with antibiotics or miticides. Additionally, the hives were kept at one location and were not exposed to potential stress factors associated with migration. Our results show that a linear association between load of viruses (DWV or IAPV) in Varroa and bees is present at high Varroa infestation levels (\textgreater3 mites per 100 bees). The collection of comprehensive data allowed us to draw a predictive model of colony losses and to show that Varroa destructor, along with bee viruses, mainly DWV replication, contributes to approximately 70% of colony losses. This correlation further supports the claim that insufficient control of the virus-vectoring Varroa mite would result in increased hive loss. The predictive model also indicates that a single factor may not be sufficient to trigger colony losses, whereas a combination of stressors appears to impact hive health.

Models investigating impacts of habitat fragmentation on pollen flow have categorized landscapes simply in terms of habitat and nonhabitat. We show that pollen flow depends strongly on types of land use between habitat fragments. We used paternity analysis of seeds and a combination of circuit and general linear models to analyze pollen flow for the endangered tree Gomortega keule (Gomortegaceae) [12] in the fragmented Central Chile Biodiversity Hotspot [13]. Pollination probability was highest over pine plantation, moderate over low-intensity agriculture and native forest, and lowest over clearfells. Changing the proportions of the land uses over one kilometer altered pollination probability up to 7-fold. We explain our results by the novel ""Circe principle."" In contrast to models where land uses similar to native habitat promote pollinator movement, pollinators may actually be waylaid in resource-rich areas between habitat patches. Moreover, pollinators may move with higher probability between habitat patches separated by some resource-poor land uses. Pollination research in fragmented landscapes requires explicit recognition of the nature of the nonhabitat matrix, rather than applying simple binary landscape models.","2011","2022-11-02 15:27:31","2022-11-02T15:27:31Z",NA,"1302–1307","","15",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; biodiversity; connectivity; ecosystems; endangered chilean tree; genetics; gomortega-keule; organisms; plant; pollen flow; populations","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been argued that the greater number of plant species is usually caused by a high number of alien plants promoted by human influence. We analysed native and naturalized vascular plant species distribution data from a comprehensive German database comparing city and non-city grid cells of 10 minutes latitude × 6 minutes longitude (c. 130 km2). The number of city grid cells (n = 68) and non-city grid cells (n = 1856) differed by two orders of magnitude and species richness was highly autocorrelated. We therefore used resampling techniques. We resampled the species richness of 68 randomly selected grid cells 9999 times. This showed that not only naturalized alien but also native plant species richness was significantly higher in city grid cells. To relate environmental variables to species richness, we used 10,000 analyses of covariance of 68 city grid cells and 68 randomly selected non city grid cells. We demonstrated that a large proportion of the higher native plant species richness could be explained by the number of geological types per grid cell (i.e. a measure of natural geological diversity). Additionally, we showed by resampling the number of geological types per grid cell that cities are not randomly distributed but are in fact in areas of high geological diversity. Hence, we conclude that city areas are preferentially located in pre-existing biodiversity hotspots and argue that they are species rich not because of but in spite of urbanization.","2004","2022-11-02 15:27:29","2022-11-02T15:27:29Z",NA,"16","","June",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 7516999",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; alien plants; environmen; environmental correlates; environmental heterogeneity; native plants; resampling methods; species richness; urbanization","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, to date, few studies have evaluated how human impacts vary in direction and magnitude across a heterogeneous urban landscape. In this study, we assessed the distribution of floral resources and flower?visiting insects across a variety of land uses in New York City. We visited both green spaces (e.g. parks, cemeteries) and heavily developed neighborhood blocks (e.g. with high or low density residential zoning) and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of median income, vegetation, and development intensity on floral resources and insects in both settings. Abundance and taxonomic richness of flower?visiting insects was significantly greater in green spaces than neighborhood blocks. The SEM results indicated that heavily?developed neighborhoods generally had fewer flower?visiting insects consistent with reductions in floral resources. However, some low?density residential neighborhoods maintained high levels of floral resources and flower?visiting insects. We found that the effects of surrounding vegetation on floral resources, and thus indirect effects on insects, varied considerably between green spaces and neighborhood blocks. Along neighborhood blocks, vegetation consisted of a mosaic of open gardens and sparsely distributed trees and had a positive indirect effect on flower?visiting insects. In contrast, vegetation in urban green spaces was associated with increased canopy cover and thus had a negative indirect effect on flower?visiting insects through reductions in floral resources. In both neighborhood blocks and green spaces, vegetation had a positive direct effect on flower?visiting insects independent of the influence of vegetation on floral resources. Our results demonstrate how inter?related components of an urban ecosystem can vary with respect to one another across a heterogeneous urban landscape, suggesting that it is inappropriate to generalize about urban systems as a whole without first addressing differences among component land use types.","2012","2022-11-02 15:27:29","2022-11-02T15:27:29Z",NA,"682–694","","5",122,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used agroforestry systems differing in land-use intensity to examine flower-visiting bees on coffee plants and the community structure of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies. The number and abundance of all species of coffee-visiting bees did not show a significant correlation with land-use intensity. The abundance (but not the number of species) of solitary bees increased with land-use intensity, whereas the abundance and number of species of social bees significantly decreased. In a further experiment, abundance and number of trap-nesting species increased with land-use intensity. These results contrast with the common expectation that intensively used agroforestry systems are characterized only by loss of species. Furthermore, they support the idea that many nonpest and beneficial insect species may even profit from agricultural land use.

Moths (Lepidoptera) are the major nocturnal pollinators of flowers. However, their importance and contribution to the provision of pollination ecosystem services may have been under-appreciated. Evidence was identified that moths are important pollinators of a diverse range of plant species in diverse ecosystems across the world. 2. Moth populations are known to be undergoing significant declines in several European countries. Among the potential drivers of this decline is increasing light pollution. The known and possible effects of artificial night lighting upon moths were reviewed, and suggest how artificial night lighting might in turn affect the provision of pollination by moths. The need for studies of the effects of artificial night lighting upon whole communities of moths was highlighted. 3. An ecological network approach is one valuable method to consider the effects of artificial night lighting upon the provision of pollination by moths, as it provides useful insights into ecosystem functioning and stability, and may help elucidate the indirect effects of artificial light upon communities of moths and the plants they pollinate. 4. It was concluded that nocturnal pollination is an ecosystem process that may potentially be disrupted by increasing light pollution, although the nature of this disruption remains to be tested. © 2014 The Authors.","2015","2022-11-02 15:27:27","2022-11-02T15:27:27Z",NA,"187–198","","3",40,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agro-ecosystems; Artificial night lighting; Ecological networks; Ecosystem services; Flowering plants; Food-webs; Moths; Population declines","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While honey bee populations in North America and Europe are in decline, little is known about the status of honey bee populations in Africa. We initiated a nationwide survey encompassing 24 locations across Kenya in 2010 to evaluate the numbers and sizes of honey bee colonies, assess the presence of parasites (Varroa mites and Nosema microsporidia) and viruses, identify and quantify pesticide contaminants in hives, and assay for levels of hygienic behavior. Varroa mites were present throughout Kenya, except in the remote north. Levels of Varroa were positively correlated with elevation, suggesting that environmental factors may play a role in honey bee host-parasite interactions. Levels of Varroa were negatively correlated with levels of hygienic behavior: however, while Varroa infestation dramatically reduces honey bee colony survival in the US and Europe, in Kenya Varroa presence alone does not appear to impact colony size. Nosema apis was found at three sites along the coast and one interior site. Only a small number of pesticides at low concentrations were found. Of the seven common US/European honey bee viruses, only three were identified but, like Varroa, were absent from northern Kenya. The number of viruses present was positively correlated with Varroa levels, but was not correlated with colony size or hygienic behavior. Our results suggest that Varroa, the three viruses, and Nosema have been relatively recently introduced into Kenya, but these factors do not yet appear to be impacting Kenyan bee populations. Thus chemical control for Varroa and Nosema are not necessary for Kenyan bees at this time. This study provides baseline data for future analyses of the possible mechanisms underlying resistance to and the long-term impacts of these factors on African bee populations.©2014 Muli et al.","2014","2022-11-02 15:27:21","2022-11-02T15:27:21Z",NA,"e94459","","4",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Africa; Kenya; Nosema; Varroa; animal behavior; article; host parasite interaction; hygiene; nonhuman; organism colony; parasite control; parasite identification; parasite migration; population abundance; survival rate; varroosis","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Abstract Many bumblebee species are declining at a rapid rate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. This is commonly attributed to the decline in floral resources that has resulted from an intensification in farming prac-tices. Here we assess growth of nests of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, in habitats providing different levels of floral resources. Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland with flower-rich conservation measures and in suburban areas. Nests gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in suburban areas compared to elsewhere. The di-versity of pollens gathered by bees was highest in subur-ban areas, and lowest in conventional farmland. Nests in suburban areas were also more prone to attack by the specialist bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggest-ing that this moth is more abundant in suburban areas than elsewhere. Overall, our results demonstrate that gar-dens provide a greater density and diversity of floral re-sources than farmland, and probably support larger pop-ulations of B. terrestris. Contrary to expectation, schemes deployed to enhance farmland biodiversity ap-pear to have little measurable impact on nest growth of this bumblebee species. We argue that B. terrestris prob-ably forage over a larger scale than that on which farms are managed, so that nest growth is determined by the management of a large number of neighbouring farms, not just that in which the nest is located.","2013","2022-11-02 15:27:15","2022-11-02T15:27:15Z",NA,"267–273","","2",130,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

All species gathered nectar from a broader range of flowers than they did pollen, and longer-tongued bees had a narrower diet breadth when collecting nectar. B. hortorum (the species with the longest tongue) specialized on Trifolium pratense. As predicted, abundant species had a broader diet than rare species. Species with similar-length tongues visiting similar flowers. However, interspecific competition did not appear to be important since species with similar tongue lengths and high niche overlap co-occurred at high abundance.

Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.","2006","2022-11-02 15:27:12","2022-11-02T15:27:12Z",NA,"13890–13895","","37",103,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies include field visits to sites where bee mortality is recorded, examination of dead bees for disease, and analysis for the presence of pesticide residues. This paper reviews the results of these investigations for the period 1981-1991. Pesticide poisoning is diagnosed from the detection of residues in dead bees, through interpretation in relation to the median lethal dose (LD50), and 'subsequent residue level' (SRL) determined from laboratory studies in which bees were exposed to one LD50 dose. Overall, an annual average of 50 incidents were confirmed as due to pesticide poisoning, involving 30 pesticide active ingredients during the 1981-1991 period. In England and Wales, the principal hazards were caused by misuse of the insecticide triazophos on oilseed rape, a problem that has been reduced to low levels during the 1980s, and by dimethoate use on a variety of arable crops. In Scotland there were fewer incidents, most of which were associated with use of fenitrothion on raspberries, and gamma-HCH on oilseed rape. Opportunities for reducing the risks of poisoning, and for refining the investigation of suspected incidents, are discussed. © 1994.","1994","2022-11-02 15:27:11","2022-11-02T15:27:11Z",NA,"567–581","","8",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; honeybees; pesticides; poisoning","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

None of the resource availability treatments had a significant effect, while number of mature pods and yield increased non-linearly with pollination intensity up to 200% of current yield levels. The largest benefits were reached by increasing pollination from 10% to 40%, with non-significant increases beyond that level. Despite an increase of fruit abortion with pollination intensity, T. cacao yield is determined, at least on the short term, by the number of flowers pollinated.

However, most studies have focused on high latitudes, with only a few focused on the response of biota to the last glacial maximum (LGM) in equatorial regions. Here, we examine how population sizes of key bee fauna in the southwest Pacific archipelagos of Fiji, Vanuatu and Samoa have fluctuated over the Quaternary. We show that all three island faunas suffered massive population declines, roughly corresponding in time to the LGM, followed by rapid expansion post-LGM. Our data therefore suggest that Pleistocene climate change has had major impacts across a very broad tropical region. While other studies indicate widespread Holarctic effects of the LGM, our data suggest a much wider range of latitudes, extending to the tropics, where these climate change repercussions were important. As key pollinators, the inferred changes in these bee faunas may have been critical in the development of the diverse Pacific island flora. The magnitude of these responses indicates future climate change scenarios may have alarming consequences for Pacific island systems involving pollinator-dependent plant communities and agricultural crops. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We examined the contribution of three different habitat types (farmland, forest edge, forest understory) to bee diversity in a tropical forest-agriculture mosaic in Western Kenya and analysed differences and overlap in plant-bee community interactions between nearby habitats. We used network properties (network size and specialization indices) and bee species turnover to examine temporal and spatial variation of flower-visitation interaction networks in general and in bee species composition in detail across habitats. In total we found 121 bee and 89 plant species involved in the interactions. Results suggest that bees were limited by floral resources because the largest networks, highest diversity, and largest abundances were found at the forest edge and in the farmland which hosted higher amounts of flowers and a more homogeneous distribution of resources in space and time. Forest in the study area is characterized by (1) lower flower density and (2) more humid conditions relative to the farmland. We therefore suggest that the species-rich and structurally diverse farmland acts as a "" pollinator rescue"" which supports bee communities in the natural forest.

Landscape-scale disturbance results in two often inter-related processes: (1) habitat loss, (2) disruptions of habitat configuration (i.e. fragmentation). Understanding the relative effects of such processes is critical in designing effective management strategies to limit pollination and pollinator decline. We reviewed existing published work from 1989 to 2009 and found that only six of 303 studies considering the influence of landscape context on pollination separated the effects of habitat loss from fragmentation. We provide a synthesis of the current landscape, behavioural, and pollination ecology literature in order to present preliminary multiple working hypotheses explaining how these two landscape processes might independently influence pollination dynamics. Landscape disturbance primarily influences three components of pollination interactions: pollinator density, movement, and plant demography. We argue that effects of habitat loss on each of these components are likely to differ substantially from the effects of fragmentation, which is likely to be more complex and may influence each pollination component in contrasting ways. The interdependency between plants and animals inherent to pollination systems also has the possibility to drive cumulative effects of fragmentation, initiating negative feedback loops between animals and the plants they pollinate. Alternatively, due to their asymmetrical structure, pollination networks may be relatively robust to fragmentation. Despite the potential importance of independent effects of habitat fragmentation, its effects on pollination remain largely untested. We postulate that variation across studies in the effects of 'fragmentation' owes much to artifacts of the sampling regimes adopted, particularly (1) incorrectly separating fragmentation from habitat loss, and (2) mis-matches in spatial scale between landscapes studied and the ecological processes of interest. The field of landscape pollination ecology could be greatly advanced through the consideration and quantification of the matrix, landscape functional connectivity, and pollinator movement behaviour in response to these elements.

We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales.There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation.Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2012","2022-11-02 15:27:05","2022-11-02T15:27:05Z",NA,"89–210","","",46,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increasing crop genetic diversity has shown to be useful in pest and disease management, and has the potential to enhance pollination services and soil processes in specific situations.

Two species, Tetragonula carbonaria and Austroplebeia australis, dominated the relatively short list of species kept. There was a high demand for Australian stingless bee colonies and their honey, but with less than 250 bee keepers currently propagating colonies, and many of them on a small scale, it is difficult to meet this demand.

The management and removal of invasive species may give rise to unanticipated changes in plant–pollinator mutualisms because they can alter the composition and functioning of plant–pollinator interactions in a variety of ways. To utilize a functional approach for inva- sive species management, we examined the restoration of plant–pollinator mutualisms follow- ing the large-scale removal of an invasive nectar thief and arthropod predator, Vespula pensylvanica. 2. We reduced V. pensylvanica populations in large plots managed over multiple years to examine the response of plant–pollinator mutualisms and the fruit production of a function- ally important endemic Hawaiian tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha. To integrate knowl- edge of the invader's behaviour and the plant's mating system, we determined the efficacy of V. pensylvanica as a pollinator of M. polymorpha and quantified the dependence of M. poly- morpha on animal pollination (e.g. level of self-compatibility and pollen limitation). 3. The reduction of V. pensylvanica in managed sites, when compared to unmanaged sites, resulted in a significant increase in the visitation rates of effective bee pollinators (e.g. intro- duced Apis mellifera and native Hylaeus spp.) and in the fruit production of M. polymorpha. 4. Apis mellifera, following the management of V. pensylvanica, appears to be acting as a substitute pollinator for M. polymorpha, replacing extinct or threatened bird and bee species in our study system. 5. Synthesis and applications. Fruit production of the native M. polymorpha was increased after management of the invasive pollinator predator V. pensylvanica; however, the main poll- inators were no longer native but introduced. This research thus demonstrates the diverse impacts of introduced species on ecological function and the ambiguous role they play in res- toration. We recommend incorporating ecological function and context into invasive species management as this approach may enable conservation managers to simultaneously minimize the negative and maximize the positive impacts (e.g. taxon substitution) of introduced species. Such novel restoration approaches are needed, especially in highly degraded ecosystems.","2013","2022-11-02 15:27:02","2022-11-02T15:27:02Z",NA,"147–155","","1",50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apis; Ecosystem function; Honeybee; Interaction; Metrosideros; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Taxon substitution; Vespula","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(Lepidoptera: Danaidae) larvae. Larvae feeding for 48 h on A. syriaca plants naturally dusted with pollen from Bt corn plants suffered significantly higher rates of mortality at 48 h (20±3%) compared to larvae feeding on leaves with no pollen (3±3%), or feeding on leaves with non-Bt pollen (0%). Mortality at 120 h of D. plexippus larvae exposed to 135 pollen grains/cm(2) of transgenic pollen for 48 h ranged from 37 to 70%. We found no sub-lethal effects on D. plexippus adults reared from larvae that survived a 48-h exposure to three concentrations of Bt pollen. Based on our quantification of the wind dispersal of this pollen beyond the edges of agricultural fields, we predict that the effects of transgenic pollen on D. plexippus may be observed at least 10 m from transgenic field borders. However, the highest larval mortality will likely occur on A. syriaca plants in corn fields or within 3 m of the edge of a transgenic corn field. We conclude that the ecological effects of transgenic insecticidal crops need to be evaluated more fully before they are planted over extensive areas.","2000","2022-11-02 15:27:01","2022-11-02T15:27:01Z",NA,"241–248","","2",125,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bt corn; Danaus plexippus; Risk assessment; Transgenic pollen","/unread",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere.

Although its biosynthesis from thyroid hormone (TH) precursors appears likely, the sequence and sites of reactions are still controversial: studies in L-thyroxine (T4)-substituted thyroid cancer patients lacking functional thyroid tissue suggested extrathyroidal 3-T1AM production, while studies using labeled T4 in mice indicated intrathyroidal formation. However, as the patients received T4 orally whereas the mice were injected intraperitoneally, we hypothesized that 3-T1AM synthesis requires the intestinal passage of T4. Using the everted gut sac model in combination with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate 3-T1AM production from T4 in mouse intestine via several deiodination and decarboxylation steps. Gene expression analysis confirmed the expression of all 3 deiodinases as well as ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in intestine. Subsequent experiments employing purified human ODC revealed that this enzyme can in fact mediate decarboxylation of 3,5-T2 and T4 to the respective TAMs, demonstrating that the intestine expresses the entire molecular machinery required for 3-T1AM biosynthesis. Interestingly, TAM production was strongly affected by the antithyroid treatment methimazole and perchlorate independently of thyroid status, limiting the validity of the respective mouse models in this context. Taken together, our data demonstrate intestinal 3-T1AM biosynthesis from T4 involving decarboxylation through ODC with subsequent deiodination, and explain the apparent discrepancy between 3-T1AM serum levels in patients substituted orally and mice injected intraperitoneally with T4. Identifying ODC as the first enzyme capable of decarboxylating TH, our findings open the path to further investigations of TAM metabolism on molecular and cellular levels.","2000","2022-11-02 15:23:00","2022-11-02T15:23:00Z",NA,"325–335","","4",20,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 26348473",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They commonly encounter insecticides, and the effects of insecticides on honey bees have been frequently noted. It has been suggested that honey bees may be (as a species) uniquely sensitive to insecticides, although no comparative toxicology study has been undertaken to examine this claim. An extensive literature review was conducted, using data in which adult insects were topically treated with insecticides. The goal of this review was to summarize insecticide toxicity data between A. mellifera and other insects to determine the relative sensitivity of honey bees to insecticides.","2010","2022-11-02 15:23:00","2022-11-02T15:23:00Z",NA,"1171–1180","","11",66,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Carbamate; Comparative toxicology; Neonicotinoid; Organophosphate; Pyrethroid","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To test this, we established twenty-four 100 m2 plots in a tallgrass prairie in Galveston County, Texas, in spring 2000. Plots were assigned a fire (no burn, one time burn [2000], two time burn [2000, 2001]) and fertilization treatment (none, NPK addition) in a full factorial design. Fertilization treatments allowed us to examine the effects of fire at a different level of productivity. We measured plant cover by species and sampled arthropods with sweep nets during the 2001 growing season. Path analysis indicated that fertilization reduced while annual fires increased arthropod diversity via increases and decreases in woody plant abundance, respectively. There was no direct effect of fire on arthropod diversity or abundance. Diptera and Homoptera exhibited particularly strong positive responses to fires. Lepidoptera had a negative response to nutrient enrichment. Overall, the negative effects of fire on the arthropod community were minor in contrast to the strong positive indirect effects of small-scale burning on arthropod diversity if conservation of particular taxa is not a priority. The same fire regime that minimized woody plant invasion also maximized arthropod diversity.

Many factors have been evoked to explain the losses, among which are the presence of residues of pesticides and veterinary products in hives. Multiple residues are present at the same time, though most often in low concentrations so that no single product has yet been associated with losses. Involvement of a combination of residues to losses may however not be excluded. To understand the impact of an exposure to combined residues on honey bees, we propose a mechanism-based strategy, focusing here on Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) transporters as mediators of those interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using whole-animal bioassays, we demonstrate through inhibition by verapamil that the widely used organophosphate and pyrethroid acaricides coumaphos and τ-fluvalinate, and three neonicotinoid insecticides: imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiacloprid are substrates of one or more MDR transporters. Among the candidate inhibitors of honey bee MDR transporters is the in-hive antibiotic oxytetracycline. Bees prefed oxytetracycline were significantly sensitized to the acaricides coumaphos and τ-fluvalinate, suggesting that the antibiotic may interfere with the normal excretion or metabolism of these pesticides. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Many bee hives receive regular treatments of oxytetracycline and acaricides for prevention and treatment of disease and parasites. Our results suggest that seasonal co-application of these medicines to bee hives could increase the adverse effects of these and perhaps other pesticides. Our results also demonstrate the utility of a mechanism-based strategy. By identifying pesticides and apicultural medicines that are substrates and inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters we prioritize the testing of those chemical combinations most likely to result in adverse interactions.","2011","2022-11-02 15:22:58","2022-11-02T15:22:58Z",NA,"","","11",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite this, there is still limited knowledge of how elevated temperatures affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and how changed availability of mutualistic partners influences the persistence of interacting species. Here we review the evidence of climate warming effects on plants and pollinators and discuss how their interactions may be affected by increased temperatures. The onset of flowering in plants and first appearance dates of pollinators in several cases appear to advance linearly in response to recent temperature increases. Phenological responses to climate warming may therefore occur at parallel magnitudes in plants and pollinators, although considerable variation in responses across species should be expected. Despite the overall similarities in responses, a few studies have shown that climate warming may generate temporal mismatches among the mutualistic partners. Mismatches in pollination interactions are still rarely explored and their demographic consequences are largely unknown. Studies on multi-species plant-pollinator assemblages indicate that the overall structure of pollination networks probably are robust against perturbations caused by climate warming. We suggest potential ways of studying warming-caused mismatches and their consequences for plant-pollinator interactions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of such approaches. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","2009-02","2022-11-02 15:22:56","2022-11-02T15:22:56Z",NA,"184–195","","2",12,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Abundance; Climate warming; Distribution; Global change; Interaction; Mismatch; Mutualism; Network; Phenology; Pollination","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, biosafety research on genetically modified crops rarely considers effects on nurse bees from intact colonies, even though they receive and primarily process the largest amount of pollen. The objective of this study was to analyze the response of nurse bees and their gut bacteria to pollen from Bt maize expressing three different insecticidal Cry proteins (Cry1A.105, Cry2Ab2, and Cry3Bb1). Naturally Cry proteins are produced by bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis). Colonies of Apis mellifera carnica were kept during anthesis in flight cages on field plots with the Bt maize, two different conventionally bred maize varieties, and without cages, 1-km outside of the experimental maize field to allow ad libitum foraging to mixed pollen sources. During their 10-days life span, the consumption of Bt maize pollen had no effect on their survival rate, body weight and rates of pollen digestion compared to the conventional maize varieties. As indicated by ELISA-quantification of Cry1A.105 and Cry3Bb1, more than 98% of the recombinant proteins were degraded. Bacterial population sizes in the gut were not affected by the genetic modification. Bt-maize, conventional varieties and mixed pollen sources selected for significantly different bacterial communities which were, however, composed of the same dominant members, including Proteobacteria in the midgut and Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. in the hindgut. Surprisingly, Cry proteins from natural sources, most likely B. thuringiensis, were detected in bees with no exposure to Bt maize. The natural occurrence of Cry proteins and the lack of detectable effects on nurse bees and their gut bacteria give no indication for harmful effects of this Bt maize on nurse honey bees. © 2013 Hendriksma et al.","2013","2022-11-02 15:22:54","2022-11-02T15:22:54Z",NA,"3","","3",8,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Michener, the world's leading authority on bee systematics, The Bees of the World is the only comprehensive, worldwide treatment of all groups of bees – 1,200 genera and subgenera, including more than 16,000 species. In extensive introductory sections, Michener examines the evolution of bees from wasps, the relations of the families of bees to one another, the evolution of bees in relation to that of flowering plants, the nesting behavior of solitary and social bees, and the structure of immature and adult bees. Drawing on these considerations as well as the fossil record, he speculates on the attributes of the protobee, the common ancestor of all bees. He also cites the major literature on bee biology and describes the need for further research on the systematics and natural history of bees, including their importance as pollinators of crops and natural vegetation. The greater part of the work consists of an unprecedented treatment of bee systematics, with keys (many of them regional) for identification to the subgenus level. For each genus or subgenus, Michener includes a brief natural history describing geographical range, number of species, and noteworthy information pertaining to nesting or floral biology. The work is beautifully illustrated with 48 color photos of bees, and more than 500 black and white drawings and photographs that depict behavior, detailed morphology, and ecology.""At least since the time of Aristotle people have been interested in bees because they are fascinating creatures. We are social animals; some bees are also social.

The sub-lethal impact of GLY on non-target organisms such as insect pollinators has not yet been evaluated. Apis mellifera is the main pollinator in agricultural environments and is a well-known model for behavioural research. Honeybees are also accurate biosensors of environmental pollutants and their appetitive behavioural response is a suitable tool with which to test sub-lethal effects of agrochemicals. We studied the effects of field-realistic doses of GLY on honeybees exposed chronically or acutely to the herbicide. We focused on sucrose sensitivity, elemental and non-elemental associative olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), and foraging-related behaviour. We found a reduced sensitivity to sucrose and learning performance for the groups chronically exposed to GLY concentrations within the range of recommended doses. When olfactory PER conditioning was performed with sucrose reward with the same GLY concentrations (acute exposure), elemental learning and short-term memory retention decreased significantly compared with controls. Non-elemental associative learning was also impaired by an acute exposure to GLY traces. Altogether, these results imply that GLY at concentrations found in agro-ecosystems as a result of standard spraying can reduce sensitivity to nectar reward and impair associative learning in honeybees. However, no effect on foraging-related behaviour was found. Therefore, we speculate that successful forager bees could become a source of constant inflow of nectar with GLY traces that could then be distributed among nestmates, stored in the hive and have long-term negative consequences on colony performance.","2014","2022-11-02 15:22:51","2022-11-02T15:22:51Z",NA,"3457–3464","","19",217,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25063858",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we combined detailed field observations, molecular approaches and GIS-based quantification of landscape structure (measured by proportions of seminatural habitats and proportions of mass flowering crops) to get new insights into driving forces of population dynamics of the bumblebee species Bombus pascuorum. Comparing 13 agriculturally dominated landscape sectors, we found the proportion of mass flowering crops to positively influence bumblebee abundance whereas the proportion of seminatural habitats was of minor importance. We used microsatellites to quantify landscape-related colony densities, inbreeding and population substructure. Detected colony densities did not correlate with landscape parameters or with local worker abundance, measured by field observations. These results indicate that increased worker abundances within landscapes are rather due to greater colony sizes than due to an increased number of nests. We found significant population substructure, measured by F(ST) and seven landscape sectors to bear significantly increased inbreeding values (F(IS)). F(IS) was strongly varying between sectors but did not correlate with landscape structure. Moreover, F(IS) had a significantly negative effect on colony size, demonstrating the importance of genetic diversity on population fitness at a landscape scale.

Recently in the United States, dramatic honeybee losses (colony collapse disorder) have been reported; however, there remains no clear explanation for these colony losses, with parasitic mites, viruses, bacteria, and fungal diseases all being proposed as possible candidates. Common characteristics that most failing colonies share is a lack of overt disease symptoms and the disappearance of workers from what appears to be normally functioning colonies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to monitor the presence of three honeybee viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV), during a 1-year period in 15 asymptomatic, varroa mite-positive honeybee colonies in Southern England, and 3 asymptomatic colonies confirmed to be varroa mite free. All colonies with varroa mites underwent control treatments to ensure that mite populations remained low throughout the study. Despite this, multiple virus infections were detected, yet a significant correlation was observed only between DWV viral load and overwintering colony losses. The long-held view has been that DWV is relatively harmless to the overall health status of honeybee colonies unless it is in association with severe varroa mite infestations. Our findings suggest that DWV can potentially act independently of varroa mites to bring about colony losses. Therefore, DWV may be a major factor in overwintering colony losses.

Here we apply a social-ecological systems analysis to provide insight into the diverse system interactions that pose impediments to delivery of the Aichi Targets. We applied an analytical framework of pair-wise exchanges along six axes between the social, economic, environmental and political loci of the global social-ecological system. The analysis identified that many impediments result from partial decoupling in the system through phenomena including delayed feedbacks and insufficient information flows. It suggests 15 of the Aichi Targets are unlikely to be delivered; 3 are likely to be delivered in part; and 2 in full. We considered how interventions at leverage points may overcome the impediments, and compared these to actions included within the Implementation Decision for the Aichi Targets, to find gaps. These new leverage points to fill identified gaps involve many aspects of system re-coupling: co-production of knowledge and more equitable food systems governance (environmental-social axis); support for social change movements (social-political axis); an appropriate financial target for biodiversity conservation investment, with a clear means of implementation such as a currency transaction tax (economic-political axis); and co-governance of natural resources (environmental-political axis). The recently released Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 shows that 18 of the 20 Aichi Targets are tracking in accordance with our analysis; and that current efforts are unlikely to result in an improvement in the base state of biodiversity by 2020, confirming some of our results. We argue that attention to the interactions within, and the partial decoupling of, the global social-ecological system provides new insights, and is worthy of further attention both for delivery of the Aichi Targets and for guiding longer term actions for the conservation of biodiversity.","2015","2022-11-02 15:22:44","2022-11-02T15:22:44Z",NA,"22–34","","",34,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Aichi Targets; Biodiversity; Environmentalists' paradox; Political ecology; Power; Social-ecological systems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Copper and Cd had the highest translocation indices, as well as higher bioconcentration factors compared to Pb, which was mostly immobile in the plant.

Agricultural irrigation and runoff solubilizes Se from these shales, causing buildups of toxic levels of selenate (SeO 42-) in water and soil. Our main objective was to investigate the accumulation of Se in two Brassicaceae species chosen for their potential as phytoremediators of Se contaminated soils. We tested the hypothesis that Se will accumulate in the pollen and nectar of two plant species and negatively affect floral traits and plant reproduction. Certain species of Brassicaceae can accumulate high concentrations of Se in their leaf tissues. In this study Se accumulation in plant tissues was investigated under greenhouse conditions. Se accumulator (Brassica juncea) and Se hyperaccumulator (Stanleya pinnata) plants were irrigated in sand culture with 0μM selenate (control), 8μM selenate, and 13μM selenate.Nectar and pollen in S. pinnata contained up to 150μgSemL -1 wet weight and 12900μgSeg -1dry weight when irrigated with 8μM selenate. Se levels in nectar (110μgSemL -1wet weight) and pollen (1700μgSeg -1dry weight) were not as high in B. juncea. Floral display width, petal area and seed pod length were significantly reduced in the 13μM selenate Se treatment in B. juncea. S. pinnata floral traits and seeds were unaffected by the Se treatments.This study provides crucial information about where some of the highest concentrations of Se are found in two phytoremediators, and may shed light on the potential risks pollinators may face when foraging upon these accumulating plants. In the field, duration of the plant's exposure, Se soil and water concentrations as well as other environmental factors may also play important roles in determining how much Se is accumulated into the leaf and floral tissues. Our greenhouse study shed light on two species' ability to accumulate Se, as well as determined the specific plant tissues where Se concentrations are highest. © 2011.","2011","2022-11-02 15:22:41","2022-11-02T15:22:41Z",NA,"90–97","","1",74,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Brassica juncea; Floral traits; Hyperaccumulator; Pollinators; Selenium; Stanleya pinnata","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Se can be biotransferred throughout the food web, but few studies have examined its effects on the insects that feed on Se-accumulating plants, particularly pollinators. In laboratory bioassays, we used proboscis extension reflex (PER) and taste perception to determine if the presence of Se affected the gustatory response of honey bee (Apis mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) foragers. Antennae and proboscises were stimulated with both organic (selenomethionine) and inorganic (selenate) forms of Se that commonly occur in Se-accumulating plants. Methionine was also tested. Each compound was dissolved in 1 M sucrose at 5 concentrations, with sucrose alone as a control. Antennal stimulation with selenomethionine and methionine reduced PER at higher concentrations. Selenate did not reduce gustatory behaviors. Two hours after being fed the treatments, bees were tested for sucrose response threshold. Bees fed selenate responded less to sucrose stimulation. Mortality was higher in bees chronically dosed with selenate compared with a single dose. Selenomethionine did not increase mortality except at the highest concentration. Methionine did not significantly impact survival. Our study has shown that bees fed selenate were less responsive to sucrose, which may lead to a reduction in incoming floral resources needed to support coworkers and larvae in the field. If honey bees forage on nectar containing Se (particularly selenate), reductions in population numbers may occur due to direct toxicity. Given that honey bees are willing to consume food resources containing Se and may not avoid Se compounds in the plant tissues on which they are foraging, they may suffer similar adverse effects as seen in other insect guilds.","2012","2022-11-02 15:22:40","2022-11-02T15:22:40Z",NA,"4","","4",7,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We asked whether these range shifts by birds are clearly consistent with either climate change or land use change being the primary driver. Location South Africa. Methods We categorized recent range changes among 408 South African terrestrial bird species and, using generalized linear mixed models, analysed ecological attributes of those species that have and have not changed their ranges. Results Fifty-six of the 408 taxa studied have undergone significant range shifts. Most extended their ranges towards the south (towards cooler latitudes, consistent with climate-change drivers) or west (towards drier and warmer habitats, inconsistent with climate drivers but consistent with land use drivers); very few moved east or north. Both southward and westward movers were habitat generalists. Furthermore, southward movers were mobile taxa (migrants and nomads), whereas westward movers were associated with human-modified elements in the landscape, such as croplands, plantations or buildings. Main conclusions The results suggest that both land use changes and climate change may simultaneously be influencing dynamic range shifts by South African birds, but separating the relative strengths of these two drivers is challenging, not least because both are operating concurrently and may influence some species simultaneously. Those species that respond to land use change by contracting their ranges are likely to be among the species that will be most impacted by climate change if land use practices with negative impacts are occurring in areas anticipated to become climatic refugia for these species. This highlights a pressing need to develop dynamic models of species potential range shifts and changing abundances that incorporate population and dispersal processes, as well as ecological processes that influence habitat suitability.","2011","2022-11-02 15:22:39","2022-11-02T15:22:39Z",NA,"254–261","","2",17,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Birds; Climate change; Land use; Range change; Range expansion; South Africa","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated the contribution of tropical primary forest, cacao agroforestry systems of varying management practices and openland to the temporal and spatial variation of diversity of native bee communities in the herb layer (Apidae, Hymenoptera) in Sulawesi (Indonesia). Local bee density and diversity were highest in openland, followed by agroforestry systems and were lowest in primary forests, revealing the importance of herbaceous food resources in the understorey. In contrast, highest regional bee richness was found in agroforestry systems, because of high community dissimilarity. Multidimensional scaling supported these findings with openland habitats showing more compactly clustered bee species communities than agroforestry habitats. In conclusion, the herb associated bee community profited from the opening of the landscape as a result of agricultural activities, while agroforestry systems increased bee species richness especially on a regional scale due to high management diversity. © 2010 The Author(s).","2010","2022-11-02 15:22:37","2022-11-02T15:22:37Z",NA,"2189–2200","","8",19,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Additive partitioning; Apidae; Biodiversity; Conservation; Land-use gradient; Pollinator community; Sulawesi","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r2=45%) than did species richness (r2=32%) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.","2008","2022-11-02 15:22:36","2022-11-02T15:22:36Z",NA,"2283–2291","","1648",275,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Complementary resource use; Ecosystem services; Fruit set; Land-use management gradient; Spatio-temporal variability; Tropical ecology","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we assess the spatial distribution and interactions of these primary threats in relation to the global distribution of amphibian species. We show that the greatest proportions of species negatively affected by climate change are projected to be found in Africa, parts of northern South America and the Andes. Regions with the highest projected impact of land-use and climate change coincide, but there is little spatial overlap with regions highly threatened by the fungal disease. Overall, the areas harbouring the richest amphibian faunas are disproportionately more affected by one or multiple threat factors than areas with low richness.

Here we explored the potential for host shift from honeybee, Apis mellifera, colonies to bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, colonies by the small hive beetle, a nest parasite/scavenger native to sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated small hive beetle host choice, bumblebee colony defence as well as individual defensive behaviour of honeybee and bumblebee workers. Our findings show that in its new range in North America, bumblebees are potential alternate hosts for the small hive beetle. We found that small hive beetles do invade bumblebee colonies and readily oviposit there. Honeybee colonies are not preferred over bumblebee colonies. But even though bumblebees lack a co-evolutionary history with the small hive beetle, they are able to defend their colonies against this nest intruder by removal of beetle eggs and larvae and stinging of the latter. Hence, the observed behavioural mechanisms must be part of a generalistic defence system suitable for defence against multiple attackers. Nevertheless, there are quantitative (worker force) and qualitative differences (hygienic behaviour) between A. mellifera and B. impatiens.","2008","2022-11-02 15:22:35","2022-11-02T15:22:35Z",NA,"153–162","","2",55,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Aethina tumida; Bumblebees; Host shift; Invasive species; Parasites","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the vast majority of crops it is unknown whether managed honey bees or wild bees are the most efficient pollinators, and how the pollination service provided by wild bees can be ensured. We assessed in a landscape-scale study how sweet cherry production is influenced (1) by high-diversity bee habitats, and (2) by flowering ground vegetation which might compete with cherry for pollinators or might facilitate cherry pollination. Cherry was highly dependent on insect pollination with bagged flowers producing only 3% of the fruits produced by open-pollinated flowers. Although two thirds of all flower visitors were honey bees, fruit set was related to wild bee visitation only, presumably due to their higher pollination efficiency. Initial fruit set and final cherry yield were closely correlated. Wild bee visitation increased with the proportion of high-diversity bee habitats in the surrounding landscape (1. km radius). An increase of high-diversity bee habitats in the landscape from 20% to 50% enhanced fruit set by 150%, which was experimentally shown to be due to pollen limitation. Neither flower cover of ground vegetation nor bee densities on ground transects were related to flower visitation in trees or fruit set. Our results show that pollination services by wild bees in cherry surpassed pollination by honey bees. Hence, farmers need to protect semi-natural habitats in their landscapes to guarantee pollination and high yields.

We conducted three landscape-scale field studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in a transient dilution of bees in crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant Primula veris, but also pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR. This landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in OSR fields and marginally in grasslands, where bumble-bee abundances were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of Primula veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when the amount of OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent. Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased competition for pollinators between crops and wild plants. In conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the fact that, in the long run, mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service. © 2011 The Royal Society.","2011","2022-11-02 15:22:29","2022-11-02T15:22:29Z",NA,"3444–3451","","",278,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"Soc.

However, urbanization has resulted in entire landscapes that are now occupied by plant communities wholly created by humans, in which diversity may reflect social, economic, and cultural influences in addition to those recognized by traditional ecological theory. Here we use data from a probability-based survey to explore the variation in plant diversity across a large metropolitan area using spatial statistical analyses that incorporate biotic, abiotic, and human variables. Our prediction for the city was that land use, along with distance from urban center, would replace the dominantly geomorphic controls on spatial variation in plant diversity in the surrounding undeveloped Sonoran desert. However, in addition to elevation and current and former land use, family income and housing age best explained the observed variation in plant diversity across the city. We conclude that a functional relationship, which we term the ""luxury effect,"" may link human resource abundance (wealth) and plant diversity in urban ecosystems.

Plant pollination by insects is one of the most well-known and important ecosystem services and is essential in both natural and agricultural landscapes. An estimated 85 percent of the world's flowering plants depend on animals—mostly insects—for pollination (Ollerton et al. 2011). Eighty-seven of the world's 124 most commonly cultivated crops (70 percent) are reliant on animal pollinators, and insect-pollinated forage plants such as alfalfa and clover provide feed for livestock (Klein et al. 2006). Roughly 35 percent of global crop production is dependent on pollination by animals (Klein et al. 2006). Pollinators also sustain wildland plant communities that provide food and shelter for myriad other wildlife and contribute to overall ecosystem health. The great majority of pollinators are insects, including bees, wasps, flies, beetles, butterflies, and moths (Speight 1978; Allen-Wardell et al. 1998; Jennersten 1988; Frankie et al. 1990; Irvine and Armstrong 1990; Kevan 1999; Westerkamp and Gottsberger 2000; Kearns 2001; Larson et al. 2001), but many bird and bat species pollinate as well (Grant 1994; Valiente-Banuet et al. 2004). Bees are considered the most important group of pollinators for agricultural crops as well as for wild plants in temperate climates (Morse and Calderone 2000; Garibaldi et al. 2013). The domesticated European honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) is the most widely managed crop pollinator in the United States. Studies indicate that honey bees are important for more than $15 billion in crop production annually (Morse and Calderone 2000; Calderone 2012). There are also approximately 4,000 species of native bees in North America (Michener 2007), and they are also important crop pollinators (e.g., Tepedino 1981; Bosch and Kemp 2001; Javorek et al. 2002; Winfree et al. 2008; Garibaldi et al. 2013). Native bees are important in the production of an estimated $3 billion worth of crops annually to the United States economy (Losey and Vaughan 2006; Calderone 2012), and emerging research shows that this is likely an underestimate of their total value (Garibaldi et al. 2013). There is evidence of declines in both domesticated and wild pollinators. The number of honey bee colonies has been in decline over the past half-century because of disease, parasites, lack of floral resources, insecticides, and other factors (National Research Council 2007). Since 2006, beekeepers have experienced record high annual hive losses of 29 percent or more (Bee Informed Partnership 2014), and several species of once-common bumble bees have become rare (Cameron et al. 2011). Other pollinators are also in decline. Monarch butterfly populations have dropped by 90 percent east of the rocky mountains (Rendón-Salinas and Tavera-Alonso 2014) and by 50 percent west of the Rockies (Monroe et al. 2014), and other butterfly species have also seen significant declines. NatureServe (a primary source for species conservation data, status, and trends in the United States) has assessed all 800 butterfly species in the United States and has found that 141 (17 percent) are at risk of extinction (NatureServe 2014). Twenty-six species of butterflies are listed as threatened or endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). Factors leading to decline include habitat loss, pesticide use, diseases, parasites, and the spread of invasive species. Threats to pollinator communities affect not only pollinators themselves but also natural ecosystems and agricultural productivity. Threats to pollinators specifically associated with roads include mortality due to vehicle collisions, habitat fragmentation, barriers to movement, effects of roadside vegetation management, exposure to invasive plants, drift from adjacent land, and pollution from vehicles. Despite these threats, roadsides are a conservation opportunity to increase pollinator habitat. Roadsides can provide habitat for a diverse community of pollinators. Roadside habitat can include forage for food and breeding or nesting opportunities. Roadsides extend across a variety of landscapes and can aid dispersal of pollinators by linking fragmented habitats. By acting as refugia for pollinators in otherwise inhospitable landscapes, roadside habitat can contribute to the maintenance of healthy ecosystems and provision of ecological services such as crop pollination services.","2015","2022-11-02 15:22:24","2022-11-02T15:22:24Z",NA,"","68","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"May",NA,NA,"Federal Highway Administration","Washington D.C., USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Richness and abundance of bees were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees.

Although cross-pollination in commercial canola (Brassica napus) fields has been empirically measured, field trials are expensive and do not identify the causes of cross-pollination. Therefore, theoretical models can be valuable because they can provide estimates of cross-pollination at any given site and time. We present a general analytical model of field-to-field gene flow due to the following competing mechanisms: the wind, bees, and autonomous pollination. We parameterize the model for the particular case of field-to-field cross-pollination of genetically modified (GM) canola via the wind and via bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and honey bees (Apis mellifera). We make extensive use of the large data set of bee densities collected during the recent U.K. Farm Scale Evaluations. We predict that canola approaches almost full seed set without pollinators and that autonomous pollination is responsible for \textgreater or = 25% of seed set, irrespective of pollinator abundance. We do not predict the relative contribution of bees vs. the wind in landscape-scale gene flow in canola. However, under model assumptions, we predict that the maximum field-to-field gene flow due to bumble bees is 0.04% and 0.13% below the current EU limit for adventitious GM presence for winter- and spring-sown canola, respectively. We predict that gene flow due to bees is approximately 3.1 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, and due to the wind, 1.3 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, for both winter- and spring-sown canola. Bumble bee-mediated gene flow is approximately 2.7 times higher and wind-mediated gene flow approximately 1.7 times lower in spring-sown than in winter-sown canola, regardless of the degree of male-sterility. The model of cross-pollination due to the wind most closely predicted three previously published observations: field-to-field gene flow is low; gene flow increases with the proportion of plants that are male-sterile; and gene flow is higher in winter- than in spring-sown canola. Our results therefore suggest that the wind, not bees, is the main vector of long-distance gene flow in canola.","2007","2022-11-02 15:22:22","2022-11-02T15:22:22Z",NA,"2123–2135","","7",17,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apis mellifera; Bombus; Brassica napus; Bumble bee; Canola; Gene flow; Genetically modified organisms; Honey bee; Oilseed rape; Pollination","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the clearest and most rapid signals of biological response to rising temperatures across an array of biomes has been shifts in species phenology [2-4], yet to date evidence for phenological responses to climate change has been presented from most biomes except the High Arctic [3]. Given the well-established consequences for population dynamics of shifts in the timing of life history events [5,6], it is essential that the High Arctic be represented in assessments of phenological response to climate change. Using the most comprehensive data set available from this region, we document extremely rapid climate-induced advancement of flowering, emergence and egg-laying in a wide array of species in a high-arctic ecosystem.

Hence, conservationists and bee keepers are debating about the consequences of beekeeping for the conservation of wild bees in nature reserves. We observed flower-visiting bees on flowers of Calluna vulgaris in sites differing in the distance to the next honey-bee hive and in sites with hives present and absent in the Luneburger Heath, Germany. Additionally, we counted wild bee ground nests in sites that differ in their distance to the next hive and wild bee stem nests and stem-nesting bee species in sites with hives present and absent. We did not observe fewer honey bees or higher wild bee flower visits in sites with different distances to the next hive (up to 1,229 m). However, wild bees visited fewer flowers and honey bee visits increased in sites containing honey-bee hives and in sites containing honey-bee hives we found fewer stem-nesting bee species. The reproductive success, measured as number of nests, was not affected by distance to honey-bee hives or their presence but by availability and characteristics of nesting resources. Our results suggest that beekeeping in the Luneburg Heath can affect the conservation of stem-nesting bee species richness but not the overall reproduction either of stem-nesting or of ground-nesting bees.

Yeasts were isolated frequently from nectar, pollen, and provisions but rarely from guts or frass. The most prevalent yeast taxa were: Candida bombicola, Cryptococcus albidus, Metschnikowia reukaufii, and Rhodotorula glutinis. Although few filamentous fungi were found in nectar, they were frequently isolated from pollen and provisions; the predominant taxa were Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, C. herbarum, Epicoccum nigrum, and Penicillium chrysogenum. Bacteria, including species of Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus, and the actinomycete Streptomyces, also were prevalent in provisions and/or on pollen. In general, the diversity of microorganisms isolated from alimentary canals and frass was lower than from nectar, pollen, and provisions. Bacillus firmus, B. licheniformis, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and Streptomyces spp. were the most frequently isolated bacteria, whereas Trichosporonoides megachiliensis was the most common filamentous fungus isolated from larval guts and/or frass. These taxa may be part of the resident microflora of the alimentary canal. Populations of bacteria and filamentous fungi, but not yeasts, were larger from Ascosphaera aggregata-infected larvae than from healthy larvae. However, with the exception of Aspergillus niger and T. megachiliensis in frass from healthy larvae, no taxon of filamentous fungi was conspicuously present or absent in infected larvae, healthy larvae, or their frass.","1993","2022-11-02 15:22:14","2022-11-02T15:22:14Z",NA,"125–143","","2",26,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although invasive species are major topics of research, little consideration has been given to the implications of introducing non-native subspecies or beneficial organisms such as pollinators. However, the extensive trade in bumble bees as pollinators of glass-house crops involves both. Within regions in Europe, the importation of non-native commercially reared subspecies of Bombus terrestris could endanger native bumble bees through competitive displacement and/or hybridization. 2. This study made a direct ecological comparison between commercially imported and native B. terrestris colonies growing in the wild in the UK. In particular, using a paired design, we compared the nectar-foraging performance and reproductive outputs of commercial and native colonies growing under identical field conditions. 3. Commercial colonies performed well in the field, with substantially higher nectar-foraging rates than native colonies in four out of five locations. Nectar-foraging performance was positively correlated with forager size, with commercial bees being consistently larger than native bees. 4. All seven commercial colonies studied produced gynes (new queens), with two colonies each producing in excess of 50. In contrast, only two out of seven native colonies produced gynes, and those only produced small numbers (five in total). Males were produced by all colonies but there were no significant differences in numbers between commercial and native subspecies. 5. Synthesis and applications. The high reproductive success of commercial colonies indicates that there is an appreciable risk that they will become established and spread within the UK. Furthermore, their superior foraging ability and large colony size could lead them to out-compete native bumble bees. Clearly the invasive potential of non-native subspecies and/or beneficial organisms should not be overlooked. With respect to the current importation of commercial bumble bees, we strongly recommend a precautionary approach: native species and subspecies should be locally reared and the use/disposal of bees should be strictly regulated.","2006","2022-11-02 15:22:13","2022-11-02T15:22:13Z",NA,"940–948","","5",43,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bombus terrestris audax; Bombus terrestris dalmatinus; Bumble bee trade; Colony growth; Foraging performance; Reproductive success; Species introductions; Subspecies","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The numerical response by the honey bee population to the drastic increase of flower resources during general flowering was investigated for 6 yr by monthly light-trapping and by nest counts in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Borneo. The numbers of A. dorsata workers obtained by light-trapping were highest during general flowering periods, whereas very few workers were trapped in other periods. The abundance of A. dorsata nests showed temporal correspondence with the abundance of trapped workers, and the nests disappeared in the nonflowering periods. These data suggest that the A. dorsata population increases rapidly in response to general flowering and that this is initiated by nonseasonal, long-distance migration. Drones of A. dorsata were present during the general flowering period, but there is no evidence that reproduction by A. dorsata occurs only in general flowering periods. Fluctuation in abundance by the honey bee A. koschevnikovi Enderlein was also observed by monthly light-trapping. The temporal trend of this species was similar to that of A. dorsata, but sightings persisted even in the nonflowering periods.

Recent changes in the timing of environmental events attributable to climate change, such as the date of snowmelt at high altitudes, which initiates the growing season, have had important repercussions for some common perennial herbaceous wildflower species. The phenology of flowering at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Colorado, USA) is strongly influenced by date of snowmelt, which makes this site ideal for examining phenological responses to climate change. Flower buds of Delphinium barbeyi, Erigeron speciosus, and Helianthella quinquenervis are sensitive to frost, and the earlier beginning of the growing season in recent years has exposed them to more frequent mid-June frost kills. From 1992 to 1998, on average 36.1% of Helianthella buds were frosted, but for 1999-2006 the mean is 73.9%; in only one year since 1998 have plants escaped all frost damage. For all three of these perennial species, there is a significant relationship between the date of snowmelt and the abundance of flowering that summer. Greater snowpack results in later snowmelt, later beginning of the growing season, and less frost mortality of buds. Microhabitat differences in snow accumulation, snowmelt patterns, and cold air drainage during frost events can be significant; an elevation difference of only 12 m between two plots resulted in a temperature difference of almost 2 degrees C in 2006 and a difference of 37% in frost damage to buds. The loss of flowers and therefore seeds can reduce recruitment in these plant populations, and affect pollinators, herbivores, and seed predators that previously relied on them. Other plant species in this environment are similarly susceptible to frost damage so the negative effects for recruitment and for consumers dependent on flowers and seeds could be widespread. These findings point out the paradox of increased frost damage in the face of global warming, provide important insights into the adaptive significance of phenology, and have general implications for flowering plants throughout the region and anywhere climate change is having similar impacts.","2008","2022-11-02 15:22:09","2022-11-02T15:22:09Z",NA,"353–62","","2",89,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18409425",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To fill this gap in pollinator decline censuses and to provide a broad picture of the current status of honeybees across their natural range, we used microsatellite genetic markers to estimate colony densities and genetic diversity at different locations in Europe, Africa, and central Asia that had different patterns of land use. Genetic diversity and colony densities were highest in South Africa and lowest in Northern Europe and were correlated with mean annual temperature. Confounding factors not related to climate, however, are also likely to influence genetic diversity and colony densities in honeybee populations. Land use showed a significantly negative influence over genetic diversity and the density of honeybee colonies over all sampling locations. In Europe honeybees sampled in nature reserves had genetic diversity and colony densities similar to those sampled in agricultural landscapes, which suggests that the former are not wild but may have come from managed hives. Other results also support this idea: putative wild bees were rare in our European samples, and the mean estimated density of honeybee colonies on the continent closely resembled the reported mean number of managed hives. Current densities of European honeybee populations are in the same range as those found in the adverse climatic conditions of the Kalahari and Saharan deserts, which suggests that beekeeping activities do not compensate for the loss of wild colonies. Our findings highlight the importance of reconsidering the conservation status of honeybees in Europe and of regarding beekeeping not only as a profitable business for producing honey, but also as an essential component of biodiversity conservation.","2009","2022-11-02 15:22:06","2022-11-02T15:22:06Z",NA,"583–593","","2",24,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Abstract -Many temperate deciduous forests are recovering from past logging, but the effects of logging legacies and environmental gradients on forest insect pollinators have not been well studied. In this study, we asked how pollinator abundance and community composition varied with distance from logging roads and elevation in old (logged \textgreater90 years ago) and young (logged 20–40 years ago) southern Appalachian forests. Insect pollinators were sampled at 15 previously logged sites along an elevation gradient at 5 distances from logging roads during summer 2010 and spring 2011 using pan traps. In summer, many pol-linator groups were more abundant in younger forests and closer to logging roads, likely due LQSDUWWRPRUHOLJKWDYDLODELOLW$\backslash$DQGDJUHDWHUDEXQGDQFHRIÀRUDOUHVRXUFHVQHDUURDGV7RWDO bee abundance was greater near logging roads, but only in younger forests, suggesting that the role of roads in providing nectar and other resources may diminish as forests mature. In spring, many pollinator families were less abundant at mid-distances (2–10 m) from roads compared to road edges (0 m), but abundances were generally the same at 100 m from the road as at road edges. Two important bee families, Apidae and Andrenidae, were strongly associated with high elevations in spring. Our results suggest that logging legacies may provide supplemental resources such as food and nesting sites to insect pollinators during the summer months especially, with the effects of roads often extending at least 100 m into young forests.","2014","2022-11-02 15:22:05","2022-11-02T15:22:05Z",NA,"317–336","","2",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A study of gene flow has been carried out in an orchard composed of single rows of a ""pollinating"" cultivar between every double row of the most commercially desirable cultivar, Nonpareil. This ""two-to-one"" planting pattern was repeated throughout the orchard, and several ""pollinating"" cultivars were used in various parts of the orchard in an attempt to provide flowers for cross-pollination with Nonpareil at all stages of flowering of the latter. Using isozyme markers GPI-2, LAP-1, AAT-1, PGM-1, and PGM-2 and three newly-defined isozyme markers for almond - IDH, G6PD, and SDH - it has been shown that the gene flow resulting in nut set is quite restricted, taking place most strongly between neighboring halves of cross-compatibile pairs of trees. Even that half of a tree facing away from the ""pollinating"" tree has significantly less gene flow to it, while the next tree further on has few nuts set by fertilization from the ""pollinating"" tree under consideration. This result is surprising considering the comparatively large distances that the honeybee brought into the orchard in large numbers must travel within the orchard. To explain this apparent paradox and the observation that in most cases only a small proportion (\textless20%) of flowers set nuts, it is suggested that the honeybee predominantly visits only one cultivar, flying along the row of the cultivar to do so, and that cross-pollination results from accidental or rare visits involving two or more compatible cultivars.","1991","2022-11-02 15:22:05","2022-11-02T15:22:05Z",NA,"169–173","","2",82,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Almond orchard; Gene flow; Honeybee; Pollen","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Compelling theoretical knowledge about essential connections between ecosystem service generation, biodiversity, and resilience in social-ecological systems already exists; however, we still, to a great extent, lack spatially explicit quantitative assessments for translating this theoretical knowledge into practice. We propose an approach for measuring the change in flow and resilience of a regulating ecosystem service on a landscape scale over time when the landscape is exposed to both land use change due to urban expansion, and change in a large-scale economic driver. Our results quantitatively show that there can be a substantial decrease in resilience due to negative effects on response diversity without detecting any major decrease in ecosystem service generation over time, thus generating a sense of false security and sustainability.","2010","2022-11-02 15:22:02","2022-11-02T15:22:02Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.5751/ES-03520-150320",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Ecosystem services; Food security; Functional diversity; Pollination; Resilience; Response diversity; Urban ecology","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities. Overall, this study reveals that natural and human-altered landscapes can be managed for increased native bee nesting and extended foraging, dually enhancing biodiversity and the spatial extent of pollination services.","2013","2022-11-02 15:22:01","2022-11-02T15:22:01Z",NA,"555–558","","2",110,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The small size and short life of these pollinators is expected to make them more vulnerable to climate change than their larger and longer-lived hosts. We experimentally tested the thermal tolerances of four species of adult female fig wasp from equatorial Singapore. The results suggest that an increase of 38C or more above the current temperatures experienced across much of the equatorial tropics would markedly decrease the active adult lifespan of all four species.

The conservation of native bee communities within agroforestry landscapes is particularly urgent given the importance of pollination services within these systems. In this study, we examined tropical bee communities within a largely deforested shade coffee-growing region in Chiapas, Mexico. We used regression tree modeling to examine the response of bee functional groups to local and landscape-level habitat management. Our models revealed that the most predictive factors for bee abundance and species richness were the number of tree species, the number of tree species in flower, and the canopy cover of the local agroforestry landscape. Solitary bees were most abundant in habitats with high canopy cover, while social bees were most abundant in habitats with greater tree species richness. Cavity-nesting and wood-nesting bee abundance was positively affected by the amount of canopy cover in the farm, while ground-nesting bees were most abundant in habitats with a large number of tree species in flower. Our results demonstrate that across bee sociality groups, nesting guilds, and tribes, the most critical factor impacting native bee communities was within-farm local vegetation management. These results reveal the important role that agroforestry managers can have on biodiversity conservation, and the potential contribution they can make by creating resource-rich agricultural matrices. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of diverse overstory tree management in supporting native bee communities within tropical agroforestry systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","2010","2022-11-02 15:21:58","2022-11-02T15:21:58Z",NA,"1423–1431","","6",143,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Agroforestry; Bee; Coffee; Habitat management; Landscape; Nesting; Regression tree; Solitary bees","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bumble bees are one of the most effective native pollinators and are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats, yet little is known about how bumble bees move across fine spatial scales and what landscapes promote or limit their gene flow. In this study, we examine regional genetic differentiation and fine-scale relatedness patterns of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, to investigate how current and historic habitat composition impact gene flow. We conducted our study across a landscape mosaic of natural, agricultural and urban/suburban habitats, and we show that B. vosnesenskii exhibits low but significant levels of differentiation across the study system (FST= 0.019, Dest= 0.049). Most importantly, we reveal significant relationships between pairwise FSTand resistance models created from contemporary land use maps. Specifically, B. vosnesenskii gene flow is most limited by commercial, industrial and transportation-related impervious cover. Finally, our fine-scale analysis reveals significant but declining relatedness between individuals at the 1-9 km spatial scale, most likely due to local queen dispersal. Overall, our results indicate that B. vosnesenskii exhibits considerable local dispersal and that regional gene flow is significantly limited by impervious cover associated with urbanization. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2013","2022-11-02 15:21:57","2022-11-02T15:21:57Z","","2483–2495",NA,"9",22,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bombus; dispersal; landscape genetics; microsatellites; pollinator; urban ecology","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The problems remained restricted and localiz.ed until the surge in modern agricultural methods following World War II. Highly effective synthetic organic insecticides became feasible for use not only on all types of crops but also on tremendous acreages of rangelands and forests. Development of efficient herbicides led to severe reduction in bee forage plants on both cultivated and wild lands. This not only involves direct removal, such as elimination of sweetclover from wheat fields, but also treatments which cause displacement of bee plants by herbicide-tolerant, non-bee plants, such as dalmatian toad flax, yarrow, and nightshade. There can also be a conflict noxious weeds–e. g. yellow starthistle, Russian knapweed, hounds-tongue, and Canada thistle-are excellent pollen and nectar sources. Ever-increasing monocul­ tures of crops and the associated removal of fencerows and wild strips have reduced both bee forage and nest sites for wild bees. These developments have caused greater dependency upon honey bees for pollination of crops and simultaneously forced beekeepers to pasture their bees on insecticide-treated fields. Increasing the acreages of crops has a definite effect on pollination re quirements. Wild bees and hobbyist colonies of honey bees normally provide for good yields on 10 acres of raspberries, but a grower with SO acres usually re quires pollination service from a beekeeper. Development of hybrid varieties often increases the need for pollination. Hybrid onion and hybrid cabbage seed production pose special problems in transferring pollen from male-fertile rows to male-sterile rows or from compatible pollen rows to self-incompatible rows. Intensive plantings of dwarf fruit trees normally re quire two colonies of honey bees per acre, compared to one per acre in standard orchards. Many trends in modern agriculture have led to a vicious circle of increasing pollination re quirements and increasing dependency of beekeepers on insecticide-contaminated bee pasturage. Bee poisoning has become the number one problem for beekeepers on a worldwide scale.","2003","2022-11-02 15:21:54","2022-11-02T15:21:54Z","","177–192",NA,"1",22,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although some pyrethroids, such as cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, are highly toxic to honey bees, the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate is low enough to warrant its use to control parasitic mites inside honey bee colonies. Metabolic insecticide resistance in other insects is mediated by three major groups of detoxifying enzymes: the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), the carboxylesterases (COEs), and the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). To test the role of metabolic detoxification in mediating the relatively low toxicity of tau-fluvalinate compared with more toxic pyrethroid insecticides, we examined the effects of piperonyl butoxide (PBO), S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), and diethyl maleate (DEM) on the toxicity of these pyrethroids. The toxicity of the three pyrethroids to bees was greatly synergized by the P450 inhibitor PBO and synergized at low levels by the carboxylesterase inhibitor DEF. Little synergism was observed with DEM. These results suggest that metabolic detoxification, especially that mediated by P450s, contributes significantly to honey bee tolerance of pyrethroid insecticides. The potent synergism between tau-fluvalinate and PBO suggests that P450s are especially important in the detoxification of this pyrethroid and explains the ability of honey bees to tolerate its presence.","2006","2022-11-02 15:21:50","2022-11-02T15:21:50Z","","1046–1050",NA,"4",99,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Apistan; Carboxylesterase; Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase; Glutathione S-transferase; Varroa destructor","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Colony success also depends on management of the ectoparasitic bee mite, Varroa destructor, which has historically been achieved using miticides that may also impact honey bee health. Previous work has demonstrated that the exposure of drone honey bees to miticidal Checkmite+™ strips (coumaphos) can result in decreased sperm viability. In this study we applied a range of sublethal doses of six miticides (tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos, fenpyroximate, amitraz, thymol and oxalic acid) to 1-4 day old adult drones. We returned drones to their home colony and re-collected them two to three weeks later to assess sperm viability using SYBR14 and propidium iodide stains. Counts of live and dead sperm were automated using the EBImage library in the R statistical environment. Sperm viability was not affected by any of the six miticide treatments, which suggests that acute miticide exposure in adult drones has little effect on drones' reproductive potential. However, two of the six miticides tested had an effect on drone recapture rate: fenpyroximate reduced and thymol increased the likelihood of drone recapture. These results suggest that future research on the effect of pesticides to drone sperm viability should focus on exposure in the immature stages and that beekeepers concerned with drone reproductive health may be able to safely apply miticides when only adult drones are present.

Here, we analyze the establishment phase of invasion with eco-evolutionary models of introduced species involved in predator-prey, mutualistic, or competitive interactions with a resident species. We find that, depending on the strength of the biotic interaction, establishment is impossible, guaranteed, or, in a narrow range, determined by genetic variation. Over this narrow range, rapid evolution of the introduced species always favors establishment, whereas resident evolution may either inhibit or facilitate establishment, depending on the interaction type. Coevolution can also either increase or decrease the chance of establishment, depending on the initial genotype frequencies as well as the interaction type. Our results suggest that the conditions under which genetic variation influences establishment success are limited, but they highlight the importance of considering the resident community's evolutionary response to introduced species as a component of its invasibility.","2012","2022-11-02 15:21:47","2022-11-02T15:21:47Z","","E28–E36",NA,"2",179,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) has great potential to be served by wild pollinators because of a reliable and widespread group of bee species that are commonly associated with their flowers, including bumble bees (Bomhus spp. ), and, in the Americas, two genera of specialist ground nesting bees (Peponapis and Xenoglossa). We examined the effects of several key farm management practices and landscape variables on bee abundance in pumpkin on 20 farms in Virginia and Maryland during summer 2006. We evaluated bee abundance with respect to tillage, irrigation practices, soil properties, natural habitat (forest and grassland), flowering crop, and disturbed areas. Additionally, we examined nest site preference (within or outside of crop areas) of Peponapis pruinosa (Say) at one farm and in a large screenhouse. We found P. pruinosa nesting preferentially within crop areas and near the vines and leaves of their host plant. Although these bees typically place some of their brood cells within tillage depth, we did not find a tillage effect on their abundance at flowers. We found a negative effect of soil clay content (R 2 = 0.24, P = 0.03) and a positive effect of irrigation (F 1 15= 12.2; P \textless 0.001) on P. pruinosa abundance. Using published data on pollinator visitation requirements, we found wild bee densities were sufficient to fully pollinate all pumpkin flowers on 13-17 of the 20 farms studied. ¬© 2009 Entomological Society of America.","2009","2022-11-02 15:21:45","2022-11-02T15:21:45Z","","563–573",NA,"2",102,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recently, nearly 30% of queens of the Japanese native species Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis and B. hypocrita hypocrita were estimated to copulate with B. terrestris males in the field, suggesting that indigenous bumblebees could be genetically deteriorated through hybrid production with the introduced species. In this study, we evaluated hybrid production between the introduced B. terrestris and the indigenous B. hypocrita sapporoensis under laboratory conditions. The hatching rate of eggs derived from interspecific matings was 0% and 8.6% depending on the direction of the cross, which was significantly lower than that from intraspecific matings of B. terrestris (76.9%) and B. hypocrita sapporoensis (78.9%). Genetic studies using microsatellite markers revealed that both haploid and diploid individuals were present in the egg stage, whereas all hatched larvae were haploid. In addition, histological studies revealed that eggs derived from interspecific matings terminated development 2 days after oviposition. These results strongly suggested that eggs derived from interspecific matings are inviable due to post-mating isolation mechanisms.

However, such habitats are also under socio-economic pressures due to redevelopment for housing and industrial uses. In order to maintain urban biodiversity, it is currently unknown how much open area must be preserved and whether conservation is possible without complete exclusion from economic development. In this study, we applied a simulation model based on species distribution models for plants, grasshoppers, and leafhoppers to investigate planning options for urban conservation with special focus on business areas. Altogether, we modelled the occurrence of 81 species of the urban species pool and analysed settings of different proportions of open sites, different habitat turnover times, and different lot sizes. Our simulations demonstrated that dynamic land use supports urban biodiversity in terms of species richness and rarity. Setting aside brownfields before redevelopment for a period of on average 15. years supported the highest conservation value. Consequently, we recommend integrating the concept of 'temporary conservation' into urban planning for industrial and business areas. This concept requires habitat to be destroyed by redeveloping brownfield sites to built-up sites, but simultaneously creating new open spaces due to abandonment of urban land uses at other locations. This maintains a spatio-temporal mosaic of different successional stages ranging from pioneer to pre-forest communities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2011","2022-11-02 15:21:40","2022-11-02T15:21:40Z","","2335–2343",NA,"9",144,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Brownfields; Dynamic landscape; Species distribution model; Species richness; Temporary buildings; Wasteland","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To investigate community-level pollination mutualism in this endemic ecosystem, we observed flower visitors on 99 plant species in 42 families of various types of vegetation. Among the 95 native plant species, the most dominant pollination system was melittophily (bee-pollinated, 46.3%), followed by phalaenophily (moth-pollinated, 20.0%), ornithophily (bird-pollinated, 11.6%), cantharophily (beetle-pollinated, 8.4%), myophily (fly-pollinated, 3.2%), chiropterophily (bat-pollinated, 3.2%), and anemophily (wind-pollinated, 3.2%). The prevalence of ornithophily by honeyeaters shows an ecological link to pollination mutualism in Australia. The relative dominance of phalaenophily is unique to New Caledonia, and is proposed to be related to the low diversity of the original bee fauna and the absence of long-tongued bees. Although some archaic plants maintain archaic plant-pollinator interactions, e.g., Zygogynum pollinated by micropterigid moths, or Hedycarya pollinated by thrips and staphylinid beetles, the most dominant organism observed on flowers was the introduced honey bee, Apis mellifera. The plant species now visited by honey bees are thought to have originally been pollinated by native solitary short-tongued bees. Our data suggest that the unique systems of pollination mutualism in New Caledonia are now endangered by the establishment of highly invasive honey bees.","2004","2022-11-02 15:21:39","2022-11-02T15:21:39Z","","1814–1827",NA,"11",91,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Bird pollination; Honey bee invasion; New Caledonia; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollination","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being appreciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricultural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other pollinators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The ""pollination crisis"" that is evident in declines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must redouble efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural and agricultural ecosystems.","1998-11","2022-11-02 15:21:38","2022-11-02T15:21:38Z","","83–112",NA,"1",29,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"PMID: 10196",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; agriculture; ecosystem services; fragmentation; habitat alteration; species","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The reliability of predictions of SDMs has been questioned because models often lack a mechanistic underpinning and rely on assumptions that are untenable under climate change. We show how integrating predictions from fundamentally different modeling strategies produces robust forecasts of climate change impacts on habitat and population parameters. We illustrate the principle by applying mechanistic (Niche Mapper) and correlative (Maxent, Bioclim) SDMs to predict current and future distributions and fertility of an Australian gliding possum. The two approaches make congruent, accurate predictions of current distribution and similar, dire predictions about the impact of a warming scenario, supporting previous correlative-only predictions for similar species.

Most information about such associations is available for colony-building organisms, and especially the honey bee. There, active manipulations through worker bees result in a restricted diversity of microbes present within the colony environment. Microbial diversity in solitary bee nests remains unstudied, although their larvae face a very different situation compared with social bees by growing up in isolated compartments. Here, we assessed the microbiota present in nests and pre-adults of Osmia bicornis, the red mason bee, by culture-independent pyrosequencing. We found high bacterial diversity not comparable with honey bee colonies. We identified a variety of bacteria potentially with positive or negative interactions for bee larvae. However, most of the other diverse bacteria present in the nests seem to originate from environmental sources through incorporated nest building material and stored pollen. This diversity of microorganisms may cause severe larval mortality and require specific physiological or symbiotic adaptations against microbial threats. They may however also profit from such a diverse environment through gain of mutualistic partners. We conclude that further studies of microbiota interaction in solitary bees will improve the understanding of fitness components and populations dynamics. © 2013 Keller et al.","2013","2022-11-02 15:21:35","2022-11-02T15:21:35Z","","",NA,"10",8,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evaluation of the ecological risk of alien pollinators is necessary because they could have a large impact on native ecosystems through disturbing native plant-pollinator interactions. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine the impact of the non-native commercialized European bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, on the pollination success of seven Japanese bumblebee-pollinated plant species. Plants were exposed to three groups of bumblebees: native bumblebee(s) only (NATIVE treatment); the alien bee only (ALIEN) and a mix of the two (MIX). ALIEN treatment had negative effects on fruitset and/or fruit quality of five plants, including self-incompatible and compatible, herb and woody, and queen- and worker-pollinated species. The negative effects were caused by a decrease in legitimate flower visitation due to (1) physical inaccessibility to nectary in deep-corolla flowers by the alien bee with insufficient tongue length and, (2) biased flower preference between short-corolla flowers. Fruitset tended to decrease drastically for the self-incompatible species while fruit quality decreased moderately for the self-compatible species. Effects of MIX were not intermediate between NATIVE and ALIEN in most plant species, and caused pollination success to vary in an unpredictable manner amongst plant species, probably due to interaction between native and alien bees.

Since Apis mellifera lose their stings as a result of use of the sting in defense, the authors suggest that new methods of defense evolved which do not exact a heavy toll of the colony. The fact that there are at least thirteen ways in which stingless bees protect themselves, makes stings obsolete. In 24 species of Apinae it has been possible to correlate different levels of evolution with: nests, communication systems, mandibular glands and cytology.

Using a wild tomato, Solanum peruvianum, native to the Peruvian Andes, we evaluated the disruption of pollination as a potential ecological cost of induced responses. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic changes in herbivore-attacked plants, such as the herbivore-induced emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), alter pollinator behavior and consequentially affect plant fitness. We conducted a series of manipulative field experiments to evaluate the role of herbivore-induced vegetative and floral VOC emissions as mechanisms by which herbivory affects pollinator behavior. In field surveys and bioassays in the plants' native habitat, we found that real and simulated herbivory (methyl jasmonate application) reduced attractiveness of S. peruvianum flowers to their native pollinators. We show that reduced pollinator preference, not resource limitation due to leaf tissue removal, resulted in reduced seed set. Solitary bee pollinators use floral plant volatiles, emitted in response to herbivory or methyl jasmonate treatment, as cues to avoid inflorescences on damaged plants. This herbivory-induced pollinator limitation can be viewed as a general cost of induced plant responses as well as a specific cost of herbivory-induced volatile emission.","2011","2022-11-02 15:21:31","2022-11-02T15:21:31Z","","1769–1780",NA,"9",92,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource; Cajacay province; Constancy; Cost of defenses; Herbivory; Indirect defenses; Induced resistance; Peru; Peruvian Andes; Pollination; Pollinator limitation; Solanaceae; Wild tomato (Solanum peruvianum)","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The economic value of such insects to pollination, seed set, and fruit formation greatly outweighs that suggested by more conventional indices, such as the value of honey and wax produced by honeybees. Although the European honeybee has been widely regarded as the single most important pollinating species, the increasing spread of trachael and Varroa mites and Africanized bees threatens the distribution and magnitude of traditional honeybeekeeping enterprises in North America. A number of other bee and insect pollinators, such as orchard bees, bumblebees, and squash bees, which are not affected by either the mites or the Africanized bees, are considered as likely candidates for management and use in commercial agriculture. An additional role can be played by native or wild pollinators, provided that attention is given to curtailing of population losses caused by both inadvertent insecticide poisoning and habitat destruction. To ensure a reliable source of pollinators, both managed and native, a more comprehensive strategy for management of crop pollination is needed. Elements of this strategy include an increased understanding of the biology and ecology of pollinating insects, as well as providing appropriate nesting habitat, and ensuring the availability of alternative sources of “forage” to sustain populations when the target crops are not in bloom. Examples are discussed to illustrate how private initiatives and changes to public policy can enhance pollinator habitat, and ultimately, agricultural productivity.","1990","2022-11-02 15:21:31","2022-11-02T15:21:31Z","","13–22",NA,"1",5,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"#nosource","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Agricultural land serves multiple societal purposes; it provides food, fuel and fibre and also acts as habitat for organisms and supports the services they provide. Biodiversity conservation and food production need to be balanced: production needs to be sustainable, while conservation cannot be totally at the expense of crop yield. To identify the benefits (in terms of biodiversity conservation) and costs (in terms of reduction in yields) of agricultural management, we examined the relationship between crop yield and abundance and species density of important taxa in winter cereal fields on both organic and conventional farms in lowland England. Of eight species groups examined, five (farmland plants, bumblebees, butterflies, solitary bees and epigeal arthropods) were negatively associated with crop yield, but the shape of this relationship varied between taxa. It was linear for the abundance of bumblebees and species density of butterflies, concave up for the abundance of epigeal arthropods and butterflies and concave down for species density of plants and bumblebees. Grain production per unit area was 54% lower in organic compared with conventional fields. When controlling for yield, diversity of bumblebees, butterflies, hoverflies and epigeal arthropods did not differ between farming systems, indicating that observed differences in biodiversity between organic and conventional fields are explained by lower yields in organic fields and not by different management practices per se. Only percentage cover and species density of plants were increased by organic field management after controlling for yield. The abundance of solitary wild bees and hoverflies was increased in landscapes with high amount of organic land. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that considerable gains in biodiversity require roughly proportionate reductions in yield in highly productive agricultural systems. They suggest that conservation efforts may be more cost effective in low-productivity agricultural systems or on non-agricultural land. In less productive agricultural landscapes, biodiversity benefit can be gained by concentrating organic farms into hotspots without a commensurate reduction in yield.","2013-04","2022-10-04 12:03:06","2022-10-04T12:03:06Z","","355–364",NA,"2",50,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"PMID: 86177920",NA,NA,NA,"Agri-environment schemes; Agro-ecology; Conservation; Diversity; Land sharing; Land sparing; Landscape; Organic farming; Wheat; Yield","/unread","Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We quantified the yearly change in community composition in response to climate change for 9,490 bird and 2,130 butterfly communities distributed across Europe.

Human alteration of the terrestrial biosphere has been significant for more than 8000 years. However, only in the past century has the majority of the terrestrial biosphere been transformed into intensively used anthromes with predominantly novel anthropogenic ecological processes. At present, even were human populations to decline substantially or use of land become far more efficient, the current global extent, duration, type and intensity of human transformation of ecosystems have already irreversibly altered the terrestrial biosphere at levels sufficient to leave an unambiguous geological record differing substantially from that of the Holocene or any prior epoch.

Anthropogenic transformation of terrestrial biomes was then characterized by map comparisons at century intervals.ResultsIn 1700, nearly half of the terrestrial biosphere was wild, without human settlements or substantial land use. Most of the remainder was in a seminatural state (45%) having only minor use for agriculture and settlements. By 2000, the opposite was true, with the majority of the biosphere in agricultural and settled anthromes, less than 20% seminatural and only a quarter left wild. Anthropogenic transformation of the biosphere during the Industrial Revolution resulted about equally from land-use expansion into wildlands and intensification of land use within seminatural anthromes. Transformation pathways differed strongly between biomes and regions, with some remaining mostly wild but with the majority almost completely transformed into rangelands, croplands and villages. In the process of transforming almost 39% of earth's total ice-free surface into agricultural land and settlements, an additional 37% of global land without such use has become embedded within agricultural and settled anthromes.Main conclusionsBetween 1700 and 2000, the terrestrial biosphere made the critical transition from mostly wild to mostly anthropogenic, passing the 50% mark early in the 20th century. At present, and ever more in the future, the form and process of terrestrial ecosystems in most biomes will be predominantly anthropogenic, the product of land use and other direct human interactions with ecosystems. Ecological research and conservation efforts in all but a few biomes would benefit from a primary focus on the novel remnant, recovering and managed ecosystems embedded within used lands.","2010","2022-10-04 12:02:49","2022-10-04T12:02:49Z","","589–606",NA,"5",19,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture; Anthromes; Anthropogenic landscapes; Conservation; Environmental history; Global change; Land-use change; Novel ecosystems; Terrestrial ecosystems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Individual species may decline as a result of interacting exogenous and endogenous threats, including habitat loss, habitat degradation, habitat isolation, changes in the biology, behaviour, and interactions of species, as well as additional, stochastic threats. Human-perceived landscape patterns that are frequently correlated with species assemblages include the amount and structure of native vegetation, the prevalence of anthropogenic edges, the degree of landscape connectivity, and the structure and heterogeneity of modified areas.

After outlining the different uses and limitations of these methods, we make eight primary suggestions for improving forecasts. We find that greater use of the fossil record and of modern genetic studies would improve forecasting methods. We note a Quaternary conundrum: While current empirical and theoretical ecological results suggest that many species could be at risk from global warming, during the recent ice ages surprisingly few species became extinct. The potential resolution of this conundrum gives insights into the requirements for more accurate and reliable forecasting.

We compared four 20-year periods, comparing periods of rapid land-use intensification and natural habitat loss (1930-1990) with a period of increased conservation investment (post-1990). We found that extensive species richness loss and biotic homogenisation occurred before 1990, whereas these negative trends became substantially less accentuated during recent decades, being partially reversed for certain taxa (e.g. bees in Great Britain and Netherlands).

Effective conservation strategies depend on the type of relationship between biodiversity and land-use intensity, but to date the shape of this relationship is unknown. We linked plant species richness with nitrogen (N) input as an indicator of land-use intensity on 130 grasslands and 141 arable fields in six European countries. Using Poisson regression, we found that plant species richness was significantly negatively related to N input on both field types after the effects of confounding environmental factors had been accounted for. Subsequent analyses showed that exponentially declining relationships provided a better fit than linear or unimodal relationships and that this was largely the result of the response of rare species (relative cover less than 1%). Our results indicate that conservation benefits are disproportionally more costly on high-intensity than on low-intensity farmland. For example, reducing N inputs from 75 to 0 and 400 to 60kgha-1yr-1 resulted in about the same estimated species gain for arable plants. Conservation initiatives are most (cost-)effective if they are preferentially implemented in extensively farmed areas that still support high levels of biodiversity.","2012-03","2022-10-04 12:02:11","2022-10-04T12:02:11Z","","903–909",NA,"1658",276,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"PMID: 19019785",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture; Conservation ecology; Farmland wildlife; Fertilizer; Plant species richness; Policy implications","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These studies indicate that urbanization can increase or decrease species richness, depending on several variables. Some of these variables include: taxonomic group, spatial scale of analysis, and intensity of urbanization. Recent reviews of birds (the most-studied group) indicate that species richness decreases with increasing urbanization in most cases but produces no change or even increases richness in some studies. Here I expand beyond the bird studies by reviewing 105 studies on the effects of urbanization on the species richness of non-avian species: mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates and plants. For all groups, species richness tends to be reduced in areas with extreme urbanization (i.e., central urban core areas). However, the effects of moderate levels of urbanization (i.e., suburban areas) vary significantly among groups. Most of the plant studies (about 65%) indicate increasing species richness with moderate urbanization whereas only a minority of invertebrate studies (about 30%) and a very small minority of non-avian vertebrate studies (about 12%) show increasing species richness. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, including the importance of nonnative species importation, spatial heterogeneity, intermediate disturbance and scale as major factors influencing species richness.","2008-06","2022-10-04 12:01:58","2022-10-04T12:01:58Z","","161–176",NA,"2",11,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"PMID: 20926156",NA,NA,NA,"Anthropogenic; Biodiversity; Species richness; Urban; Urbanization","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.","2009-12","2022-10-04 12:01:34","2022-10-04T12:01:34Z","","S178–S186",NA,"SUPPL. 1",26,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Land cover; Land management; Land use monitoring; Wildlife management","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Humans have traded and transported alien species for millennia with two notable step-changes: the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, in recent decades the world has entered a new phase in the magnitude and diversity of biological invasions: the Era of Globalization. This Special Profile reviews the links between the main drivers of globalization and biological invasions and examines state-of-the-art approaches to pathway risk assessment to illustrate new opportunities for managing invasive species.2. Income growth is a primary driver of globalization and a clear association exists between Gross Domestic Product and the richness of alien floras and faunas for many regions of the world. In many cases, the exposure of these economies to trade is highlighted by the significant role of merchandise imports in biological invasions, especially for island ecosystems.3. Post-1950, technical and logistic improvements have accelerated the ease with which commodities are transported across the globe and hindered the traceability of goods and the ease of intercepting pests. New sea, land and air links in international trade and human transport have established novel pathways for the spread of alien species. Increasingly, the science advances underpinning invasive species management must move at the speed of commerce.4. Increasing transport networks and demand for commodities have led to pathway risk assessments becoming the frontline in the prevention of biological invasions. The diverse routes of introduction arising from contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided pathways, in both aquatic and terrestrial biomes are complex. Nevertheless, common features enable comparable approaches to risk assessment. By bringing together spatial data on climate suitability, habitat availability and points of entry, as well a demographic models that include species dispersal (both natural and human-mediated) and measures of propagule pressure, it is possible to generate risk maps highlighting potential invasion hotspots that can inform prevention strategies.5. Synthesis and applications. To date, most attempts to model pathways have focused on describing the likelihood of invader establishment. Few have modelled explicit management strategies such as optimal detection and inspection strategies and assessments of the effectiveness of different management measures. A future focus in these areas will ensure research informs response.","2009","2022-10-04 12:01:27","2022-10-04T12:01:27Z","","10–18",NA,"1",46,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Alien; Exotic; Globalisation; Model; Pest; Propagule pressure; Weed","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
