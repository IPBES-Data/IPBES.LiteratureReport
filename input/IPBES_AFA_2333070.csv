E.","Climate change impacts on agro-ecosystem sustainability across three climate regions in the maize belt of South Africa","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","","01678809","10.1016/j.agee.2007.09.001","","The Highveld region in South Africa is an important area for its food production for the nation, as 70% of country's cereal crops and 90% of the commercially grown maize is cultivated there. The sustainability of these agro-ecosystems is, therefore, of vital importance for the nation's food security. The western part of the Highveld is characterised by relatively low mean annual precipitation (MAP) and highly variable yields, and while rainfall increases towards the east, inter-annual yield variability remains high. Variability of yields is already a concern for agro-ecosystems and it is hypothesised that it could be exacerbated by future climate changes. A sustainability framework was used to assess the sustainability agro-ecosystems under plausible future climate scenarios. Three Quaternary Catchments were assessed ranging from relatively dry (MAP 432 mm) to relatively moist (MAP 903 mm). A sensitivity analysis of plausible scenarios was performed with incremental increases in temperature by 1, 2 or 3 °C, increases/decreases of rainfall by 10% and a doubling of pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentrations to 555 ppmv. From the present and nine plausible future climate scenarios which were modelled using CERES-Maize over a 44-year period, it is shown that climatic changes could have major negative effects on the already drier western, and therefore more vulnerable, areas of the South African Highveld. An increase in temperature increases the variability of yields in the relatively moist Piet Retief area (MAP 903 mm), while at the more sub-humid Bothaville, with a MAP of only 552 mm, the inter-annual variability remains the same but mean yield over 44 seasons is reduced by 30%. A simulated increase in temperature coupled with a doubling of CO2 increases the rate of soil organic nitrogen depletion from the agro-ecosystem. Therefore, long-term perspectives in regard to human well-being and ecological integrity need to be applied to policies and actions for sustainability of both commercial and smallholder agro-ecosystems, particularly, in the western Highveld. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The interaction of multiple factors generates variable patterns of fire occurrence in space and time. Understanding the dominant fire drivers at different spatial scales is a fundamental goal to minimize the negative impacts of fires. Our aim was to identify the biophysical and human drivers of fires in the Semiarid Chaco mountains of Central Argentina and their individual effects on fire activity, in order to determine the thresholds and/or ranges of the drivers at which fire occurrence is favored or disfavored. We used fire frequency as the response variable and a set of 28 potential predictor variables, which included climatic, human, topographic, biological and hydrological factors. Data were analyzed using Boosted Regression Trees, using data from near 10,500 sampling points. Our model identified the fire drivers accurately (75.6% of deviance explained). Although humans are responsible for most ignitions, climatic variables, such as annual precipitation, annual potential evapotranspiration and temperature seasonality were the most important determiners of fire frequency, followed by human (population density and distance to waste disposals) and biological (NDVI) predictors. In general, fire activity was higher at intermediate levels of precipitation and primary productivity and in the proximity of urban solid waste disposals. Fires were also more prone to occur in areas with greater variability in temperature and productivity. Boosted Regression Trees proved to be a useful and accurate tool to determine fire controls and the ranges at which drivers favor fire activity. Our approach provides a valuable insight into the ecology of fires in our study area and in other landscapes with similar characteristics, and the results will be helpful to develop management policies and predict changes in fire activity in response to different climate changes and development scenarios.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:16:12","2019-06-28T18:16:12Z",NA,"1–12","","",520,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25782079",NA,NA,NA,"Boosted Regression Trees; Chaco Serrano; Fire drivers; Fire ecology; Fire frequency; Semiarid Chaco; Sierras de C??rdoba",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, little information is available on the on-site causes of DFD in these areas. This paper estimates the levels of DFD and identifies the drivers in the Ankasa Conservation Area (ACA) in Ghana as a case study. A survey was used to identify both direct and underlying factors that promote the DFD. The extent of deforestation was estimated using satellite images. The survey data were analyzed using rankings and ordinal logistic regression techniques, while digital image classification and change detection were used to analyze land cover changes. The results show that DFD occurred at a higher rate in the periphery of the ACA compared to the core-protected and the farthest areas. Agricultural and wood harvesting activities were the main direct causes of DFD. Poverty and large in-migrations of people for cocoa farming were important underlying economic and population growth factors. To address these problems and enable ACA to contribute more to biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, the community resource management institutions should be fully adopted and strengthened and priority given to livelihood improvement and ecosystem services provision in the periphery of the ACA. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:16:03","2019-06-28T18:16:03Z",NA,"86–94","","",165,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ankasa Conservation Area periphery; Control measures; Deforestation levels; Drivers",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Across flood plains of gravel-bottom rivers, spring brooks emerge from points of groundwater discharge that may occur in distinct landscape positions. We investigated how ecosystem processes in spring brooks differ spatially across biophysical zones, reflecting how landscape position dictates severity of flood disturbance, allochthonous loading from riparian forests, and inputs from groundwater systems. Between July and October 2011, we quantified aspects of ecosystem structure and function among 6 spring brooks of the Nyack flood plain, Flathead River, Montana. Structural features varied predictably across near-channel (i.e., parafluvial) and late successional (i.e., orthofluvial) biophysical zones. Large wood standing stocks increased \textgreater40x (0.19-9.19 kg/m(2)), dominant particle size class differed by an order of magnitude (median particle size [D-50] = 2-27), and measures of vertical hydraulic gradient (-0.06 to +0.12 cm/cm) reflected differences in landscape position. We found fine sediment accumulation, stronger groundwater inputs, and greater benthic and large wood standing stocks in orthofluvial than in parafluvial spring brooks. Algal biomass was negatively correlated with insolation and positively related to vertical hydraulic gradient. Results from microcosm experiments showed increasing N uptake across the gradient from parafluvial to orthofluvial spring brooks.

The increasingly common legal requirement to first avoid, then reduce and, if necessary, offset impacts of plans and projects on biodiversity has however not always been appropriately enforced. The blame lies mainly in bad governance such as patchy monitoring or poorly defined liabilities. Biodiversity offsets also suffer from the lack of formal methods for designing and sizing offset requirements. We address this gap by reviewing different tools, methods and guidelines that have been developed in different regulatory contexts. We then formulate a typology of approaches that variously combine these methods and guidelines. We discuss how these relate to the objectives of offset policies and the components of biodiversity and ecosystems to which they apply.

As early as 1992, Maxwell and Smith (1992) reviewed more than 180 items discussing concepts and definitions, and more definitions have been formulated since (DEFRA, 2006). Whereas many earlier definitions centered on food production, more recent definitions highlight access to food, in keeping with the 1996 World Food Summit definition (FAO, 1996) that food security is met when “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.” Worldwide attention on food access was given impetus by the food “price spike” in 2007–2008, triggered by a complex set of long- and short-term factors (FAO, 2009b; von Braun and Torero, 2009). FAO concluded, “provisional estimates show that, in 2007, 75 million more people were added to the total number of undernourished relative to 2003–05” (FAO, 2008); this is arguably a low-end estimate (Headey and Fan, 2010). More than enough food is currently produced per capita to feed the global population, yet about 870 million people remained hungry in the period from 2010 to 2012 (FAO et al., 2012). The questions for this chapter are how far climate and its change affect current food production systems and food security and the extent to which they will do so in the future (Figure 7-1).",2014,"2019-06-28 18:15:49","2019-06-28T18:15:49Z",NA,"485–533","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"adaptation; climate change impacts; vulnerability",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we provide theory and a global empirical evaluation to address this challenge. We show that extinction estimates based on endemics–area and backward species–area relationships are complementary, and the crucial difference comprises the geometry of area loss. Across three taxa on four continents, the relative loss of species, and of phylogenetic and functional diversity, is highest when habitable area disappears inward from the edge of a region, lower when it disappears from the centre outwards, and lowest when area is lost at random. In inward destruction, species loss is almost proportional to area loss, although the decline in phylogenetic and functional diversity is less severe. These trends are explained by the geometry of species ranges and the shape of phylogenetic and functional trees, which may allow baseline predictions of biodiversity decline for underexplored taxa.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:15:48","2019-06-28T18:15:48Z",NA,"1–11","","",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This transition toward decentralized management represents a changing governance landscape. This paper explores the transition to decentralisation in marine resource management systems in three East African countries. The paper draws upon expert opinion and literature from both political science and linked social-ecological systems fields to guide exploration of five key governance transition concepts in each country: (1) drivers of change; (2) institutional arrangements; (3) institutional fit; (4) actor interactions; and (5) adaptive management. Key findings are that decentralized management in the region was largely donor-driven and only partly transferred power to local stakeholders. However, increased accountability created a degree of democracy in regards to natural resource governance that was not previously present. Additionally, increased local-level adaptive management has emerged in most systems and, to date, this experimental management has helped to change resource user's views from metaphysical to more scientific cause-and-effect attribution of changes to resource conditions.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:15:43","2019-06-28T18:15:43Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, a global-scale understanding of fire is largely limited to the annual extent of burning as detected by satellites. This is problematic becausefire ismultidimensional, and focus ona single metric belies its complexity and importance within the Earth system. To address this,weidentifiedfive key characteristics offire regimes— size, frequency, intensity, season, and extent—and combined new and existing global datasets to represent each. We assessed how these global fire regime characteristics are related to patterns of climate, vegetation (biomes), and human activity. Cross-correla- tions demonstrate that only certain combinations of fire character- istics are possible, reflecting fundamental constraints in the types of fire regimes that can exist. A Bayesian clustering algorithm iden- tified five global syndromes of fire regimes, or pyromes. Four pyromes represent distinctions between crown, litter, and grass- fueled fires, and the relationship of these to biomes and climate are not deterministic. Pyromes were partially discriminated on the basis of available moisture and rainfall seasonality. Human impacts also affected pyromes and are globally apparent as the driver of afifth and unique pyrome that represents human-engineered mod- ifications to fire characteristics. Differing biomes and climates may be represented within the samepyrome, implying that pathways of change in future fire regimes in response to changes in climate and human activity may be difficult to predict.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:15:41","2019-06-28T18:15:41Z",NA,"6445–6447","","16",110,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23559374",NA,NA,NA,"Free-climate- vegetation feedback; energetic constraints; fire intensity; fire return period; fire size",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is true of both marine and terrestrial systems of southern Africa, a region of high biodiversity and including several large conservation areas. Global change drivers have had substantial effects across many levels of the biological hierarchy as is demonstrated in this review, which focuses on terrestrial systems. Interactions among drivers, such as between climate change and invasion, and between changing fire regimes and invasion, are complicating attribution of change effects and management thereof. Likewise CO(2) fertilization is having a much larger impact on terrestrial systems than perhaps commonly acknowledged.

In this lake, tissue stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes can be used over several trophic levels to distinguish those consumers relying upon carbon fixed by either benthic or pelagic primary producers. As such, it was possible to contrast the biomagnification of persistent organochlorines through the benthic and pelagic food webs. In 1996 and 1997, food- web organisms were collected from Lake Malawi and analyzed for organochlorines, δ13C and δ15N to determine the factors that affect the biomagnification of contaminants inatropical lake.ThepesticideDDTwasthe most predominant pollutant in the biota from Lake Malawi and was found at the highest concentrations in the largest and fattiest fish species. As observed in temperate systems, log- transformed ΣDDT concentrations in food-web organisms were significantly predicted by δ15N or log lipid ( r 2 ) 0.32 and 0.40, respectively). In addition, the slope of the regression of log ΣDDT versus δ15N was significantly higher in the pelagic than the benthic food web. These results indicate that pelagic organisms are at greater risk of accumulating these pollutants than biota relying upon benthic primary production.

This article discusses examples of legacy and emerging contaminants and their interactions with other drivers within the basin. A historical review of these contaminants from the past 50years (1963 to present) has been prepared, as well as a synthesis of their current state. From this information and based on local and global initiatives and reports, three future scenarios for contaminants have been described projecting to the next 50years (present to 2063), which are categorized as Status Quo, Utopian, and Dystopian. These are meant to categorize the possible range of occurrences and help decision makers prepare for various management options and improve resilience to future changes. In addition, we have highlighted some tools that are needed to effectively detect emerging contaminants in the basin.

This inherent scarcity lends itself to diffi culty and insecurity in conservation efforts (Weber & Rabinowitz, 1996), as small declines in already small populations can set into motion unpredictable and uncontrollable stochastic forces as part of the small-population paradigm (Caughley, 1994).",2009,"2019-06-28 18:15:15","2019-06-28T18:15:15Z",NA,"1–9","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1002/9781444312034.ch1",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation scientists; Determining success of reintroductions of top-orde; Identifying top-order predators-conservation manag; Panthera onca; Reintroduction-attempt to establish species within; Threatening processes affecting top-order predator; Top-order predators persecuted by humans-brown bea; Top-order predators-describing carnivorous mammali; Top-order predators-relatively rare in natural eco; Top-order predators-using science to restore drive; Uncia uncia; Ursus arctos; and describing natural history of threatened speci; deliberate movement of wild individuals between pa; in Europe; in Himalayas or jaguars; in Venezuela; snow leopards",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A number of recent publications have suggested ways to target and implement PES projects in order to maximize their cost-effectiveness and efficiency, and the Heredia Declaration (this issue) sets forth a list of agreed-upon principles concerning the use of PES schemes. One of those principles concerns the â€ø ebundlingâ€ of joint products of intact ecosystems in PES schemes in order to maximize the benefits to society. There have been several recent studies focusing on the degree of overlap between biodiversity and other ecosystem services and therefore the opportunities and constraints to bundling these services. Building on this idea, the bulk of this paper focuses on developing a method for selecting sites for PES where the main interest is to bundle biodiversity with other ecosystem services. We focus our analysis on Madagascar, a country with globally important biodiversity that is also beginning to explore the utility of PES as a conservation mechanism. Specifically, we assess the opportunities for bundling biodiversity conservation with carbon and water services at the national scale and identify where using PES to protect these areas of multiple benefits would be most cost-effective and efficient. This analysis identifies almost 30,000Â km2 â€” out of 134,301Â km2 â€” of natural habitat that could potentially meet biodiversity conservation goals and protect additional ecosystem services through a PES scheme. One of the places identified by our methodology corresponds to an ongoing conservation project that has already begun using payments from carbon emission reductions to protect standing forests and restore important biodiversity corridors â€” the Ankeniheny-Mantadia-Zahamena Biodiversity Conservation and Restoration Project. This project site was selected for its high biodiversity and carbon values, lending credibility to our spatial targeting methodology and providing a case study to draw insights on how multiple-benefit PES schemes can be implemented in biodiversity â€ø ehotspotsâ€ . In the discussion section of this paper we draw on experiences from this project to consider how many of the principles outlined in the Heredia Declaration affect implementation of PES schemes in Madagascar, providing lessons for similar countries experimenting with PES for biodiversity conservation.",2010,"2019-06-28 18:15:11","2019-06-28T18:15:11Z",NA,"2093–2107","","11",69,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Bundling; Carbon; Madagascar; Payments for ecosystem services; Water quality",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Technical assistance to complete vulnerability and adaptation assessments includes training of analysts, sharing of contemporary tools (e.g. simu- lation models), data and assessment techniques, information-sharing workshops and an international exchange programme for analysts. This chapter summarizes 14 African country studies (Botswana, Côte d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tan- zania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) assessing vulnerabilities to global climate change and identi- fying adaptation options. The analysis revealed that the participatingAfrican countries are vulnerable to global climate change in more than one of the following socio-economic sectors: coastal resources, agriculture, grasslands and livestock, water resources, forests, wildlife, and human health. This vul- nerability is exacerbated by widespread poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution, environmental degradation, natural resource mismanagement and dependence on rain-fed agricul- ture. A range of practical adaptation options were identified in key socio-economic sectors of the African nations analysed. However, underdeveloped human and institutional capacity, as well as the absence of adequate infrastructure, renders many traditional coping strategies (rooted in political and economic stability) ineffective or insufficient. Future African country studies should be more closely coordinated with development of national climate change action plans",2003,"2019-06-28 18:15:07","2019-06-28T18:15:07Z",NA,"93–113","","",8,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"adaptation; africa; agriculture; forests; global climate change; health; vulnerability; wa-",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reconstructing historical changes in human-derived fire regimes em- pirically is challenging, but information is available on the timing of key human innovations and on current human impacts on fire. Here we incorporate this knowledge into a spatially-explicit fire propa- gation model. We explore how changes in population density, the ability to create fire, and the expansion of agro-pastoralism altered the extent and seasonal distribution of fire as modern humans arose and spread through Africa. Much emphasis has been placed on the positive effect of population density on ignition frequency but our model suggests this is less important than changes in fire spread and connectivity that would have occurred as humans learned to light fires in the dry season, and to transform the landscape through grazing and cultivation. Different landscapes show different limita- tions; we show that substantial human impacts on burned area would only have started ∼4000 BP in open landscapes, whereas they could have altered fire regimes in closed/dissected landscapes by ∼40,000 BP. Dry season fires have been the norm for the last 200-300 KY across all landscapes. The annual area burned in Africa probably peaked between 4 and 40 KYA. These results agree with recent paleo-carbon studies that suggest that the biomass burned today is less than in the recent past in sub-tropical countries.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:15:06","2019-06-28T18:15:06Z",NA,"847–852","","3",109,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Fire; Human ignition; Savanna; human evolution",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To bridge this gap, investigating complementarity and heterogeneity in functional traits within species groups or across trophic levels is particularly relevant. Such an understanding will then facilitate spatial mapping of areas of co-occurrence of multiple ecosystem services, as well as of critical trade-offs between monetized, cultural and other supporting ecosystem services that need to be considered as hard constraints to ecosystem management. In doing so, the nature and underpinnings of tradeoffs between bundles of ecosystem services accruing to different regions and groups of people, impacting equity and wellbeing, will be uncovered to support improved policy and land planning. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:14:39","2019-06-28T18:14:39Z",NA,"503–508","","5","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Allocating or using the flow of services is loaded with asymmetries, complex power dynamics and political struggles between groups of people. We argue that the issues associated with such allocation and use questions are poorly integrated into the literatures of resilience, sustainability, and vulnerability. To illustrate this, we focus on three socially constructed factors that inhibit a fuller understanding about how to sustain the flow of ecosystem services: (1) rigidity/poverty traps; (2) power asymmetries; and (3) scientization of policy/politicization of science. These factors limit our ability to assess the sustainable flows of ecosystem services, and in particular to better understand the trade-offs and limits to aggregate human activity. We demonstrate that an improved understanding of the allocation trade-offs and limits to the flows of ecosystem services could result from more applied research that integrates the developing fields of deliberative democracy, pragmatic environmental philosophy, and legitimacy and rule compliance. Without the understanding that such integration would bring, researchers and policy makers risk underestimating the limits on flows of ecosystem services and how to accomplish their provision toward the greater collective - rather than individual - good. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:14:38","2019-06-28T18:14:38Z",NA,"522–529","","2","21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agency; Deliberation; Ecosystem service; Philosophy; Resilience; Sustainability; Vulnerability",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The MA definition of a driver is any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in an ecosystem. A direct driver unequivocally influences ecosystem processes. An indirect driver operates more diffusely by altering one or more direct drivers. Global driving forces are categorized as demographic, economic, sociopolitical, cultural and religious, scientific and technological, and physical and biological. Drivers in all categories other than physical and biological are considered indirect.

"J76LD62S","book",2012,"Mayrand, Karel; Paquin, Marc","Payments for Environmental Services: A Survey and Assessment of Current Schemes","","","","","","Payments for environmental services (PES) are relatively new schemes seeking to support positive environmental externalities through the transfer of financial resources from beneficiaries of certain environmental services to those who provide these services or are fiduciaries of environmental resources. This report surveys PES schemes in the Western Hemisphere and analyzes the main differences and similarities between PES models as well as their strengths and limitations. In addition, the report identifies conditions for the success of PES schemes and highlights experiences that could emerge as best practices allowing PES to maximize their positive impacts both in terms of environmental and socioeconomic outcomes.1 The basic principle behind PES is that resources users and communities that are in a position to provide environmental services should be compensated for the costs of their provision, and that those who benefit from these services should pay for them, thereby internalizing these benefits. There is no commonly agreed definition of PES schemes, but a series of classifications based on the type of environmental services, the geographical scope, the structure of markets, or the types of payments involved. This lack of common definition/classification reflects the great diversity of existing models. However, it also generates some confusion and lack of clarity in the literature as to which schemes should be considered payments for environmental services. More than 300 PES schemes have been inventoried in the world. Most of them are recent or have been running for a few years only, and several PES schemes remain experimental in scope or are still in their pilot phase. Consequently, there are few empirical studies that document best practices and lessons learned. However, some initial lessons and emerging best practices have been documented. The survey of PES schemes conducted for this report shows that a multiplicity of models coexists and that no single one has so far emerged as a standard. Moreover, PES schemes are usually adapted to the very specific conditions under which they are established and to the specific characteristics of markets for different environmental services (watersheds, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, landscape beauty). One finding of this report is that PES schemes may not constitute a cost-optimal instrument in all circumstances. Indeed, their success depends in great part from pre-existing conditions. PES systems work best when services are visible and beneficiaries are well organized, and when land user communities are well structured, have clear and secure property rights, strong legal frameworks, and are relatively wealthy or have access to resources. PES schemes focus on those environmental services for which there is an existing market demand, or for which such demand can emerge under appropriate conditions.

A feasibility study based on three European long-term socio-ecological research platforms","Ecological Economics","","09218009","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.11.013","","Effective policies to slow the rate of anthropogenic biodiversity loss should reduce socioeconomic pressures on biodiversity, either directly or by modifying their underlying socioeconomic driving forces. The design of such policies is currently hampered by the limited understanding of socioeconomic drivers of and pressures on biodiversity as well as by lacking data, indicators and models. In order to improve understanding of these issues we here propose a conceptual model of socioeconomic biodiversity drivers and pressures. The model is based on the drivers-pressures-impacts-states-responses (DPSIR) scheme and on the socioeconomic metabolism approach. The aim of the model is to guide research aimed at improving our understanding of socioeconomic biodiversity pressures and drivers and to serve as a basis for the development of formal, quantitative models in that field. Based on three European long-term socio-ecological research (LTSER) platforms, we analyze the model's applicability and suitability as well as data availability and research needs. These platforms are the Danube Delta Wetland System in Romania, the Doñana in Spain and the Eisenwurzen in Austria. An empirical analysis of the relationship between the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) and breeding bird richness in the Eisenwurzen demonstrates the ability of HANPP to provide a link between socioeconomic pressures/drivers and biodiversity. The analysis of the case studies underlines the potential utility of the conceptual model to guide future research into socioeconomic biodiversity drivers and pressures. However, considerable investments in monitoring and reconstruction of past trajectories as well as in model development will be required before mathematical (computer) models of the interrelation processes between society and ecosystems can be successfully deployed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper applies five principles of O'Hara's political economy (POPE): historical specificity; circular and cumulative causation; uneven development; heterogeneous agents; and contradiction. POPE provides a practical tool for scrutinising the interdependent aspects of a problem. The culture of conspicuous consumption for ivory is a key historical driver of demand. Yet a core, integrated factor that helps explain the current crisis relates to the principle of uneven development. The role of uneven development can be indirect, through lack of human development causing high crime and corruption rates, weak policy frameworks and conflicts in land ownership. Further, heterogeneity of agents adds to the complexity of the networks engaged in the decimation of elephants. Linked to the poaching-trafficking circuit of heterogeneous agents, this paper identifies two specific elephant contradictions between the market forces of durable fixed capital and environment-elephant capital.

The agroecological zones of WCA are closely related to the agro climatic zones of the region with rainfall decreasing from the southern coast in the forest region to the sub humid and semi arid Sahelian region in the north. The major agroecosystems of WCA include the semi arid, sub humid, humid forest, and swamp. Growing populations, inappropriate agricultural practices and changing climate in the region are influencing the composition and ability of agroecosystems in providing much needed ecosystem services.

Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.",2005,"2019-06-28 18:14:22","2019-06-28T18:14:22Z",NA,"1–100","","","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 2472066",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is no doubting that the natural world provides mankind with the majority of the resources required to sustain life and health. Many species provide food, fuel, medicines; with the potential for many more (as of yet) undiscovered uses for various species. Despite this, there have been very few attempts to actually investigate relationships between biodiversity (i.e. number of species, rather than the ability of specific species to provide health benefits) and human health. This paper reviews the available evidence and demonstrates that while the links between biodiversity and health seem intuitive, they are very difficult to prove. Socio-economics has a huge influence on health status and the exploitation of natural resources (leading to eventual biodiversity loss) tends to have a positive economic effects. More direct effects of biodiversity on health include the diversity of the internal microbiome, the effect of natural diversity on our mental health and well-being (although this has large social aspects with many people feeling fearful in very diverse environments). Still to be elucidated are the tipping points where the level of global biodiversity loss is such that human health can no longer be sustained.

A sociological study was undertaken using qualitative and quantitative methods. Microbial contamination of water and fish in the lake was assessed in 14 water and 60 fish samples in Mwanza. In Jinja, assessment of microbial contamination was carried out in 100 water and 26 fish samples. A total of 80 Nile tilapia were collected from Kisumu, Homabay and Suba and examined for gross pathological lesions using standard necropsy techniques. Findings from the sociological studies indicated that, the knowledge and awareness on endocrine disruptors in the region is low. Pollutants that find access into the lake and have potential for disrupting the endocrine systems exist in all cities and originate from point and non-point sources. Human, industrial, agricultural, hospital and domestic wastes are the main sources of pollutants likely to contain endocrine disruptors. These pollutants are handled poorly and most of them are disposed off into the lake without treatment. In Mwanza, contamination of water with faecal material at various landing sites was observed in 85.7%, 78.6% and 35.7% of the samples determined using Total Viable Counts, Total Coliform Counts and Total Faecal Coliform Count. All water samples were negative for Salmonella spp, Vibrio spp, Cryptosporidia spp and Giardia spp. In Jinja, microbial contamination was observed in all sampling sites as determined by aerobic plate count (APC), Total Coliform Count (TCC) and Escherichia coli count. There was no significant difference in microbial load between sampling sites (P \textgreater 0.05).

The interest is to shed light about the fundamental causes of agrobiodiversity loss by focusing upon the institutional or meso-economic environment that mediates farmersâ€™ decentralized decisions. Since the main causes of farmersâ€™ decisions to â€˜disinvestâ€™ in agrobiodiversity as an asset lie in the incentives offered by current markets and other institutions, the solution to the problem also lies in corrective institutional design. This paper discusses the institutional issues involved in establishing market-like mechanisms for agrobiodiversity conservation. Three steps are highlighted in such process: demonstration (valuation), capture and sharing of conservation benefits (mechanism design). This information is then used to examine the potential success of nascent market creation incentive mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, including: (i) payments/rewards for ecosystem services, (ii) direct compensation payments, (iii) land use development rights, and (iv) auctions for biodiversity conservation. The potential gains to society from their use with regard to agrobiodiversity conservation are discussed and some illustrative examples involving their application in different parts of the world are also described.",2007,"2019-06-28 18:14:11","2019-06-28T18:14:11Z",NA,"256–268","","3","121",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agrobiodiversity; Institutional design; Market creation; Meso-economy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Substantial absorption and accumulation of residues was observed for the cowpeas grown in two different sites, namely, in the coastal province Mombasa and highland region, Nairobi. The degree of uptake varied with soil type and growing conditions. Total residue levels ranging from 0.945??0.040 mg/kg to 7.765??0.211 mg/kg were obtained for 2 to 12 week old Mombasa plants. However, Nairobi plant values fell in the range of 1.136??0.038 mg/kg to 3.239??0.007 mg/kg. The Mombasa plants gave a range of residue levels from 0.800??0.065 mg/kg to 6.110??0.038 mg/kg and 0.084??0.001 mg/kg to 1.390??0.003 mg/kg for extractable and non-extractable (bound) residue, respectively. The corresponding values for Nairobi samples were 1.034??0.011 mg/kg to 2.241??0.014 mg/kg and 0.080??0.002 mg/kg to 0.411??0.007 mg/kg, respectively. Further, results suggest that the higher the water retention by the soil, the higher the rate of evaporation of DDT. Extractable DDT in soils decreased with temperature while soil-bound DDT increased with temperature. Coastal region soil-p,p'-DDT samples indicated p,p'DDE to be the major metabolite over a period of 292 d. The levels of DDT decreased with time. The reverse was true for DDE, as expected. First order rate constant for DDT dissipation in soils was confirmed by half-life measurements. The rate constants (k), calculated from the data, for Mombasa and Nairobi, were 5.6 x 10-6 min-1 and 5.1 x 10-6 min-1, respectively. Within a period of 90 d, DDT residue in the plants ranged from 0.94 to 7.73 mg/kg, while that in soils ranged from 88.9 to 32.0 mg/kg.",1999,"2019-06-28 18:14:04","2019-06-28T18:14:04Z",NA,"479–487","","4","25",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"BSJN4MHE","book",2011,"van Vliet, N.","Livelihood alternatives for the unsustainable use of bushmeat","","92-9225-388-3","","","","In tropical areas worldwide, the use of wildlife has important livelihood aspects and serves multiple roles. Wildlife products are often major items of consumption or display and have high medicinal and spiritual values in many human cultures (Scoones et al., 1992). The meat of wild animals has long been a part of the staple diet of forestdwelling peoples (Elliott et al., 2002). Bushmeat remains a primary source of animal protein for the majority of forest families (Wilkie et al., 2005), and can also constitute a significant source of revenue (Milner-Gulland et al., 2003), particularly where the trade is driven by increased bushmeat consumption in urban areas. Besides, bushmeat also plays a special role in the cultural and spiritual identity of indigenous peoples. Acquisition of animal parts as cultural artefacts, for personal adornment or for hunting trophies is still a widespread practice throughout tropical forest regions and the rest of the world (Nasi et al., 2008). Estimates of bushmeat harvest across the Congo Basin range between one (Wilkie & Carpenter, 1999) and five million tonnes per year (Fa et al., 2003) with harvest rates appraised at between 23 and 897 kg/km2/year (Nasi et al., 2008). In the Brazilian Amazon, subsistence hunters have been estimated to harvest some 23.5 million individual animals annually for food (Bennett & Robinson, 2000) with the yearly market value of wild game meat harvested by rural population estimated at US$ 191 million, second only to timber as a forest product (Peres 2000a; Peres 2000b). In Asia, the true scale and value of the wildlife trade are unknown, as much of the trade is carried out through informal networks, and not documented in government statistics (TRAFFIC, 2008). Many countries in the region including, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Vietnam, act as major sources of wildlife that is traded and consumed. There is compelling evidence that the scale of current hunting is a serious threat to many forest species and ecosystems. Local extirpation of hunted species is widespread, with West and Central Africa particularly affected (Milner-Gulland et al., 2003). Many large animals have already gone ecologically extinct in vast areas of neotropical forest areas (Redford, 1992). Hunting is (like other human extractive activities in tropical forests), depending on the scale, a disruptive process. It can and does trigger numerous indirect effects, which in turn alter both (i) the hunted populations and (ii) the functioning, structure and composition of the ecosystem (Nasi et al., 2010). The loss of wildlife from forest ecosystems can lead to the disruption of ecological and evolutionary processes, through changes in species composition within ecosystems and a general reduction in biological diversity (Emmons, 1989",2011,"2019-06-28 18:14:02","2019-06-28T18:14:02Z",NA,"","47","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,60,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We reviewed historical trends in coffee production and interviewed 100 coffee growers in 1999 to determine current management practices and attitudes toward the cultivation of sun and shade coffee in Puerto Rico. We discuss the outlook for the coffee industry in the 21st century and implications for biodiversity conservation, hoping lessons from Puerto Rico will apply to the international coffee industry. Throughout the 20th century, government intervention, including subsidies and technical assistance, supported coffee farming in Puerto Rico. In an effort to modernize coffee production and increase yields, the conversion from shade to sun coffee plantations was encouraged. Despite government support, the amount of land devoted to this once dominant agricultural commodity declined markedly between 1982 and 2007 (84%), due to labor shortages, low income, and catastrophic hurricanes. We found that a return to shaded plantations would be embraced by most farmers. Growers of shaded coffee were generally happier with their cultivation practices (89.3% satisfied) than growers of sun coffee (60.9% satisfied), valued biodiversity, and were willing to cultivate coffee under shade if given similar incentives to those received for farming sun coffee. The future of the coffee industry in Puerto Rico may depend on government programs that capitalize upon emerging markets for sustainably produced, shade-grown coffee. We conclude that where governments have close ties to the coffee industry, they should strive to wed economic development with the conservation of biodiversity and associated ecological services by providing support and incentives for the production of shade coffee.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:13:52","2019-06-28T18:13:52Z",NA,"164–170","","0","149",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Farmer attitudes; Puerto Rico; Shade coffee",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For this purpose an empirical study was carried out in two National Parks of Northern Greece. Three scenarios were proposed differing in the management options (regulatory, market-based and community-based scenarios) and the payment mechanism. Our empirical results show that social capital variables, especially social norms and social trust, have a strong influence both on the decision of individuals to pay and the specific amount stated. Specifically, we find that social norms have a positive influence for the willingness to pay (WTP) of individuals of a state-tax and an entrance fee (regulatory and market-based scenario respectively). Furthermore, social trust has a positive impact for the WTP through an entrance fee and a community tax (market-based and community-based scenario respectively). We also find a higher WTP of individuals towards the market based scenario where participation of citizens is higher compared to the current management status. Concerning the impact of demographic factors, we find that income does not influence the specific amount stated by individuals.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:13:50","2019-06-28T18:13:50Z",NA,"","","0","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Greece; Social factors; Willingness to pay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We define land degradation as a long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, which may be assessed using long-term, remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Deviation from the norm may serve as a proxy assessment of land degradation and improvement - if other factors that may be responsible are taken into account. These other factors include rainfall effects which may be assessed by rain-use efficiency, calculated from NDVI and rainfall. Results from the analysis of the 23-year Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI data indicate declining rain-use efficiency-adjusted NDVI on ca. 24% of the global land area with degrading areas mainly in Africa south of the equator, South-East Asia and south China, north-central Australia, the Pampas and swaths of the Siberian and north American taiga; 1.5 billion people live in these areas. The results are very different from previous assessments which compounded what is happening now with historical land degradation. Economic appraisal can be undertaken when land degradation is expressed in terms of net primary productivity and the resultant data allow statistical comparison with other variables to reveal possible drivers",2008,"2019-06-28 18:13:47","2019-06-28T18:13:47Z",NA,"223–234","","3","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Global relationships; Land degradation; Net primary productivity; Normalized difference vegetation index; Rain-use efficiency",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A review of MBIs â€“ including payments for ecosystem services, taxes and subsidies, mitigation or species banking, certification, etc. â€“ clearly shows that this label encompasses an extremely diverse array of instruments. Their only shared characteristic might be the attribution of a price to nature, yet in different ways and not necessarily in conjunction with economic valuations of the benefits/impacts associated with biodiversity and ecosystem services. Their links with markets are often loose, at least contrasted if not questionable in many cases. This pleads for a better lexicon of such a large collection of policy instruments in order to better inform policy making. This lexicon is based on the links between MBIs, economic theory, and markets. It includes six generic categories: regulatory price signals, Coasean-type agreements, reverse auctions, tradable permits, direct markets, and voluntary price signals. As a matter of illustration, â€ø ePayments for Ecosystem Servicesâ€ refer to various instruments in the literature and in practice. Depending on the context they could fit in all of our categories but one, so that we wonder if the term itself is not emptied of any useful meaning at least from an operational perspective. Last, the diversity of MBIs with regard to their functioning and links with markets seems to disqualify any general statement, be it in favour or against their development.

The specific aim of the study was to evaluate whether or not acidic atmospheric pollution poses a threat to soils, plants and water bodies of South Africa. To address this aim, a network of 37 passive sampling sites was established to measure monthly mean concentrations of near-surface SO(2), NO(2) and ozone. The area covered extended over the northern and eastern interior of South Africa while avoiding sources of local emissions such as towns, mines and highways. The field campaign was conducted between August 2005 and September 2007. Spatial distributions and temporal trends for these pollutant gases were assessed. Critical levels analysis comparisons were made against applicable air quality standards, guidelines and limits to evaluate the potential for adverse atmospheric pollution impacts on regional environments.

South Africa is known to have used and abused most chemicals listed by developed and developing countries as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been reported in water, sediment and serum, as well as in fish tissue samples, at a level that could trigger endocrine disruption in humans and wildlife. Although some monitoring has been reported, particularly in water systems within the country, information on EDCs in other environmental matrices is scanty. The water systems monitored so far are very few. The strongest economy in Africa, and an emerging world economy depending on agriculture, mining, manufacturing and industry, needs to focus more on monitoring and to strengthen government organs and institutions to monitor and ensure environmental safety.

On the basis of well dated paleoecological records from Lake Malawi, which reflect both local and regional conditions, we show that this aridity had severe consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. During the most arid phase, there was extremely low pollen production and limited charred-particle deposition, indicating insufficient vegetation to maintain substantial fires, and the Lake Malawi watershed experienced cool, semidesert conditions (\textless400 mm/yr precipitation). Fossil and sedimentological data show that Lake Malawi itself, currently 706 m deep, was reduced to an approximately 125 m deep saline, alkaline, well mixed lake. This episode of aridity was far more extreme than any experienced in the Afrotropics during the Last Glacial Maximum (approximately 35-15 ka). Aridity diminished after 95 ka, lake levels rose erratically, and salinity/alkalinity declined, reaching near-modern conditions after 60 ka. This record of lake levels and changing limnological conditions provides a framework for interpreting the evolution of the Lake Malawi fish and invertebrate species flocks. Moreover, this record, coupled with other regional records of early Late Pleistocene aridity, places new constraints on models of Afrotropical biogeographic refugia and early modern human population expansion into and out of tropical Africa.",2007,"2019-06-28 18:13:33","2019-06-28T18:13:33Z",NA,"16422–7",NA,"42",104,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17925446",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Air Conditioning; Animals; Disasters; Ecology; Fishes; Fossils; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Humidity; Paleontology; Population; Tropical Climate",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gaps in in situ data have so far prevented a full assessment of the response of Lake Chad to the ongoing prolonged drought that started in the second half of the 20th century. Like many other wetlands and shallow lakes, the 'Small' Lake Chad includes large areas of water under aquatic vegetation which needs to be accounted for to obtain the total inundated area. In this paper, a methodology is proposed that uses Meteosat thermal maximum composite data (Tmax) to account for water covered by aquatic vegetation and provide a consistent monthly time series of total inundated area estimates for Lake Chad. Total inundation patterns in Lake Chad were reconstructed for a 15-yr period (1986-2001) which includes the peak of the drought (86-91) and therefore provides new observations on the hydrological functioning of the 'Small' Lake Chad. During the study period, Lake Chad remained below 16,400km2 (third quartile ???8800km2). The variability of the inundated area observed in the northern pool (standard deviation ??northernpool=1980km2) is about 60% greater than that of the southern pool (??southernpool=1250km2). The same methodology could be applied to other large wetlands and shallow lakes in semi-arid or arid regions elsewehere using Meteosat (e.g. Niger Inland Delta, Sudd in Sudan, Okavango Delta) and other weather satellites (e.g., floodplains of the Lake Eyre Basin in Australia and Andean Altiplano Lakes in South America). ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:13:31","2019-06-28T18:13:31Z",NA,"87–98",NA,"1-2",404,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Drought; Global change; Remote sensing; Water resources",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the environmental impacts on population vital rates and the simultaneous effects of anthropogenic disturbances on exploited populations have been poorly studied. We assessed harvesting impacts on the population dynamics of Himatanthus drasticus (Mart.) Plumel, a Brazilian savanna tree that has been exploited for its medicinal latex. We studied populations in the cerrado (open savanna) and in the cerradão (woodland), for three years (2008-2010). In each habitat, we surveyed populations subjected to different harvesting intensities (high-harvest and low-harvest). The diameter at ground level (DGL), height and reproductive status were recorded for each tagged plant. We used matrix population models and a factorial life-table response experiment (LTRE) to distinguish between the effects of harvesting intensity and habitat type on H. drasticus population dynamics. The different factor combinations revealed population stability in most cases. We observed a population reduction under only one condition (cerradão×. high-harvest) in one of the two demographic intervals. The LTRE values for the interaction cerradão×. high-harvesting were higher than the values of each treatment isolated, suggesting an interactive effect of harvesting and habitat on the population growth rates. In sum, our data showed that H. drasticus harvesting is potentially sustainable; however, cerradão populations were vulnerable when high levels of exploitation were considered, indicating that management criteria specific to each studied habitat are needed to achieve sustainable harvesting goals. We recommend the traditional management system, characterized by the removal of small amounts of bark from each tree and by longer intervals between harvestings, as the management option for these areas.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:13:27","2019-06-28T18:13:27Z",NA,"177–184",NA,"",354,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cerrado; Forest management; Latex; Matrix models; Non-timber forest products; Population dynamics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

International non-governmental organizations and media often attribute the basic problem to China's domestic ivory market. We present quantitative and qualitative information on trends and drivers of the ivory trade in China. Results show that ivory is traded in ""white"" legally licensed retail outlets, ""black"" illegal shops and online trade forums, and ""gray"" live auctions of uncertain legality. White markets are primarily in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The numbers of legal factories and retail outlets increased from 9 and 31 in 2004 to 37 and 145 in 2013. Black markets thrive in online trading platforms, such as Baidu Post Bar. Gray markets auction ivory items surging around 2006, mushrooming after 2009, peaking in 2011, and plummeting over 97% following government intervention. During 2002 to 2011, the ivory auction in China and elephant poaching in Africa are strongly positively correlated. Drivers of the ivory trade are multiple and complex, including Chinese consumers' motivation stemming from the socially-constructed economic, social, cultural, aesthetic, religious, and medical values of ivory. We highlight China's intangible cultural heritage preservation, the boom of arts investment, and the auction ban in changing ivory values and influencing markets. We argue that elephant conservation can be more effective if it is based on a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of China's domestic ivory trade.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:13:25","2019-06-28T18:13:25Z",NA,"23–30",NA,"",180,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"African elephant; China; Demand; Ivory trade; Market",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there are a number of data and conceptual limitations to using heuristic optimisation algorithms in the analysis of the cost-efficiency of PES.

The hypothesis of this paper is that rainfall patterns impact changes in income within our study region of central and northern Mozambique. Utilizing satellite-based estimates of rainfall analyzed within a GIS, we establish a 12-year rainfall climatology and calculate monthly rainfall anomalies for 419 villages during three growing seasons. We also approximate storm-total rainfall from tropical cyclones entering the Mozambique Channel. Hierarchical cluster analysis groups the villages according to the monthly rainfall anomalies and rainfall received from Cyclones Delfina and Japhet. Then, using data from the National Agricultural Survey of Mozambique conducted in 2002 and 2005, we relate rainfall and change in income through the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients and independent-samples t tests using village-groups produced by the cluster analysis. We find that no season closely approximates the 12-year climatology and that rainfall varied among the three seasons. Although most villages experience income declines, those affected by Delfina exhibit the worst economic performance, indicating that heavy rainfall from some tropical cyclones can have long-lasting negative effects on income. Additionally, receiving above-normal rainfall may hinder economic well-being more than below-normal rainfall. Our study identifies patterns in sub-national rainfall variability and economic well-being that enable a more detailed understanding of weather-related effects on socio-economic outcomes.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:13:21","2019-06-28T18:13:21Z",NA,"31–49",NA,"1",66,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Climate variability; Mozambique; Rainfall; Rural development; Tropical cyclones",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Considered from a livelihoods perspective, the balance sheet is more positive than has often been assumed. These positive dimensions have tended to be discounted in conservation strategies. Recent research is reviewed which illustrates the importance of bushmeat to the livelihoods of the poor. This perspective is also indicated when considering issues of forest governance.

This harvest is also considered among the greatest threats to biodiversity throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Economic development is often proposed as an essential first step to win–win solutions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation by breaking rural reliance on wildlife. However, increases in wealth may accelerate consumption and extend the scale and efficiency of wildlife har- vest. Our ability to assess the likelihood of these two contrasting outcomes and to design approaches that simultaneously consider poverty and biodiversity loss is impeded by a weak understanding of the direction and shape of their interaction. Here, we present results of economic and wildlife use surveys conducted in 2,000 households from 96 settlements in Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania, and Madagascar. We examine the individual and interactive roles of wealth, relative food prices, market access, and opportunity costs of time spent hunting on household rates of wildlife con- sumption. Despite great differences in biogeographic, social, and economic aspects of our study sites,wefound a consistent relation- ship between wealth and wildlife consumption. Wealthier house- holds consume more bushmeat in settlements nearer urban areas, but the opposite pattern is observed in more isolated settlements.

This is partly caused by insufficient knowledge about the economic and ecological value of mangrove ecosystems, which provide important ecosystem services, such as fish, flood prevention, erosion prevention, water regulation, and timber products. A strategy to improve mangrove ecosystem management would be to improve public understanding of the ecosystem's values. We studied these drivers on a regional scale, using socio-economic and grey literature and consultations with experts, thereby focusing on the period from 1980 to 2006. Wood harvesting, conversion of mangroves for agriculture, and bio-fuel plantations were important drivers of mangrove forest change. Coastal development is the most important direct driver of mangrove forest change, especially between 2000 and 2006, a period that coincides with large oil discoveries in the region. About 60% of all industries within the region are located near the coast, which is expected to attract about 50 million people by 2025. Future policies should target the risks of declining mangrove ecosystems in West-Central Africa. This requires focusing on adaptive strategies, reviewing existing coastal and marine ecosystem policies, and developing an integrated coastal management strategy for the region. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:13:04","2019-06-28T18:13:04Z",NA,"217–230",NA,"November",7,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"change; drivers of mangrove forest; ecosystem services; mangroves; sustainability; west-central africa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our results indicate small impacts in relatively productive regions, since land use remains largely unchanged. In marginal agricultural regions, however, decoupling is shown to have a negative impact on biodiversity and landscape mosaic because of the homogenisation of land use that results from land being taken out of production. Existing agri-environmental schemes and national support acted to buffer the full potential impacts of decoupling on landscape values in these regions.

Drylands cover about 41% of Earth's land surface, and 65% of their area supports domestic livestock that depends on the above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) of natural vegetation. Thus, understanding how biotic and abiotic factors control ANPP and related ecosystem functions can largely help to create more sustainable land-use practices in rangelands, particularly in the context of ongoing global environmental change. 2. We used 311 sites across a broad natural gradient in Patagonian rangelands to evaluate the rela-tive importance of climate (temperature and precipitation) and vegetation structure (grass and shrub cover, species richness) as drivers of ANPP, precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) and precipitation marginal response (PMR). 3. Climatic variables explained 60%, 52% and 12% of the variation in grass cover, shrub cover and species richness, respectively. Shrub cover increased in areas with warmer, drier and winter rainfall cli-mates, while the response observed for both grass cover and species richness was the opposite. Climate and vegetation structure explained 70%, 60% and 29% of the variation in ANPP, PUE and PMR, respectively. These three variables increased with increasing vegetation cover, particularly grass cover. Species richness also increased with ANPP, PUE and PMR. ANPP increased, and PUE decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation, whereas PMR increased with the proportion of precipitation fall-ing in spring–summer. Temperature had a strong negative effect on ANPP and PUE, and a positive direct effect on PMR. Standardized total effects from structural equation modelling showed that vegeta-tion structure and climate had similar strengths as drivers of ecosystem functioning. Grass cover had the highest total effect on ANPP (0.58), PUE (0.55) and PMR (0.41). Among the climatic variables, mean annual precipitation had the strongest total effect on ANPP (0.51) and PUE (À0.41), and the proportion of the precipitation falling in spring–summer was the most influential on PMR (0.36). 4.

From the ecological viewpoint, this diversity is of different kinds and has the potential to cater to human well-being in multifarious ways. However, the mix of services that is available to any economy from forests depends, in addition to their biological characteristics, on the nature of the economic regime within which they are exploited. Some commodities such as timber are extracted in a regime driven, in the main, by market forces. Others such as non-timber forest products may be extracted under a variety of arrangements, the range varying from open access to common property regimes. Services such as those of water cycle augmentation and micro-climate regulation are typically available to communities as free goods. It is hypothesized that this difference in institutional regimes has implications for the mix of products and services that are extracted in different ways.â€¢ Through its effect on the extraction efforts for the marketed product. â€¢ Because of policies, such as plantation, which are intended to increase the supply of the marketed product, typically, timber. â€¢ Through a change in biodiversity of the forest stock which in turn results in a decreased availability of the non-marketed products. The present paper studies conditions under which timber has been extracted from forests of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) during the 1975â€“2000 period to examine this proposition. It is postulated that extraction of timber at any point of time depends on the stock, the effort involved in extraction (as represented by the per unit cost of extraction), the biodiversity index (defined as a product biodiversity index) and a variable depicting ecological characteristics of the forests. Using a modified Gordonâ€“Schaefer production function, and the assumption that forests are managed for â€ø esustainable timber extractionâ€ , the reduced form equations are derived and estimated using data from Uttar Pradesh forests for the 1975â€“2000 period. The results suggest that, in the absence of variables representing the plantation area and biodiversity-corrected stocks, the explanatory power of the model is low, even though extraction is seen to be significantly impacted by effort. If, however, the ratio of plantation area and biodiversity-adjusted extraction are introduced as explanatory variables, interesting results with respect to the trend of extraction over time are obtained. As stocks of woody biomass increase, extraction increases. A decrease in biodiversity of the stock may be accompanied, under a certain set of circumstances, with a rising trend in extraction, and at a rising rate as explained above. However, an increased biodiversity may imply a decreasing trend in the extraction in the future provided that present extraction Y does not rise at a rate faster than the rate of increase in the biodiversity. These two results seen together are, we believe, significant. They point to the fact that policies aimed at increasing plantation increase short-run timber extraction. Further, if biodiversity increases, the impact on future extraction of timber depends on relative rates of change in biodiversity and extraction per unit effort.

In Latin America, coffee is traditionally produced under a diverse and dense canopy of shade trees. The structural and floristic diversity contained therein harbors a high biodiversity of associated organisms. The recent trend of reducing this shade cover so as to increase production raises concerns about the potential loss of biodiversity. This concern has given rise to a variety of conservation programs, including shade coffee certification, a market-based conservation strategy. Shade coffee certification programs offer the opportunity to link environmental and economic goals. Although the idea of shade certification is to compensate farmers for the biodiversity conservation service provided by their shaded plantations, the premium offered may not compensate for the low yields of the most shaded plantations. Here we present an approach for guiding the establishment of premium prices for coffee producers based on scientific information that relates shade percentage and levels of species richness with yield. Partial data from two separate studies in Chiapas, Mexico, are combined and used to illustrate this approach. In addition, further theoretical explorations are made by adapting an intercropping model and using coffee yield and biodiversity (as it relates to percent of shade of canopy trees) as the two relevant variables. This model is examined qualitatively from the point of view of optimality (balancing biodiversity preservation with production). Results suggest that price premium for shade certification should be high and go directly to the producers, especially if the intent is to conserve forest-sensitive species.",2005,"2019-06-28 18:12:54","2019-06-28T18:12:54Z",NA,"435–446",NA,"4",54,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agroforestry; Biodiversity; Coffee certification programs; Yield set",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rising incomes lead to dietary changes, from staple crops, towards commodities with greater land requirements, e.g. meat and dairy products. Despite yield improvements partially offsetting increases in demand, agricultural land has still been expanding, causing potential harm to ecosystems, e.g. through deforestation. We use country-level panel data (1961-2011) to allocate the land areas used to produce food for human consumption, waste and biofuels, and to attribute the food production area changes to diet, population and yields drivers. The results show that the production of animal products dominates agricultural land use and land use change over the 50-year period, accounting for 65% of land use change. The rate of extensification of animal production was found to have reduced more recently, principally due to the smaller effect of population growth. The area used for bioenergy was shown to be relatively small, but formed a substantial contribution (36%) to net agricultural expansion in the most recent period. Nevertheless, in comparison to dietary shifts in animal products, bioenergy accounted for less than a tenth of the increase in demand for agricultural land. Population expansion has been the largest driver for agricultural land use change, but dietary changes are a significant and growing driver. China was a notable exception, where dietary transitions dominate food consumption changes, due to rapidly rising incomes. This suggests that future dietary changes will become the principal driver for land use change, pointing to the potential need for demand-side measures to regulate agricultural expansion.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:12:52","2019-06-28T18:12:52Z",NA,"138–147",NA,"",35,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Dietary patterns; Food security; Land displacement; Land use",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, program costs and benefits to multiple stakeholders, and how they change through time, are rarely carefully analyzed. We examine one of China's new ecosystem service protection and human development policies: the Relocation and Settlement Program of Southern Shaanxi Province (RSP), which pays households who opt voluntarily to resettle from mountainous areas. The RSP aims to reduce disaster risk, restore important ecosystem services, and improve human well-being. We use household surveys and biophysical data in an integrated economic cost-benefit analysis for multiple stakeholders. We project that the RSP will result in positive net benefits to the municipal government, and to cross-region and global beneficiaries over the long run along with environment improvement, including improved water quality, soil erosion control, and carbon sequestration. However, there are significant short-run relocation costs for local residents so that poor households may have difficulty participating because they lack the resources to pay the initial costs of relocation. Greater subsidies and subsequent supports after relocation are necessary to reduce the payback period of resettled households in the long run. Compensation from downstream beneficiaries for improved water and from carbon trades could be channeled into reducing relocation costs for the poor and sharing the burden of RSP implementation. The effectiveness of the RSP could also be greatly strengthened by early investment in developing human capital and environment-friendly jobs and establishing long-term mechanisms for securing program goals.

We identify lack of understanding of the currencies used by animals in their foraging decisions and the spatial scale of these decisions as major constraints to better management. We conclude that there are important differences between domestic grazing animal species in their impact on grazed communities and that these can be related to differences in dental and digestive anatomy, but also, and probably more importantly, to differences in body size. Differences between breeds within species appear to be relatively minor and again largely related to body size.

In Africa, many cultures require animal parts for a wide range of traditional and religious practices. This has resulted in the persecution of more than 354 bird species across the continent. In this study, we evaluated the drivers and frequency of human-related avian mortality focusing on the trade in avian body parts around major protected areas in the Cross River region of southeastern Nigeria. We conducted personal interviews with men from 18 villages in proximity to four natural areas in the region, and asked the men questions related to their knowledge of trade in avian body parts. From the responses obtained, we identified 27 bird species from 13 families in regional trade. Three of the top 5 most reported species are globally threatened. Both knowledge of and participation in the trade were pervasive across the study sites and across different occupational groups. 94% of respondents claimed knowledge of trade in avian body parts; 66% had participated in that trade in the last 2. years. To identify predictors of participation in the avian body part trade, we fitted all possible model combinations using the Generalized Linear Mixed Model approach and ranked them based on their AICc values. The top-ranked model identified age, average monthly income, perceived personal need for avian body parts, and number of wives as the top socio-economic drivers of participation. Younger people and villagers with low monthly income were more likely to participate in the trade. Probability of involvement also increased with the number of wives and a perceived personal need for avian body parts. The former may be an indication of a larger household that requires more resources to sustain it; the latter likely reflects personal conviction of the efficacy of using avian body parts in traditional medicine and other cultural practices.

These questions are used as a basis to compare three environmental management projects that aimed to integrate knowledge from different sources in the United Kingdom, Solomon Islands and Australia. Comparative results indicate that integrating different types of knowledge is inherently complex - classification of knowledge is arbitrary and knowledge integration perspectives are qualitatively very different. We argue that there is no single optimum approach for integrating local and scientific knowledge and encourage a shift in science from the development of knowledge integration products to the development of problem-focussed, knowledge integration processes. These processes need to be systematic, reflexive and cyclic so that multiple views and multiple methods are considered in relation to an environmental management problem. The results have implications for the way in which researchers and environmental managers undertake and evaluate knowledge integration projects. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010,"2019-06-28 18:12:31","2019-06-28T18:12:31Z",NA,"1766–1777",NA,"8",91,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 20413210",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental management; Knowledge integration; Local knowledge; Participatory research; Scientific knowledge; Social learning",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These initiatives are often politically driven and aspire to achieve both economic and environmental benefits. However, the lack of clarity about the precise objectives of these schemes means that they often fail to yield either local economic or global environmental benefits. There is often a failure to negotiate with all concerned stakeholders and to recognize and resolve trade-offs. Subsidies have often had perverse impacts, and market forces may be better drivers of economic objectives of restoration programmes. Security of tenure and use rights is an important but often neglected requirement for achieving sustainability. Remnant patches of natural vegetation, even when degraded, are often valuable sources of local biodiversity in restoration schemes. The spatial patterns of different types of forest and of non-forest land are important determinants of environmental values. Biodiversity conservation requires maintaining or re-establishing habitat strips to connect natural forest blocks and protect ecological gradients.

Following European settlement, however, major changes in resource availability for these predators potentially resulted in increased competition, especially for food. This study examined ecological attributes of both species, including intersexual differences in the sooty owl, potential resource partitioning and whether competition may be occurring. Dietary overlap was high between female sooty owls and powerful owls (0.90), compared to overlap between male sooty owls and powerful owls (0.67), with three mammalian species contributing over 74% of their diets. Sooty and powerful owls coexisted throughout the study region, regularly roosting within the same vegetation types, and in similar locations, although microhabitat differences were apparent. Sooty owls displayed aseasonal breeding, although a peak in fledging in spring coincided with powerful owl breeding. Both species exclusively nested in similar size mountain grey gums (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa), however, hollow characteristics differed slightly. Significant divergence along a single niche dimension was not detected between powerful and sooty owls, as they had similar diets, habitat usage and activity times, potentially resulting in competition. Reproductive output was low for both species, however, the degree to which competitive interactions influenced this remains unknown. To minimise potential competition, longterm feral predator control and improved habitat management is recommended to increase the density and diversity of small terrestrial mammals, as this should result in diversification of the sooty owl diet, reducing dietary overlap with powerful owls.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:12:23","2019-06-28T18:12:23Z",NA,"29–47","","1","61",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 59339963",NA,NA,NA,"2011; au; competition; cooke; corresponding author; deakin; e-mail; edu; koninklijke brill nv; leiden; ninox strenua; owl; raylene; resource partitioning; tyto tenebricosa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social– ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components—latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy—most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.",2004,"2019-06-28 18:12:21","2019-06-28T18:12:21Z",NA,"5","","2","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18129228",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper explores how the theory of collective action can provide a more synthetic understanding of how market chains operate, and the changes that could permit a more equitable distribution of benefits. The case studies illustrate the need for improved trust, mutual understanding of each actorâ€™s involvement, and an agreed process of collective action with a high level of community participation.

Maximizing water productivity, and not yield per unit of land, is therefore a better strategy for dry farming systems. Under such conditions, more efficient water management techniques must be adopted. Supplemental irrigation (SI) is a highly efficient practice with great potential for increasing agricultural production and improving livelihoods in the dry rainfed areas. In the drier environments, most of the rainwater is lost by evaporation; therefore the rainwater productivity is extremely low. Water harvesting can improve agriculture by directing and concentrating rainwater through runoff to the plants and other beneficial uses. It was found that over 50% of lost water can be recovered at a very little cost. However, socioeconomic and environmental benefits of this practice are far more important than increasing agricultural water productivity. This paper highlights the major research findings regarding improving water productivity in the dry rainfed region of West Asia and North Africa. It shows that substantial and sustainable improvements in water productivity can only be achieved through integrated farm resources management. On-farm water-productive techniques if coupled with improved irrigation management options, better crop selection and appropriate cultural practices, improved genetic make-up, and timely socioeconomic interventions will help to achieve this objective. Conventional water management guidelines should be revised to ensure maximum water productivity instead of land productivity. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The status of bush encroachment in Botswana's grazing areas.","Journal of environmental management","","03014797","10.1006/jema.2001.0486","","Foci points, which are currently intensified by increased anthropogenic activities, have resulted in vegetation changes in the cattle-dominated grazing areas of Botswana. Bush encroachment species–for instance Acacia tortilis, A. erubescens, A. mellifera, Dichrostachys cinerea, Grewia flava, and Terminalia sericea–are increasing in cover and density around foci points (e.g. water points and kraals) at the expense of the grass cover. A number of factors have the effect of encouraging the germination and survival of bush encroachment species. The practice of cattle husbandry and continual shifting of foci points within grazing areas have resulted in the spread of the distribution of bush encroachment species across the country. This is evidenced by the potential extent of 37,000 km2 (6.4% of Botswana) of darkened and near infrared (NIR) reflective bush encroached areas in 1994. This paper suggests that specific management strategies should be adopted to help overcome the bush encroachment problem, which is causing a significant reduction in the extent of Botswana's high quality rangeland. These strategies may vary from the enforced reduction of grazing intensity in areas identified as being heavily bush encroached to the selective management of opportunistic (communal) grazing in better quality predominantly grassland areas. Further work is however required to update this analysis and especially to consider trends since 1994-1995. While some work on the extent of woody cover and the further causes of bush encroachment is being undertaken under the SAFARI2000 project, more research is needed in specific areas to pinpoint causes and responses to the bush encroachment problem.",2002,"2019-06-28 18:12:08","2019-06-28T18:12:08Z",NA,"3–11","","1","64",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 11876072",NA,NA,NA,"Botswana; botswana; bush encroachment; foci points; management options; management options.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We chose migration as the topic for the first mini review because its global geographical scale makes migrating individuals particularly vulnerable to climate change, and at the same time, the process of migration has fundamental impacts on ecological processes and biodiversity. Movement is an integral part of the ecology of many animals, and it can affect individual fitness and popula-tion persistence by enabling foraging and predation, be-havioural interactions, and migration [1]. Migration, in particular, affects biodiversity at regional and global scales, and migratory animals affect ecosystem processes. Animals use predictable environmental cues for the timing and navigation of migration. A change in these cues will affect the phenology and extent of migration. Arrival date and hatching date are phenological markers in migrating birds, for example, that can be strongly af-fected by global warming. These dynamics have been in-corporated into a mathematical model recently [2]. Higher temperatures cause earlier appearance of the in-sect prey of hatchling birds, which exerts pressure on birds to breed earlier so that hatchling development co-incides with peak prey abundance. Advanced breeding is dependent on the arrival time of the adults at the breed-ing site, as well as the delay between arrival and the start of breeding. These traits can change synchronously or asynchronously, and a mismatch between prey abun-dance and hatching can cause population declines. The mathematical model [2] explores the dynamics of these interactions and their evolutionary trajectories, and it can explain patterns observed in European flycatchers. Conversely, departure from their non-breeding grounds in Africa also appears to occur earlier for at least some Palearctic migratory birds [3]. Hence, there is a global shift in departure and arrival times that affects migratory bird movement and local abundance as a result of cli-mate warming. Phenological shifts in migration of endothermic birds are linked to the abundance of their ectothermic prey. Although endotherms are also directly affected by changes in temperature, which affects their metabolic demands for thermoregulation, these direct effects are more pro-nounced in ectotherms. The body temperature and hence physiology of ectotherms such as invertebrates and fish is closely tied to environmental temperatures. Climate warming will therefore influence metabolism and other physiological processes directly in ectotherms, and this can have pronounced effects on movement and migration. The proximate mechanisms that enable movement are the physiological functions that provide energy to the muscles and the muscles themselves that transform chemical energy (ATP) to work. All physiological pro-cesses are influenced by temperature, to varying degrees and usually optimal physiological rates are achieved within a relatively narrow temperature range. At extreme low or high temperatures, cessation of physiological functions leads to mortality [4]. But even at more benign temperatures that nonetheless diverge from the optimal range, decreases in physiological performance increase ecological failure by impairing movement [5]. Hence, changing environmental temperatures, including changes resulting from anthropogenic global warming, impact migration and other ecological processes via the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes. A new theoretical model now suggests that in Chinook salmon, metabolic constraints exacerbate the effect of temperature on the metabolic costs of migration [6]. Salmon often migrate hundreds of kilometres from their natal riverine areas to the ocean and return to their natal areas for spawning. Salmon prefer relatively cool water, and increasing water temperatures compromise their cardiovascular and metabolic physiology [5]. If fish did not have to replenish metabolic substrates (in particular glycogen) during their migration, the effects of warm water could be mitigated by swimming through warm sections of river rapidly. However, the need to replenish",2015,"2019-06-28 18:12:03","2019-06-28T18:12:03Z",NA,"5","","1","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper explores the links between regional rainfall, hydrology and vegetation dynamics in the savannas and riverine forests of the lower Limpopo Valley, southern Africa, from 800. AD to the present, reviewing palaeoecological data (fossil pollen, spores, diatoms and lithology) from several hydrological systems in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa and Limpopo National Park (PNL), Mozambique. The PNL-KNP records show that riverine arboreal taxa expanded during wetter periods, including 800-1400. AD and after 1800. AD. Between 1400 and 1800. AD, grasses, savanna taxa and generalist taxa were favored over riparian taxa, a change that is linked with the onset of dry spells in the region (corresponding to the so-called Little Ice Age). The most extreme drought events around 1700. AD resulted in a marked decline of riparian forest taxa near Lake Mapimbi, KNP. In contrast, many water-scarce sequences away from the riverine environment, such as Radio Pan, Mafayeni Pan, Malahlapanga Pan and Lake Makwadzi show stable grassland vegetation throughout the last 1200. years. The results demonstrate the resilience of the grassland-savanna ecosystems to projected climate change with warmer and overall drier climate. The riverine forests are predicted to be more vulnerable especially as more extreme weather events are projected. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:12:02","2019-06-28T18:12:02Z",NA,"69–78","","","363-364",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Diatoms; Pollen; Savanna ecology; Southern Africa; Vegetation dynamics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Near to Kuruman, commercial farms have practiced rotational grazing for decades. In communal areas of former homeland Bophuthatswana, similar strategies were used prior to 1994. Nowadays, a continuous grazing system is common. We hypothesized that these changes in management affected soil properties. To test this, we sampled soils at communal and commercial land along a gradient with increasing distance to water points. The results revealed that communal systems with continuous grazing showed enlarged spatial gradients. The soils were depleted in most nutrients close to the water relative to those of commercial systems. In contrast, as the distance to the water increased, the nutrient stocks of these communal systems were higher. Changes in soil nutrient stocks were related to a zone of increased bush encroachment (up to 25%). Specific analyses (phosphorus fractions, particulate organic carbon, ??13C) confirmed that the soils of the communal grazing systems benefited from the shift of grass-dominated to bush-dominated system with woody Acacia vegetation, while the rangeland degraded in the sense that it lost palatable grass species.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:12:00","2019-06-28T18:12:00Z",NA,"14–25","","","120",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bush encroachment; Continuous grazing; Isotopic composition; Phosphorus fractions; Plant nutrients; Rangeland management; Rotational grazing; Soil organic carbon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use a 6-year satellite data record of fractional woody vegetation cover and an 11-year daily precipitation record to investigate the climatological controls on woody vegetation cover across the African continent. We find that-as opposed to a relationship with only mean annual rainfall-the upper limit of fractional woody vegetation cover is strongly influenced by both the quantity and intensity of rainfall events. Using a set of statistics derived from the seasonal distribution of rainfall, we show that areas with similar seasonal rainfall totals have higher fractional woody cover if the local rainfall climatology consists of frequent, less intense precipitation events. Based on these observations, we develop a generalized response surface between rainfall climatology and maximum woody vegetation cover across the African continent. The normalized local gradient of this response surface is used as an estimator of ecosystem vegetation sensitivity to climatological variation. A comparison between predicted climate sensitivity patterns and observed shifts in both rainfall and vegetation during 2009 reveals both the importance of rainfall climatology in governing how ecosystems respond to inter-annual fluctuations in climate and the utility of our framework as a means to forecast continental-scale patterns of vegetation shifts in response to future climate change.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:11:58","2019-06-28T18:11:58Z",NA,"4902–4907","","12","108",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21383125",NA,NA,NA,"Science & Technology - Other Topics; climate; cover; ecohydrology; intraannual variability; performance; potential; precipitation; quantile regression; rainfall; remote sensing; satellite; savannas; terrestrial ecosystems; tree cover; variability; vegetation indexes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, uncontrolled bushfires threaten this exceptional biodiversity. A science-based fire management policy could reduce the impact of unwanted fires and help facing climate change. However, to date, data on the location, extent, causal factors and spatial patterns of fires had not been collected. We compiled a 13-year-long (1999-2011) spatially-explicit fire database for NC using MODIS and Landsat data. Using boosted regression trees we disentangled the role of anthropogenic factors, physiography, weather and vegetation on fire activity. We also characterized the location of fires and the vegetation composition at the fire edges, in order to determine which ecosystems were especially vulnerable. Fire size distribution was typically asymmetric with many small fires (\textless10. ha) and very few large fires (\textgreater500. ha). Ignitions were preferentially located close to villages, cities or roads, at low elevation and linked to high values of fire weather index. Fires were larger at the end of the dry season and during El Niño events. Most fires were bushfires burning in savannas, thickets and maquis, while rainforests were rather 'avoided' by fire. However, bushfires generally propagated towards forests of high-conservation value, thus increasing the potential for forest edge erosion. As savanna-forest and maquis-forest mosaics are dominant in the landscape, we discuss the extent to which NC could become a 'fire trap' where fire cannot be easily extirpated. Based on our spatially-explicit information on fire activity, we make recommendations for a sustainable forest and fire management policy which would balance the traditional use of fire and the conservation of the most valuable ecosystems. In particular, it may help by reducing the damages of large and destructive bushfires ignited during drought peaks.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:11:56","2019-06-28T18:11:56Z",NA,"48–60","","","337",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation; Fire hazard; Maquis; New Caledonia; Rainforest; Savanna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current global lake threats arise from climate change, regional land degradation and semivolatile contaminants, and share the common feature that the atmosphere is the vector that spreads their impacts over large areas and to many lakes. The Great Lakes of Africa (Malawi, Victoria and Tanganyika) are particularly sensitive to these problems because of their enormous surface areas, slow water flushing rates, and the importance of direct rainfall in their water budgets. Their response times might be slow to yield a detectable change and, unfortunately, their recovery times might also be slow. It is possible for atmospheric effects to act antagonistically to the impacts of catchment change, but antagonistic effects could become synergistic in the future.

The purpose of the exercise was to increase the Bank's and partners' understanding of conflict sources and dynamics, and contribute to conflict sensitivity in programs and interventions. The study was conducted in cooperation with Somali and international partners. The study is presented in four reports: one overall report written by the World Bank's task team, and one report for each main region, researched and written by the Center for Research and Dialogue in Mogadishu (South-central); Puntland Development Research Center in Garowe (Puntland); the Academy for Peace and Development (desk study); and the Center for Creative Solutions (fieldwork) in Hargeysa (Somaliland). The study presented in this report was conducted as a World Bank Economic and Sector Work (ESW), analytical work conducted to contribute to policy and program development, and as such has undergone internal consultations and peer-reviews. Within the Bank, the report has benefited from support and advice from Makhtar Diop (Country Director for Somalia, Kenya and Eritrea), Karen Brooks (Sector Manager, AFTS2), Ian Bannon (Manager, CPR), and Peer Reviewers: Estanislao Gacitua-Mario (Senior Social Scientist, SDV), Alexandre Marc (Sector Manager, ECSSD) and Robert Ebel (Lead Economist, WBI).

Policy makers may perform defensive actions to protect biodiversity. These actions, however, may deeply modify the natural ecological dynamics so that the resulting equilibrium has different dynamic features with respect to the equilibrium that would have naturally emerged without human intervention. To investigate this issue more deeply, we analyze the impact that economic activity and environmental defensive choices can have on the natural ecological dynamics depending on whether agents care or do not care for biodiversity. Using an optimal growth model with pollution, in which biodiversity loss may be caused by the negative side-effects of aggregate production, we show that human action can modify the stability of the ecological fixed points. In particular, from the simple analytical formulations adopted in the paper, it emerges that â€“ when the levels of the species is sufficiently low at the fixed point and agents care for biodiversity â€“ human intervention may cause a stabilization of the fixed point and thus avoid the extinction of a species, even in the absence of defensive expenditures specifically finalized at the protection of that species. It follows that the protection of biodiversity (through the stabilization of the ecological system) may come at the cost of a change in the original features of the natural dynamics. Moreover, it is shown that a limit cycle may arise through a Hopf bifurcation from the interaction of the economic and ecological systems even though none of the two systems taken separately admits a limit cycle.",2005,"2019-06-28 18:11:48","2019-06-28T18:11:48Z",NA,"333–346","","3â€“4","189",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Defensive actions; Ecological dynamics; Economic growth",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present priority in the global-change community is to define the likely nature and extent of those impacts on biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems.

The way in which that is being initiated is to develop adaptation measures to respond to medium-term climate variability in the form of altered El Nino and similar cycles, and changes in the frequency of extreme events.

Additive partitioning of species diversity revealed clear contrasting patterns between TD and FD in the percentage of variabil-ity observed at each spatial scale. While most variability in TD was found at the larger scales, irregardless of organ-ism group and land-use type, most variability in FD was found at the smallest scale, indicating that species turnover among communities is much greater than functional trait turnover. Finally, we found that TD and FD did not vary consistently, but rather followed different trajectories that largely depended on the biotic group and the intensity of land-use transformation. Our results highlight that the rela-tionship of land use with TD and FD is highly complex and context-dependent. Abstract Land-use change is the major driver of biodi-versity loss. However, taxonomic diversity (TD) and func-tional diversity (FD) might respond differently to land-use change, and this response might also vary depending on the biotic group being analysed.

We review recent observational, experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies.

We argue that the desire for generalizations has, ironically, contributed to the frequent conflation of weather with climate, even within the scientific c ommunity. As a result, current predictions of ecological responses to climate change, and the design of experiments to understand underlying mechanisms, are too often based on broad-scale trends and averages that at a proximate level may have very little to do with the vulnerability of organisms and ecosystems. The creation of biologically -relevant metrics of environmental change that incorporate the physical mechanisms by which climate trains patterns of weather, coupled with knowledge of how organisms and ecosystems respond to these changes, can offer insight into which aspects of climate change may be most important to monitor and predict.

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defined biodiversity as comprising ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity, and decided for the ecosystem level as the basis for describing biodiversity. However, due to conceptual problems as much as to the lack of data, so far no comprehensive measurements of biodiversity have been developed. A single measure quantitatively describing biodiversity even seems out of reach due to the incommensurability of the three levels. This makes it impossible to directly base policy decisions on existing or future estimates of the â€ø etotal sizeâ€ of biodiversity. Instead, it is suggested to analyse the pressures threatening biodiversity, which can usually be measured quantitatively, and act as the interface between the socioeconomic driving forces behind them and the biological impacts. The drivers (physical primary drivers, politics and policies causing them as secondary and institutional structures as tertiary ones) do not only affect biodiversity, but a range of sustainability problems. The analysis permits to integrate biodiversity risks with broader environmental and sustainability policies, and thus to mainstream biodiversity preservation. Such an analysis is presented for Europe, naming pressures and driving forces and illustrating the close links between the causes of biodiversity pressures and other environmental problems.

Desertification affects large dryland areas around the world and is a major cause of stress in human societies. Here we review recent research on the drivers, feedbacks, and impacts of desertification. A multidisciplinary approach to understanding the drivers and feedbacks of global desertification is motivated by our increasing need to improve global food production and to sustainably manage ecosystems in the context of climate change. Classic desertification theories look at this process as a transition between stable states in bistable ecosystem dynamics. Climate change (i.e., aridification) and land use dynamics are the major drivers of an ecosystem shift to a "" desertified"" (or "" degraded"" ) state. This shift is typically sustained by positive feedbacks, which stabilize the system in the new state. Desertification feedbacks may involve land degradation processes (e.g., nutrient loss or salinization), changes in rainfall regime resulting from land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., precipitation recycling, dust emissions), or changes in plant community composition (e.g., shrub encroachment, decrease in vegetation cover). We analyze each of these feedback mechanisms and discuss their possible enhancement by interactions with socio-economic drivers. Large scale effects of desertification include the emigration of "" environmental refugees"" displaced from degraded areas, climatic changes, and the alteration of global biogeochemical cycles resulting from the emission and long-range transport of fine mineral dust. Recent research has identified some possible early warning signs of desertification, which can be used as indicators of resilience loss and imminent shift to desert-like conditions. We conclude with a brief discussion on some desertification control strategies implemented in different regions around the world. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:11:27","2019-06-28T18:11:27Z",NA,"326–344","","","51",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Desertification; Ecohydrology; Feedbacks; Land degradation; Overgrazing; Soil salinity",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given that grass invasions can substantially alter fire regimes, we studied grass distributions in a tropical dry forest 1-5 yr after selective logging, and experimentally tested the effect of forest fire on populations of invasive grasses. In unlogged forests and in microhabitats created by selective logging we found a total of four alien and 16 native grass species. Grasses covered 2% of unlogged and 4% of logged forest, with grass cover in logged forest concentrated in areas directly disturbed by logging; log landings and roads had relatively greater grass cover (37% and 17%, respectively) than did skid trails (10%) and felling gaps (8%). Total grass cover and grass species richness increased with canopy openness and were greatest in sites most severely disturbed by logging. The grass flora of these disturbed areas was composed mostly of native ruderal species (e.g., Digitaria insularis, Leptochloa virgata), a native bamboo (Guadua paniculata), and Urochloa (Panicum) maxima, a caespitose C4 pasture grass introduced from Africa. Urochloa maxima formed monodominant stands (up to 91% cover and 2-3 m tall) and grew on 69% of log landings and 38% of roads. To better understand the potentially synergistic effects of logging and fire on the early stages of grass invasion, we tested the effect of a 12-ha experimental fire on U. maxima populations in a selectively logged forest. Three years after the fire, the area covered by alien grass in burned forest increased fourfold from 400 m2 (pre-fire) to 1660 m2; over the same period in a logged but unburned (control) area, U. maxima cover decreased from 398 m2 to 276 m2. Increased canopy openness due to fire-induced tree mortality corresponded with the greater magnitude of grass invasion following fire. Selective logging of this dry forest on the southern edge of the Amazon Basin promotes alien grass invasion; when coupled with fire, the rate of invasion substantially increased. Recognition of the grass-promoting potential of selective logging is important for understanding the possible fates of tropical forests in fire-prone regions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, research to date has mostly focused on elucidating the effects of single climate change variables on individual species. Here, we use established meta-analysis techniques to synthesize the existing literature on the interactive effects of multiple climate change variables on trophic interactions. Results: Most of the studies included in our meta-analysis examined plant-insect herbivore interactions. We found that the majority of trophic interaction response variables (55%) displayed multiplicative reactions to interacting climate change variables while 36% and 9% displayed antagonistic and synergistic reactions, respectively. We also found that only one of six climate change variable pairings had consistent positive or negative effects on trophic relationships, largely because interaction type and magnitude were both highly context dependent across the pairings. Most notably, males and females frequently responded differently to interacting climate change variables, and the response strength frequently varied with the underlying nutrient load of the system. Conclusions: Our results suggest that trophic interactions commonly respond antagonistically to interacting climate change variables whereas synergistic and simple additive/multiplicative reactions are less common than previously thought. In addition, response type and magnitude are highly context dependent. These findings further suggest that in many cases, future ecosystem responses to climate change, whether positive or negative, may be dampened relative to predictions based on experiments that investigate the effects of single climate change variables on single species. However, there is a paucity of work that has focused on the effects of interacting climate change variables on dynamic biotic relationships, likely because such research requires complex experimentation.

The impact of these residues on wind erosion was not clearly established. The objective of this study is thus to quantify the actual amount of crop residues in traditional Sahelian fields and to determine their impacts on wind erosion by reference to a bare surface throughout the seasonal cycle over several years. At the beginning of the year during dry season, Sahelian farmers use to ""clean"" their fields, i.e. cut and lay flat on the soil surface any millet stalks still standing and yearly sprouts of shrubs. After this clearing, the crop residues cover (CRC) regularly decreases passing from 12% to less than 2% four months later. On traditional cultivated plot, crop residues efficiently prevent soil losses by wind erosion during the dry season and considerably reduce erosion fluxes at the beginning of the rainy season. However, for CRC lower than 2%, wind velocities were sufficient to produce important erosion even during dry season. A minimal cover rate of about 2% (100kgha-1) thus appears as critical to reduce wind erosion. This reduction is driven by the higher aerodynamic roughness length which increases the wind erosion threshold velocity. If field clearing is made in January, as currently done, the CRC just after clearing should be about 800kgha-1 to maintain CRC above 2% at beginning of the rainy season when wind velocities are the highest and wind erosion the most intense. Our results also demonstrate that during the second part of rainy season wind erosion is reduced, not so much due to vegetation development but rather to a decrease in the number and the intensity of high winds events. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:11:18","2019-06-28T18:11:18Z",NA,"205–214","","3","85",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aerodynamic roughness length; Crop residues cover; Millet field; Niger; Wind erosion",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Globally, this gave rise to three severe problems. First, because commodity prices are highly volatile, countries had to cope with large shocks, both positive and negative. Evidence suggests that the largest of these shocks were poorly managed, with negative shocks causing substantial contractions in output. Second, for various reasons, the rents generated by primary commodities have been associated with poor governance. Third, primary commodity dependence is associated with a substantially higher risk of civil war. The paper argues that Africa's current comparative advantage in primary commodities is often due, not to its intrinsic endowments or location, but to a poor investment climate that is policy-related. For the next decade, even if Africa embarks upon effective diversification, it will have to live with primary commodity dependence. There is an urgent task of reducing the problems that have to date been caused by such dependence. Many of the policies that could be effective require action by developed countries. The paper suggests a range of such policies, including making aid flows contingent upon commodity prices, and greater transparency in corporate payments of primary commodity rents to governments.",2002,"2019-06-28 18:11:16","2019-06-28T18:11:16Z",NA,"1–24","","April","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services idea is mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies.

Humans depend on natural systems to produce a wide variety of ecosystem goods and services, ranging from direct use of certain species for food or medicines to ecosystem functions that provide water purification, nutrient retention or climate regulation. Threats to biodiversity include habitat loss and fragmentation, the introduction of nonindigenous species, over-harvesting, pollution, changes in geochemical cycles and climate change. Sustaining biodiversity in the face of increasing human populations and increased human economic activity promises to be a major challenge. Economists have an important role to play in helping to develop and evaluate conservation strategies. Because biodiversity is at risk in large part because of human activity, finding ways to conserve biodiversity will come from better understanding and management of human affairs, not from better biology alone. Economists can help set priorities to allocate scarce conservation resources where they will do the most good.

Biodiversity conservation differs in many respects to the classical applications of tradable permits like emissions control. One particularity is that, even if the permit system maintains a constant total amount of species habitat, habitat turnover (the destruction of a habitat and restoration elsewhere) affects the ecosystem. Another particularity is that the restoration of habitats often takes much time, leading to time lags between the initiation of restoration activities and the time when restored habitat is available for trading. We use an agent-based model of a tradable permit market to study the influence of heterogeneous and dynamic conservation costs and habitat restoration time lags on key variables of the market, such as the costs incurred to the market participants and the amount of habitat turnover. Our results show that there may be trade-offs between these key variables. We also find that restoration time lags can lead to fluctuations in permit prices that reduce the efficiency of the permit market. We conclude that temporal lags deserve a careful analysis when implementing tradable permit systems for the preservation of natural habitats and biodiversity.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:11:06","2019-06-28T18:11:06Z",NA,"533–541","","3","70",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agent-based model; Biodiversity conservation; Environmental policy; Habitat restoration; Habitat turnover; Time lag; Tradable permits",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nature and human views of nature are rapidly evolving; our approach to biological invasions through biosecurity institutions and land management policies must evolve in tandem with these changes. We review three dimensions that are insufficiently addressed. First, biological invasions are culturally shaped and interpreted. Humans play a major role in the movement and nurturing of alien life, and esthetics, perception, and emotion are deeply implicated in the management of invasive species. What people fear or regret with invasive species are not their effects on nature per se, but their effects on a particular desired nature, and policymaking must reflect this. Second, biological invasions are not restricted to negative impacts. Invasions take place in landscapes where many natural conditions have been altered, so policy tools must recognize that invasive species are a functional, structural, and compositional part of transformed ecosystems. In some cases, native species benefit from changes in resource availability caused by invasions or from protections provided by an invasive plant. Finally, invasive species can help ecosystems and people to adapt to global change by maintaining ecosystem processes such as productivity, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling in a context of climate change or land cover transformations. While recognition is growing among ecologists that novel, invaded ecosystems have value, and while the on-the-ground application of biosecurity policies has of necessity adjusted to local contexts and other agendas, invasion biology could aid policymaking by better addressing the three complexities inherent in the three dimensions highlighted above. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:11:05","2019-06-28T18:11:05Z",NA,"165–169","","","42",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Alien invasive species; Biological invasion; Biosecurity; Culture; Positive impact; Weed policy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the contributions and spatial scales at which these drivers operate and interact are not fully understood, particularly in the developing world. The impact of both local management and landscape context on insect pollinators and natural enemy communities and on their capacity to deliver related ecosystem services to an economically important tropical crop, pigeonpea was investigated. The study was conducted in nine paired farms across a gradient of increasing distance to semi-native vegetation in Kibwezi, Kenya. Results show that proximity of fields to semi-native habitats negatively affected pollinator and chewing insect abundance. Within fields, pesticide use was a key negative predictor of pollinator, pest and foliar active predator abundance. On the contrary, fertilizer application significantly enhanced pollinator and both chewing and sucking insect pest abundance. At a 1. km spatial scale of fields, there were significant negative effects of the number of semi-native habitat patches within fields dominated by mass flowering pigeonpea on pollinators abundance. For service provision, a significant decline in fruit set when insects were excluded from flowers was recorded. This study reveals the interconnections of pollinators, predators and pests with pigeonpea crop. For sustainable yields and to conserve high densities of both pollinators and predators of pests within pigeonpea landscapes, it is crucial to target the adoption of less disruptive farm management practices such as reducing pesticide and fertilizer inputs. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:11:03","2019-06-28T18:11:03Z",NA,"2424–2431","","10","144",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bio-control; Farm management; Fruit set; Landscape context; Pollination; The developing world",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Roadside transects conducted in 1976 and 1988 were compared with surveys done from 2003-2005 in and around Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Staggering declines in abundance were found for seven of eight scavenging raptors surveyed. No Egyptian vultures were seen during recent transects. We compared trends between the ungulate migration and non-migration season among three land use types (reserve, buffer, and grazed) and among the species surveyed to establish the causes of declines in scavenging raptors. Large declines during the ungulate migratory period suggest that most scavenging raptor species are declining well beyond the area of study. For all species, except Hooded vultures, substantial declines outside of the reserve indicate an important role of land use change in causing observed declines. In addition, significant declines of populations of Gyps species in the reserve itself, especially during the migration season, provide evidence that human activities occurring in other parts of the species' range such as poisoning of carcasses may be causing their decline. Declines found in this study suggest that at a minimum African white-backed, Rüppell's, and Hooded vultures should be relisted as Vulnerable. Management actions that limit land use change around the reserve combined with a countrywide ban on carbamate pesticides will be important for conserving keystone members of the scavenging guild. Future research should further examine possible causes of these declines and quantify the effect of reduced scavenging raptor abundance on scavenging efficiency. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:11:02","2019-06-28T18:11:02Z",NA,"746–752","","2","144",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Land use; Masai Mara; Poisoning; Scavenger; Vulture",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Species that moved to lower Red List categories, or remained Least Concern, were classified as lower risk'; species that stayed in a threatened category, or moved to a higher category of risk, were classified as higher risk'. Twenty-four predictor variables were used to predict transitions, including intrinsic traits (species biology) and external conditions (human pressure, distribution state and conservation interventions). The model correctly classified up to 90% of all transitions and revealed complex interactions between variables, such as protected areas (PAs) versus human impact. The most important predictors were: past extinction risk, PA extent, geographical range size, body size, taxonomic family and human impact. Our results suggest that monitoring a targeted set of metrics would efficiently identify species facing a higher risk, and could guide the allocation of resources between monitoring species' extinction risk and monitoring external conditions.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:10:54","2019-06-28T18:10:54Z",NA,"20150928–","","1813","282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 26246547",NA,NA,NA,"Subject Areas; biodiversity; conservation; ecology; environmental science Keywords; human threats; mammals; random forest model",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extraction was estimated from the average number of animals consumed per person per year from anthropological studies that reported animal kills brought into settle- ments in the regions. We calculated extraction rates (kg/km2/year) for 57 and 31 mammalian taxa in the Congo and Amazon, respectively. We then examined the sustainability of these extraction rates by basin and by taxa, using extraction-to-production (E:P) mass-balance equations. Production (tonnes/year) was calculated as the product of r,,a (the intrinsic rate of natural increase), mammal biomass, and total area offorest in each region. Species exploitation rates at specific body masses were significantly greater in the Congo than in the Amazon. The E:P ratio for the Congo was 2.4, 30 times the Amazon's ratio of 0.081. Thus, Congo Basin mammals must annually produce approximately 93% of their body mass to balance current extraction rates, whereas Amazonian mammals must produce only 4% of their body mass. We calculated sustainability levels derived from Robinson and Redford's harvest modelfor each taxa. On a basin-wide level, 60% and none of the mammal taxa in the Congo and Amazon basins, respectively, were exploited unsustainably. To evaluate the effect of error on the estimates of E:P, we conducted a sensitivity analysis, which suggests that the mass- balance was most sensitive to error in standing stock but that our results are robust. We estimated that over 5 million tons of wild mammal meat feed millions in Neotropical (0.15 million) and Afrotropical (4.9 mil- lion) forests annually. Our Congo basin estimates are four times higher than those calculated for the region by other workers, and we conclude that the current situation of bushmeat extraction in African rain forests is more precarious than previously thought.",2002,"2019-06-28 18:10:53","2019-06-28T18:10:53Z",NA,"232–241","","1","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the stability of ecosystem productivity is only changed by those drivers that alter biodiversity, with a given decrease in plant species numbers leading to a quantitatively similar decrease in ecosystem stability regardless of which driver caused the biodiversity loss.

This has recently caused concerns about its water quality and impact on aquatic organisms and human beings. This study was justified by the need to generate baseline concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in surface sediment from selected sites in the lake and determine the influence of activities on their concentrations and potential risks to fish-eating birds living near the lake. Surface sediments (\textless30cm) from three different fish landing beaches, located 200m from the shore of Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria near Kisumu city, Homa Bay and Mbita (control) towns, were analysed. The total mean concentrations (in pgg-1drywt) were found to range from 17.4-812 (??dl-PCBs), 36.6-813 (??PCDDs) and 1.45-46.4 (??PCDFs).

Using data on numbers of endemic species weighted by overall threat status, we analyze the impact of agricultural productivity growth and agricultural land conversion in 27 countries on threats to mammal, bird and plant species over two time scales: one covering the period since agricultural and environmental records began, the other covering the last decade.

Climate change has also impacted public health (i.e., altered distribution and increased prevalence of allergies, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases). Rapid human population growth has exacerbated pressure over coupled social-ecological systems, with concomitant non-sustainable impacts on natural resources, water availability, food security and sovereignty, public health, and quality of life, which should increase vulnerability and erode adaptation and mitigation capacity.

It notes that the current development trajectories and choices made by African countries both individually and collectively will have direct impacts on people and nature. These impacts will touch not only on inclusivity but also on the sustainability of the natural resources and ecosystem services that anchor economic growth. The report shares well examined perspectives of the pressures and drivers of Africa's economic fortunes over the next 50 years. It provides detailed analysis of population trends, urbanization, changing consumption patterns, investment levels as well as the role of the global economy in both African agriculture and extractives. Trends in these areas, as well as in those in the infrastructure domain, will have implications on the quality and ecological sustainability of Africa's growth. It is our conviction that appreciation of the development trajectories and their relationship with primary resources; the water -agriculture-energy-extractives nexus and their impacts on natural resource endowments, is critically important for planning for inclusivity and sustainability. It is pertinent to consider what Africa's economic development means for its ecological systems. Development planners must take these implications into account to ensure sustainable outcomes. This report has systematically treated this very fluid and dynamic subject by considering and analyzing critical drivers of various economic objectives in key development sectors that will steer Africa's progress in the next 50 years and beyond.",NA,"2019-06-28 18:10:19","2019-06-28T18:10:19Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Estimates suggest that about 10 million ha of forest may have been lost in the 20th Century, and around 80% of the original forest area is now an agriculture-forest mosaic. These highly modified forests provide food, fuel, fibre and a range of ecosystem services for over 200 million people. As a consequence, the future of biodiversity in the region is intimately linked with the lives and livelihoods of local people. The available evidence suggests that forest loss and degradation has been caused primarily by agricultural expansion, sometimes facilitated by other human activities such as wood extraction. This expansion is a response to the demand generated by a growing and increasingly urbanised human population, but has been exacerbated by small increases in crop yields over recent decades. We synthesize and review our state of knowledge on the value of human-modified habitats for forest biodiversity in the region. Data on biodiversity are patchy, but we show that across plant, invertebrate and vertebrate groups, there is a significant loss of forest species as tree cover is reduced and vegetation structure simplified. Agricultural expansion clearly causes significant local biodiversity loss. We argue that replicated landscape-scale studies are now needed that describe changes across a range of biodiversity groups (above and below ground) in relation to land-use and landscape context to address knowledge gaps and biases. Such descriptive studies need to be complemented by a deeper understanding of the causes of species turnover patterns, together with work on the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem function and services. Biodiversity conservation in the region is becoming increasingly embedded within a more multi-functional view of agriculture-forest mosaics that attempts to recognise and value the range of services provided by tree cover and other land-uses. This relatively new perspective has the potential, at least in principle, to re-shape the drivers of land-use change because tree cover can generate additional revenue through carbon trading or certification schemes. It will become clearer over the coming decades whether this potential can be realised, but the implications for biodiversity conservation in the region are potentially profound. The socio-economic processes that have driven forest loss and degradation in West Africa are having an increasing impact on the relatively undisturbed rainforest of the Congo Basin. We conclude by pointing out that while West African forest landscapes are a potent reminder of what might happen in Central Africa in the near future, they also provide insights for developing policies and practice that might avoid comparable levels of forest loss and degradation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010,"2019-06-28 18:10:15","2019-06-28T18:10:15Z",NA,"2341–2350","","10","143",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem services; Land-use change; Multi-functional landscapes; Tropical forest",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"S6CRMPHB","journalArticle",NA,"Zahabu, E; Malimbwi, R E; Ngaga, Y M","Payments for Environmental Services as Incentive Opportunities for Catchment Forest Reserves Management in Tanzania","","","","","","Catchment forests occupy a total of 2.8 million hectares in Tanzania. This is about 8% of the total forested land in Tanzania. While catchment forests offer both direct tangible benefits and indirect benefits of which some are perceived as environmental services, they are threatened by prevailing high rate of deforestation and general degradation. Traditionally the management of catchment forests focused on expanding the area under state tenure by excluding local communities. This approach has resulted in greater forest degradation as a result of increasing demand for forest products by local communities due to population increase and lack of alternative sources of income. Inadequate government resources in terms of manpower and funding to effectively manage catchments forests and other forests also contributed to the failure. This reason and others have led to the emergence of Participatory Forest Management (PFM) in its varying facets reflecting varying degrees of involvement of local communities in the management of forest resources. PFM has two main scenarios in Tanzania, Joint Forest Management (JFM) where by villagers and the government jointly manages the forest, and Community Based Forest Management (CBFM) whereby management of the forest is vested wholly in the hands of the local communities. JFM is adopted in catchment forests because of their sensitive nature. The total forest area which is under PFM or is in the process of changing is 2,975,919 ha of which 1,890,613 ha are under JFM. The last decade has witnessed an overwhelming popularity of PFM in most developing countries with varying levels of success. A well managed catchment forest normally benefits a wide range of stakeholders, normally far away from the forest in the form of water for domestic use, hydroelectricity, tourism and carbon sequestration among others. It is logical that these stakeholders should pay for the outcomes of good forest management as incentives to the managers, the local communities. In a study carried out with respect to catchment forest reserves in Tanga, Morogoro, Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions the actual Total Economic Value (TEV) of the forests was rated at USD 496 million per year. A fraction of this value should be ploughed back to the local communities as payment for environmental services. Various benefit sharing mechanisms have been explored in this paper as incentives for improved forest management.",NA,"2019-06-28 18:10:12","2019-06-28T18:10:12Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The steroid hormone profile in the adjacent surface water was also determined. Pro was the most abundant (41%, 408. ng/L) in the influent, followed by tes (35%, 343. ng/L) and E2 (12%, 119. ng/L). E1 was the most abundant (35%, 23. ng/L) in effluent, followed by E2 (30%, 20. ng/L) and tes (17%, 11. ng/L). Chemical removal efficiencies of the steroid hormones by the WWW averaged 92%. High removal efficiency was observed for pro (98%. ??. 2) and tes (96%. ??. 1), compared to natural (72-100%) and synthetic estrogen (90%. ??. 3), with biodegradation being the major removal route for pro and tes. The lowest removal for E2 is in spring (65%), and maximum removal is in winter (95%). Natural (E2, E1) and synthetic estrogen (EE2) were major contributors to influent (E2. =. 69%) and effluent (E2 = 73%) estrogenic potency. The estrogenic potency removal averaged 85% (range: 73-100). Risk assessment of the steroid hormones present in wastewater effluent, and surface water, indicated that EE2 and E2 pose the highest risk to human health and fish. EE2 was found to be much more resistant to biodegradation, compared to E2, in surface water. Estrone, as the breakdown product of E2 and EE2 in wastewater, appears to be suitable as an indicator of EDCs. The study suggests that a battery of tests: quantitative chemical assay, bioassay for estrogenic activity and risk assessment methods, collectively, are preferred in order to make meaningful, accurate conclusions regarding potential adverse effects of EDCs present in treated wastewater effluent or surface water, to the aquatic environment, human health, and wildlife systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:10:08","2019-06-28T18:10:08Z",NA,"584–597","","","468-469",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24056449",NA,NA,NA,"Activated sludge; ELISA; Endocrine disrupting compound (EDC); Risk assessment; Sewage effluent; Steroid hormones",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The highest Cd concentrations were found in the clay fractions in all three dams, with a range between 66.0 µg·g-1 and 107 µg·g-1 . Lead concentrations below 34 µg·g-1 were found in all six sediment types from Klerkskraal Dam, while Potchefstroom Dam had the highest lead levels (range: 34 - 62 µg·g- 1 ) for the six sediment fractions and also for all the fish tissue types (range: 38 - 79 µg·g-1 ). Lead alkyls from motorboat exhausts were probably responsible for the high lead concentrations in the sediment of Potchefstroom Dam and in the mudfish tissues. The mean zinc concentrations from five of the six fractions in Boskop Dam were significantly higher compared to the other dams, with a range between 25 µg·g-1 to 59 µg·g-1 . The combined six fractions were between five and 100 times lower in concentration when compared to the pelitic sediment samples from sediments at the Lebanon and West Driefontein mines in the Mooi River catchment. Copper concentrations in dam sediment from the six fractions for the three dams, ranging between 11µg·g-1 to 36 µg·g-1 , were higher when compared with copper levels worldwide. The kidneys, gills and liver had the highest levels of Cd, Pb and Cu respectively compared to other tissues from L. capensis, while the gills had the highest concentration of Zn. In conclusion, higher than normal metal concentrations were found in Boskop Dam sediments, which could be linked to gold mine operations inside the Mooi River catchment area. Lead, Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations in L. capensis tissues were much lower compared to reported data on South African fish, but on par with world levels. The percentage of uranium present in sediment samples (analysed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry) from the three dams was 9.0 % (SD 2.1%). In sediment it was found that cation exchange capacity measurements and the dolomitic hard water and high pH of the Mooi River water effectively ‘detoxified' Cd and Pb, forming insoluble complexation products buried in the sediment.",2004,"2019-06-28 18:10:07","2019-06-28T18:10:07Z",NA,"211–218","","2","30",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"CEC; Cd; Cu; Dam sediment; Fish tissues; Pb; Sediment profiles; Zn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extinction may be prevented by forging successful cooperation between consumers, initiating a joint harvesting process.

While species substitutability has been shown to reduce the value of diversity, we show that the flexibility associated with substitutability is a source of value. Marginal species value is decreasing in the number of species, but rising and convex in the value of the marginal species. As we show in the two-species homogenous model, increased volatility raises biodiversity value, and a positive correlation between species values both reduces the value of the pool of species and the value of biodiversity. The role played by the correlation between the value of a species and the value of other species, is reminiscent of the Beta of a financial asset.

The Grassland biome has experienced a significant increase in the cover of grasses and tall shrubs and a significant decline in cover of dwarf shrubs. Total cover and the cover of grasses have increased significantly in the Nama-karoo biome. We interpret these patterns as evidence for a south westwards shift in the Grassland/Nama-karoo biome boundary in the second half of the 20th century. Although there has been relatively little change in the boundaries between the Albany Thicket and adjacent biomes, several species with subtropical biogeographic affinities have increased in cover and abundance over this period in all biomes investigated.

But patterns of cover change can vary even within one given setting - understanding these complexities can offer insights into the effective maintenance of forest cover. Using satellite image analyses together with historical information, population census data and interviews with local informants, we analysed the drivers of forest cover change in three periods between 1973 and 2009 on Mt Elgon, Uganda. More than 25% of the forest cover of the Mt Elgon Forest Reserve/National Park was lost in 35. years. In periods when law enforcement was weaker, forest clearing was greatest in areas combining a dense population and people who had become relatively wealthy from coffee production. Once stronger law enforcement was re-established forest recovered in most places. Collaborative management agreements between communities and the park authorities were associated with better forest recovery, but deforestation continued in other areas with persistent conflicts about park boundaries. These conflicts were associated with profitability of annual crops and political interference. The interplay of factors originating at larger scales (government policy, market demand, political agendas and community engagement) resulted in a ""back-and-forth"" of clearing and regrowth. Our study reveals that the context (e.g. law enforcement, collaborative management, political interference) under which drivers such as population, wealth, market access and commodity prices operate, rather than the drivers per se, determines impacts on forest cover. Conservation and development interventions need to recognize and address local factors within the context and conditionalities generated by larger scale external influences. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:09:53","2019-06-28T18:09:53Z",NA,"257–268","","",159,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Coffee; Conservation management; Forest cover change; Local livelihoods; Mt Elgon; Protected areas",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Location World-wide; detailed case study in South Africa. Methods We define four components of invasion debt: the number of species not yet introduced but likely to be introduced in the future given current levels of introduction/propagule pressure; the establishment of introduced species; the potential increase in area invaded by established species (including invasive species); and the potential increase in impacts. We demonstrate the approach in terms of number of species for 21 known invasive Australian Acacia species globally and estimate three components of invasion debt for 58 Acacia species already introduced to South Africa by quantifying key invasion factors (environmental suitability, species invasion status, residence time, propagule pressure, spread rate and impacts). Results Current global patterns of invasive species richness reflect historical trends of introduction – most acacia species that will become invasive in southern Africa have already invaded, but there is a substantial establishment debt in South and North America. In South Africa, the likely consequence of invasion debt over the next 20 years was estimated at: four additional species becoming invasive with an average increase of 1075 km2 invaded area per invasive species. We estimate that this would require over US$ 500 million to clear. Main conclusions Our results indicate that invasion debt is a valuable metric for reporting on the threats attributable to biological invasions, that invasion debt must be factored into strategic plans for managing global change, and, as with other studies, they highlight the value of proactive management.

To date, a global-scale understanding of fire is largely limited to the annual extent of burning as detected by satellites. This is problematic becausefire ismultidimensional, and focus ona single metric belies its complexity and importance within the Earth system. To address this,weidentifiedfive key characteristics offire regimes— size, frequency, intensity, season, and extent—and combined new and existing global datasets to represent each. We assessed how these global fire regime characteristics are related to patterns of climate, vegetation (biomes), and human activity. Cross-correla- tions demonstrate that only certain combinations of fire character- istics are possible, reflecting fundamental constraints in the types of fire regimes that can exist. A Bayesian clustering algorithm iden- tified five global syndromes of fire regimes, or pyromes. Four pyromes represent distinctions between crown, litter, and grass- fueled fires, and the relationship of these to biomes and climate are not deterministic. Pyromes were partially discriminated on the basis of available moisture and rainfall seasonality. Human impacts also affected pyromes and are globally apparent as the driver of afifth and unique pyrome that represents human-engineered mod- ifications to fire characteristics.

Gaps in in situ data have so far prevented a full assessment of the response of Lake Chad to the ongoing prolonged drought that started in the second half of the 20th century. Like many other wetlands and shallow lakes, the 'Small' Lake Chad includes large areas of water under aquatic vegetation which needs to be accounted for to obtain the total inundated area. In this paper, a methodology is proposed that uses Meteosat thermal maximum composite data (Tmax) to account for water covered by aquatic vegetation and provide a consistent monthly time series of total inundated area estimates for Lake Chad. Total inundation patterns in Lake Chad were reconstructed for a 15-yr period (1986-2001) which includes the peak of the drought (86-91) and therefore provides new observations on the hydrological functioning of the 'Small' Lake Chad. During the study period, Lake Chad remained below 16,400km2 (third quartile ???8800km2). The variability of the inundated area observed in the northern pool (standard deviation ??northernpool=1980km2) is about 60% greater than that of the southern pool (??southernpool=1250km2). The same methodology could be applied to other large wetlands and shallow lakes in semi-arid or arid regions elsewehere using Meteosat (e.g. Niger Inland Delta, Sudd in Sudan, Okavango Delta) and other weather satellites (e.g., floodplains of the Lake Eyre Basin in Australia and Andean Altiplano Lakes in South America). ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:09:48","2019-06-28T18:09:48Z",NA,"87–98","","1-2",404,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Drought; Global change; Remote sensing; Water resources",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we analyse results from an attribution modelling system designed to examine how anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have contributed to weather and flood risk in our current climate. The system is based on comparison of real world climate and hydrological simulations with parallel counterfactual simulations of the climate and hydrological responses under conditions that might have been had human activities not emitted greenhouse gases. The analyses allow us to address the question of whether anthropogenic climate change contributed to increasing the risk of these high flood events in the Okavango system.Results show that the probability of occurrence of high floods during 2009-2011 in the current climate is likely lower than it would have been in a climate without anthropogenic greenhouse gases. This result is robust across the two climate models and various data processing procedures, although the exact figures for the associated decrease in risk differ. Results also differ between the three years examined, indicating that the ""time-slice"" method used here needs to be applied to multiple years in order to accurately estimate the contribution of emissions to current risk.

The main goal of this study was to analyze the ecosystem functions and services of Namatala wetland and their drivers of change, and to suggest directions for sustainable use. Data on climate, hydrology, water quality, population and land use were collected. Stakeholder workshops were organized at national and local levels to identify stakeholder interests in the wetland and conflicts. The institutional context for management of Namatala wetland was analyzed. A qualitative assessment of the ecosystem services was performed. All results were integrated into a DPSIR network showing the drivers of change, impact on ecosystem services and possible responses for management. Results show that the communities around Namatala wetland strongly depend on the wetland ecosystem for provisioning services. A spatial gradient in ecosystem services was observed. The upper, converted part of the wetland is more important for provisioning services while the lower, more intact wetland supports regulating and habitat ecosystem services. The institutional framework is complex due to the involvement of several ministries at the national level and several levels of decentralized, local government. Horizontal and vertical coordination of policy implementation is weak. There are diverging perceptions among stakeholders about the priority issues in wetland management. Resource users worry about water and land use conflicts, while local and national government agencies are more concerned about agricultural encroachment and biodiversity loss. There are also differences in interpretation of land ownership between the national wetland policy and local customary arrangements. For sustainable management of Namatala wetland, there is a need for more horizontal and vertical coordination in wetland policy implementation, application of sustainable agriculture and integrated water and nutrient management techniques, and continued monitoring, research and capacity building to support adaptive management. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:09:46","2019-06-28T18:09:46Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem services; Namatala wetland; Papyrus; Sustainable use of wetlands; Water quality; Wetland agriculture",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We assess the impacts on terrestrial biodiversity using the Biodiversity Intactness Index, which gives the average change in population size relative to the pre-modern state, across all terrestrial species of plants and vertebrates. Over the coming century, we project absolute declines in the average population sizes of these taxa that are two to three times greater than the reductions that have occurred since circa 1700. Our results highlight the immense challenges faced by efforts to reduce rates of biodiversity loss in southern Africa, even under relatively optimistic scenarios. These results stress the urgent need for better aligning biodiversity conservation and development priorities in the region.

Some species, often alien to Madagascar and introduced by humans, have expanded their range rapidly and have had both negative and positive effects on landscapes, on native biodiversity, and on livelihoods. Examples include the prickly pear ( raketa ), the silver wattle ( mimosa ), and, recently, the Asian common toad ( radaka boka ). Building on a conceptual approach to 'invasive species', this paper emphasizes the importance of inclusive and deliberative site- and population - specific management of invasive species. It analyses three separate concepts commonly used in definitions of invasion: the origin, behaviour, and effects of particular species. It places these concepts in their broader social and ecological context, with particular attention to local perspectives on invasive species. We illustrate these concepts with Malagasy examples and data. The examples demonstrate that while invasions can have dramatic consequences, there can be multiple, often competing, interests as well as site - specific biophysical, environmental, and cultural considerations that need to be taken into account when designing policy and management interventions. We conclude with a number of lessons learned. RÉSUMÉ Contrairement à la plupart des autres îles, et en dépit du quali­ficatif ‘invasif' rattaché depuis longtemps à certaines espèces qui s'y sont naturalisées, les réflexions autour de l'approche des espèces invasives à Madagascar demeurent récentes. L'opuntia ( Opuntia spp.) figure certes parmi les plus anciens exemples d'espèces traités dans la littérature sur les invasions biologiques. Mais ce n'est vraiment qu'avec le retentissement médiatique autour de la détection en 2011 de la présence du crapaud masqué ( Duttaphrynus melanostictus ) et la recherche d'une parade appropriée que s'est affirmée la nécessité de traiter cette question des espèces invasives en tant que telle. Une posture nativiste et uniforme qui ignorerait la spécificité des contextes biophysiques et socio - économiques locaux, mais aussi la pluralité des formes d'invasion biologique et des définitions qui s'y rattachent, ne saurait être privilégiée. L'article montre qu'il s'agit de situer les réflexions dans un contexte insulaire socio - économique dans lequel les espèces allogènes tiennent depuis longtemps une large place. Il défend en outre la nécessité d'envisager les espèces invasives non pas selon une forme de perception unique et autoritariste, mais selon une diversité de points de vue, conforme aux conflits d'intérêts qui se manifestent parfois, et mettant plutôt en avant le caractère exogène des espèces invasives, leurs effets (négatifs, mais aussi positifs) sur le milieu, ou leur mode de fonctionnement (dispersion, dominance) dans des contextes spécifiques et locaux. Il convient en particulier d'observer qu'aux coûts générés par les invasions biologiques peuvent s'ajouter des bénéfices économiques, et que les impacts écologiques néfastes peuvent se combiner avec des incidences heureuses, y compris auprès d'espèces indigènes en situation critique. En outre, le point de vue des populations humaines, leur connaissance d'espèces invasives quotidiennement rencontrées, leur réticence à scinder le vivant en espèces indigènes et allogène, mais aussi leur vision pragmatique, ne sauraient être mésestimés, et moins encore oubliés. Enfin, l'article invite à prendre du recul face aux effets rhétoriques liés aux discours conventionnels sur les invasions biologiques, à éviter les amalgames et les généralisations excessives, à tenir compte des contraintes environnementales mais aussi des aspirations socio - économiques des populations locales, et à prendre en compte la diversité des spécificités locales, qu'elles soient biophysiques ou sociales. En conclusion, il est sans doute heureux que Madagascar n'ait rejoint que très récemment la mouvance internationale des réflexions sur les espèces invasives : cela lui permet en effet d'être en mesure de disposer d'une position équilibrée, déjouant certains discours catastrophistes, et préférant une approche résolument contextualisée, à l'échelle nationale comme aux échelles régionales.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:09:42","2019-06-28T18:09:42Z",NA,"60–70","","2",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Interest in the preservation of these habitats in Europe has increased over the last decades, but over this time there has been a general decline in habitat quality, affecting community structure, ecosystem functions and biodiversity. Negative drivers that trigger these changes include land-use changes (i.e. habitat destruction and fragmentation), pollution, climate change, natural succession and human management, as well as the presence of invasive exotic species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSCOPE: Based on recent scientific literature, the effect of each of these potential drivers on a wide set of factors, including physiological traits, species richness and diversity, community structure, ecosystem functions and soil conditions, is reviewed. The effects of these drivers are generally understood, but the direction and magnitude of factor interactions, whenever studied, have shown high variability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Habitat loss and fragmentation affect sensitive species and ecosystem functions. The nature of the surrounding area will condition the quality of the heathland remnants by, for example, propagule pressure from invasive species. The dominant ericoid shrubs can be out-competed by vigorous perennial grasses with increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition, although interactions with climate and management practices may either counteract or enhance this process. Grazing or periodic burning promotes heath loss but site-specific combined treatments maintain species diversity and community structure. Climate change alone moderately affects plant diversity, community structure and ecosystem functions. Combined with other factors, climatic changes will condition heath development, mainly with regard to key aspects such as seed set and seedling establishment, rare species occurrence and nutrient cycling in the soil. It is essential to address the effects of not only individual factors, but their interactions, together with land-use history, on heathland development and conservation in order to predict habitat response to future scenarios.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:09:35","2019-06-28T18:09:35Z",NA,"151–172","","2",111,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23223202",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Biological invasions; Burning; Climate change; Environmental interactions; Europe; Fynbos; Grazing; Heathlands; Land-use change; Natural succession; Pollution",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been suggested that low CO2 contributed to reduced tree cover in savanna and grassland biomes at LGM, and that increasing CO2 over the last century promoted increases in woody plants in these ecosystems over the past few decades. Despite the implications of this idea for understanding global carbon cycle dynamics and key global role of the savanna biome, there are still very few experimental studies quantifying the effects of CO2 on tree growth and demography in savannas and grasslands. In this paper we present photosynthetic, growth and carbon allocation responses of African savanna trees (Acacia karroo and Acacia nilotica) and a C-4 grass, Themeda triandra, exposed to a gradient of CO2 concentrations from 180 (typical of LGM) to 1000 mu mol mol-1 in open-top chambers in a glasshouse as a first empirical test of this idea. Photosynthesis, total stem length, total stem diameter, shoot dry weight and root dry weight of the acacias increased significantly across the CO2 gradient, saturating at higher CO2 concentrations. After clipping to simulate fire, plants showed an even greater response in total stem length, total stem diameter and shoot dry weight, signalling the importance of re-sprouting following disturbances such as fire or herbivory in savanna systems. Root starch (per unit root mass and total root starch per plant) increased steeply along the CO2 gradient, explaining the re-sprouting response. In contrast to the strong response of tree seedlings to the CO2 gradient, grass productivity showed little variation, even at low CO2 concentrations. These results suggest that CO2 has significant direct effects on tree recruitment in grassy ecosystems, influencing the ability of trees to recover from fire damage and herbivory. Fire and herbivore regimes that were effective in controlling tree increases in grassy ecosystems could thus be much less effective in a CO2-rich world, but field-based tests are needed to confirm this suggestion",2010,"2019-06-28 18:09:33","2019-06-28T18:09:33Z",NA,"451–463","","4",35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Elevated CO2; Fire; Last glacial maximum; Root; Savanna; Starch",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The paper specifically addresses the questions on how local farmers read and predict the weather; and how they can collaborate with weather scientists in devising adaptation strategies for climate variability (CV) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Recent trends in agriculture-related weather variables available from country's climate services, as well as in freely available satellite rainfall products were analysed. The utility of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system for the study area in the context of supporting farmer's information needs were assessed. Through a multi-stage sampling procedure, a total of 592 households heads in 8 rural communities in the Okavango Delta were selected and interviewed using open and close-ended interview schedules. Also, 19 scientists were purposively selected and interviewed using questionnaires. Key informant interviews, focus group and knowledge validation workshops were used to generate qualitative information from both farmers and scientists. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in summarising the data. Analysis of satellite rainfall products indicated that there was a consistent increase in total annual rainfall throughout the region in the last 10. years, accompanied by an increase in number of rain days, and reduction of duration of dry spells. However, there is a progressive increase in the region's temperatures leading to increase in potential evaporation. Findings from social surveys show that farmers' age, education level, number of years engaged in farming, sources of weather information, knowledge of weather forecasting and decision on farming practices either had a significant relationship or correlation with their perceptions about the nature of both local [ethno-meteorological] and scientific weather knowledge. Nonetheless, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of farmers in relation to their perceptions and those of the climate scientists about the nature of both local and Western knowledge. As farmers are adept at judging seasonal patterns through long-standing ethno-meteorology, one major CV adaptation measure is their ability to anticipate changes in future weather conditions, which enables them to adjust their farming calendars and make decisions on crop type selection in any given season.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:09:33","2019-06-28T18:09:33Z",NA,"43–58","","",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate variability; Ethno-meteorology; Hydrology; Science; Small farmers; Weather forecast",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To investigate the influence of large-scale circulation on local-scale precipitation, a full spatial–statistical description of precipitation occurrence and amount for Senegal is developed. These regression-type models have been built on the basis of daily records at 137 locations and were developed in two stages: (i) a baseline model describing the expected daily occurrence probability and precipitation amount as spatial fields from monsoon onset to offset, and (ii) the inclusion of weather types defined from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis 850-hPa winds and 925-hPa relative humidity es- tablishing the link to the synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation. During peak phase, the resulting types appear in two main cycles that can be linked to passing African easterly waves. The models allow the in- vestigation of the spatial response of precipitation occurrence and amount to a discrete set of preferred states of the atmospheric circulation. As such, they can be used for drought risk mapping and the downscaling of climate change projections. Necessary choices, such as filtering and scaling of the atmospheric data (as well as the number of weather types to be used), have been made on the basis of the precipitation models' performance instead of relying on external criteria. It could be demonstrated that the inclusion of the synoptic-scale weather types lead to skill on the local and daily scale. On the interannual scale, the models for precipitation occurrence and amount capture 26% and 38% of the interannual spatially averaged variability, corresponding to Pearson correlation coefficients of rO 5 0.52 and ri 5 0.65, respectively.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:09:33","2019-06-28T18:09:33Z",NA,"8189–8209","","20",26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We note that savanna tree biomass is strongly constrained by disturbance, particularly fire, and that elevated CO2 could act to reduce this constraint. Our argument combines knowledge of tree recovery from injury after grassland fires, with theory about carbon acquisition and carbohydrate storage patterns in C3 woody plants in response to elevated CO2. We propose simply that elevated CO2 will tend to favour regrowth of juvenile trees trapped (sometimes for decades) in the 'topkill' zone, thus allowing them to escape more readily from periodic fires as CO2 continues to rise.

The recent emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases appears to be driven by globalization and ecological disruption. We propose that habitat destruction and biodiversity loss associated with biotic homogenization can increase the incidence and distribution of infectious diseases affecting humans. The clearest connection between biotic homogenization and infectious disease is the spread of nonindigenous vectors and pathogens. The loss of predators and hosts that dilute pathogen transmission can also increase the incidence of vectorborne illnesses. Other mechanisms include enhanced abiotic conditions for pathogens and vectors and higher host-pathogen encounter rates.

There is a lack of clarity on how climate change impacts on drought are best quantified from an agricultural perspective, with different metrics giving very different impressions of future risk. The dependence of some regional agriculture on remote rainfall, snowmelt and glaciers adds to the complexity. Indirect impacts via sea-level rise, storms and diseases have not been quantified.

RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted either through exposure to infected animals or through bites from different species of infected mosquitoes, mainly of Aedes and Culex genera. These mosquitoes are very sensitive to environmental conditions, which may determine their presence, biology, and abundance. In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are known to be closely associated with heavy rainfall events, unlike in the semi-arid regions of West Africa where the drivers of RVF emergence remain poorly understood. The assumed importance of temporary ponds and rainfall temporal distribution therefore needs to be investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A hydrological model is combined with a mosquito population model to predict the abundance of the two main mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes) involved in RVFV transmission in Senegal. The study area is an agropastoral zone located in the Ferlo Valley, characterized by a dense network of temporary water ponds which constitute mosquito breeding sites. The hydrological model uses daily rainfall as input to simulate variations of pond surface areas. The mosquito population model is mechanistic, considers both aquatic and adult stages and is driven by pond dynamics. Once validated using hydrological and entomological field data, the model was used to simulate the abundance dynamics of the two mosquito species over a 43-year period (1961-2003). We analysed the predicted dynamics of mosquito populations with regards to the years of main outbreaks. The results showed that the main RVF outbreaks occurred during years with simultaneous high abundances of both species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides for the first time a mechanistic insight on RVFV transmission in West Africa. It highlights the complementary roles of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes in virus transmission, and recommends the identification of rainfall patterns favourable for RVFV amplification.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:09:18","2019-06-28T18:09:18Z",NA,"","","8",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22928055",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years.

In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors.

Examples from existing take-back systems (mandatory and voluntary) such as take back of consumer electronics in the Netherlands, take back of information technology equipment and packaging in Germany and company initiated take back systems are included in this paper.

With help of Environmental Value Chain Analysis, valuable lessons can be learned how to improve take-back and end-of-life systems. These examples also demonstrate how future take-back systems, regulated or voluntary, can benefit from previous experience. Some benefits are in the fields of: · Improving lines of communication with parties involved (in particular, producers and consumers) · Examining where financial burden is really being placed (fees passed to consumer, municipal waste, or producers) · Structuring take back in such a way that ecodesign and design for end-of-life are fostered",NA,"2019-06-28 18:09:08","2019-06-28T18:09:08Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"End-of-life; ecodesign strategy; take back systems",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"3DF67WUB","journalArticle",2010,"","Africa's Water Quality","","","","","","Africa's Water Quality: A Chemical Science Perspective is a unique report summarising the conclusions and recommendations emerging from the Pan Africa Chemistry Network Sustainable Water Conference 2009. It represents the opinions and knowledge from some of Africa's best scientists and practitioners, from 14 countries in Africa, in the field of sustainable water research and development. The recommendations presented in the report specify 'fit for purpose' solutions for water wherever it is used: for drinking, for growing food, and to satisfy domestic and industrial needs. The chemical sciences will be crucial, in particular through centres for analytical chemistry for the evaluation and monitoring of water quality. The vital role that Africa's scientists must play in meeting water quality challenges cannot be overestimated. These challenges present the opportunity for genuine partnership and collaborations between scientific communities and governments, both across the African states and internationally. The ultimate goal of the report is to raise the profile of water quality in policy agenda, so that water quality is always considered alongside water quantity. To access a full version of the report, visit the Royal Society of Chemistry website. www.rsc.org/AfricasWaterQuality Key messages and recommendations from the report 1. Scientists working within Africa have the knowledge, expertise and potential to help formulate and implement sustainable water strategies. African scientists need to be given a platform to work more closely with African Governments to ensure that a culture of science-based water management is established. 2. Increasing Africa's capacity in analytical chemistry is imperative in order to support chemical monitoring and water management activities. The creation of 'Centres of Excellence' will be essential to achieve a critical mass of scientifically qualified and technically trained personnel. These centres should also facilitate scientific networking activities both intra-Africa and internationally. 3. Improving water quality is a vital requirement for better public health, productivity and economic prosperity. This must be addressed through innovative water management and water treatment technologies that are appropriate for local needs, coupled with adequate monitoring systems. 4. Food production accounts for a large proportion of total water use. The conversion rates of water to food in Africa are amongst the lowest in the world. Efficiency of water use as well as land productivity must be improved whilst maintaining a sufficient source of good quality water for other purposes. 5. Governments must be responsible and accountable for providing sustainable water strategies and a framework to provide clean drinking water, sanitation services, and food. Water data should be shared across jurisdictions and new institutions, regulatory bodies and organisations should be established where appropriate to ensure efficient water management.

However, the current static system is at risk from the effects of global environmental change. This is especially true in Africa, a biodiversity-rich continent expected to be hit hard by climate change. Focusing on African protected areas that experience limited human impact (International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories I and II), we tested three hypotheses regarding the impact of climate change on the dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP). We expected a lower annual NPP and higher seasonality in NPP in Eastern and Southern Africa; changes in NPP dynamics to coincide with changes in precipitation; no correlation between changes in NPP dynamics and human development. To test these expectations, we used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an index of NPP. Results show that, between 1982 and 2008, an increased vegetation greenness was observed in 27% of the protected areas monitored (mostly in Western Africa), and an increased seasonality in 9% of them (mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa). Our results lend support to current expectations regarding the impacts of climate change, and demonstrate how protected areas of IUCN categories I and II could be used to track the effect of climate change on ecosystem functioning in Africa, and possibly elsewhere. The study highlights the need for a dynamic approach to conservation, where the relevance and efficiency of management actions need to be regularly evaluated. It also demonstrates that satellite-based approaches offer a cheap, verifiable way to quickly identify protected areas of concern at a global scale, supporting managers in their effort to design and apply adaptive management strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:09:03","2019-06-28T18:09:03Z",NA,"269–276","","","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; NDVI; National park; Primary productivity; Remote sensing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study evaluates different land management scenarios in terms of ecosystem services in a South African rangeland, the Baviaanskloof catchment. As measured data were limited, we used simple models to quantify and map the effect of the different combination of agricultural, nature conservation and restoration practices on multiple ecosystem services. The land management scenarios were evaluated against management targets set for individual ecosystem services. Results highlight how the provision of ecosystem services is related to land management as unmanaged, pristine ecosystems provide a different mix of ecosystem services than ecosystems recently restored or managed as grazing lands. Results also indicate that historically overgrazed lands provide no forage, may retain 40% less sediment and have 38% lower biodiversity, while providing 60% more fuel wood and supplying two and half times more water (i.e. retaining less water), than pristine or restored lands. We conclude that a combination of light grazing, low input agriculture, nature conservation and restoration is the best for the sufficient provision of multiple ecosystem services. Applying such mixed management would improve biodiversity, ecotourism and maintain forage production and regulating services on farmers' land. This management option also fits into and further optimizes local decision-makers' vision regarding the future management of the area. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:09:02","2019-06-28T18:09:02Z",NA,"692–703","","","45",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem degradation; Environmental decision-making; GIS; Mapping; Scenario; Thicket restoration",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The four land uses were: natural grassland; woodland, inside and outside protected area; maize mono-cropping and maize-bean intercropping systems in adjacent agricultural farms. Sampling of soil macro-fauna was carried out in November, 2009 (short rain), April 2010 (wet rainy season) and September 2010 (dry season). Hand sorting of soil taken from 25 × 25 × 30 cm monoliths was used to extract all soil macro fauna greater than 2 mm body length. A total of 3,658 individuals comprising of 128 species mainly belonging to Phylum Arthropoda distributed across 3 classes and 13 orders, and Phylum Annelida with one order were collected across the four different land use systems. Termites and ants, and to a lesser extent coleopteran and earthworms were the most abundant groups. Significant effects of land use on macro-fauna abundance and species richness in all cases (p\textless0.001) were observed. There were significant interaction between Season*Region*Land use (p\textless0.01), Region*Land use (p\textless0.05) and Region*Protection*Land use (p\textless0.02). Grassland and woodland had the highest density (1351.61 vs. 2852.47 individual m-2) of total macro-fauna, whilst the lowest density occurred in agricultural land (205.48 individual m-2). Agriculture altered macro-fauna communities by declining individuals from Order Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and isoptera by \textgreater 50% and eliminating some Orders/Species. Human related disturbances outside protected area network declined macro-fauna density in grassland and woodland in dry region (65.07 vs. 39.74%) but increased the density by 107 vs. 340% in wet region.

Although these policies often have a stated aim of producing a â€ø enet gainâ€ or â€ø eno net lossâ€ in environmental benefits, it is challenging to determine the potential impacts of a policy and if, or when, it will achieve its objectives. In this paper we address these questions with a general approach that uses predictive modelling under uncertainty to quantify the ecological impacts of different offset policies. This is demonstrated with a case study to the west of Melbourne, Australia where a proposed expansion of Melbourneâ€™s urban growth boundary would result in a loss of endangered native grassland, requiring offsets to be implemented as compensation. Three different offset policies were modelled: i) no restrictions on offset location, ii) offset locations spatially restricted to a strategically defined area and iii) offset locations spatially and temporally restricted, requiring all offsets to be implemented before commencing development. The ecological impact of the policies was determined with a system model that predicts future changes in the extent and condition of native grassland. The case study demonstrates how relative and absolute policy performance can be quantified in relation to best and worst-case scenarios. The study also shows that the ecological benefits of being temporally and spatially strategic in choosing offsets locations are substantially greater than being spatially strategic alone. We also show that even with considerable uncertainties in the system model predicting future grassland condition, the performance of the three offset policies can still be differentiated. Finally, we show the extent to which a policy achieves a â€ø enet gainâ€ is dependent on the baseline against which policy performance is measured. The quantitative framework presented here can also be used to evaluate other offset policies or extended to deal with different types of environmental policies.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:08:58","2019-06-28T18:08:58Z",NA,"1481–1488","","12","26",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity offsets; Conservation planning; Global sensitivity analysis; Grassland; Habitat quality; Policy modelling; Uncertainty",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The international conservation and development community has committed to implementing plans for sustainable use of natural resources and has requested development of monitoring systems of bushmeat offtake and trade. Although offtake monitoring systems and indicators for marine species are more developed, information on harvesting terrestrial species is limited. Building on approaches developed to monitor exploitation of fisheries and population trends, we have proposed two novel indicators for harvested terrestrial species: the mean body mass indicator (MBMI) assessing whether hunters are relying increasingly on smaller species over time, as a measure of defaunation, by tracking body mass composition of harvested species within samples across various sites and dates; and the offtake pressure indicator (OPI) as a measure of harvesting pressure on groups of wild animals within a region by combining multiple time series of the number of harvested individuals across species. We applied these two indicators to recently compiled data for West and Central African mammals and birds. Our exploratory analyses show that the MBMI of harvested mammals decreased but that of birds rose between 1966/1975 and 2010. For both mammals and birds the OPI increased substantially during the observed time period. Given our results, time-series data and information collated from multiple sources are useful to investigate trends in body mass of hunted species and offtake volumes. In the absence of comprehensive monitoring systems, we suggest that the two indicators developed in our study are adequate proxies of wildlife offtake, which together with additional data can inform conservation policies and actions at regional and global scales.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:08:55","2019-06-28T18:08:55Z",NA,"","","3","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Bushmeat; Exploitation; Harvest; Indicator",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is much speculation today that urban economies in sub-Saharan Africa are greatly improving and that the region may be on the brink of an upsurge in economic development. However, in terms of a broad, multi-dimensional, understanding of the term 'development', into which social justice must be factored, there are real concerns about whether the undoubted improvements in GDP growth in many countries are strongly connected to urban-located investment and job growth. Many African countries remain poorly placed, in terms of global comparative advantage, to attract significant foreign investment except in primary sectors. The extreme inequality in the ways in which the benefits of current growth are being shared in many countries is another huge problem for the creation of urban employment growth. This paper relates these issues to evidence about levels of economic (in)security in many African cities, and to how these have been reflected in a slowing in the rate of urbanization in many countries. It also reviews the evidence about the distribution of incomes in sub-Saharan Africa, and argues that the development of middle classes with their associated higher consumption patterns, is minimal as yet. Finally it reflects on the links, both current and prospective, between internal economic stimuli from, for example, natural-resource based activities including mining and agriculture, and African urban economic development and growth.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:08:51","2019-06-28T18:08:51Z",NA,"1–30","","","Paper#57",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is partly caused by insufficient knowledge about the economic and ecological value of mangrove ecosystems, which provide important ecosystem services, such as fish, flood prevention, erosion prevention, water regulation, and timber products. A strategy to improve mangrove ecosystem management would be to improve public understanding of the ecosystem's values. We studied these drivers on a regional scale, using socio-economic and grey literature and consultations with experts, thereby focusing on the period from 1980 to 2006. Wood harvesting, conversion of mangroves for agriculture, and bio-fuel plantations were important drivers of mangrove forest change. Coastal development is the most important direct driver of mangrove forest change, especially between 2000 and 2006, a period that coincides with large oil discoveries in the region. About 60% of all industries within the region are located near the coast, which is expected to attract about 50 million people by 2025. Future policies should target the risks of declining mangrove ecosystems in West-Central Africa. This requires focusing on adaptive strategies, reviewing existing coastal and marine ecosystem policies, and developing an integrated coastal management strategy for the region. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:08:50","2019-06-28T18:08:50Z",NA,"217–230","","November","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"West-Central Africa; drivers of mangrove forest change; ecosystem services; mangroves; sustainability",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The declining wildlife population in the recent time is as a result of a combination of factors, namely, increased access and demand for wildlife resources by rural and urban dwellers, population growth, improved hunting technology and lack of protein alternatives in many households.. This paper investigates the contribution of bush meat extraction to household's livelihood (income, health, nutrition, etc); the role of beliefs and taboos in wildlife conservation and the attitude of community members towards wildlife hunting and conservation in Oban Hills, Nigeria. Data for the study were generated through a triangulation of qualitative and quantitative methods using primary and secondary sources. It was revealed that majority of the people of Oban Hills are farmers although some also engaged in quarry business, civil service, trading, lumbering and hunting. However, there has been a decline in income generated from hunting and dependence on bush meat as protein source due to restrictions on hunting in and around forests in the protected area. It was also observed that beliefs and taboos in form of totems played a major role in wildlife conservation in the past; therefore involving existing cultural institutions in conservation efforts will facilitate sustainable wildlife exploitation in Oban Hills. However, the involvement of the cultural institution in the conservation agenda and the integration of these values into the overall conservation strategy will be achieved through a formal process of recognition and consultation by the responsible government agencies.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:08:37","2019-06-28T18:08:37Z",NA,"49–64","","1","38",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation; Extraction; Livelihood; Nigeria; Sustainability; Taboos; Wildlife",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analyzed nutrient concentrations in the desertified and non-degraded benchmark. For the desertified landscapes we analyzed nutrient concentrations at the coarse (landscape), medium (micro-landscape) and sampling unit (fine scale) levels. Further, for the desertified micro-landscapes, we used the differences in total nutrient concentrations to identify moderately dysfunctional and dysfunctional micro-landscapes. The desertified micro-landscapes had an overall lower soil organic matter, total nitrogen and exchangeable phosphorus, and soil water, but had elevated cation exchange capacity and soluble bases compared with the benchmark. Different intensities of desertification processes, mediated by the three proximate desertification drivers, produced varied amounts of nutrients corresponding with moderately dysfunctional and dysfunctional micro-landscapes. The dysfunctional micro-landscapes had the lowest nutrient availability. The effects of proximate desertification drivers on pooled nutrients were scale-independent. For individual nutrients only pH, soil water and Mg ++ showed scaling effects at the coarse or medium scales for soil erosion, while for grazing pressure pH, soil water, CEC, Na +, Mg 2++ and Ca 2++ showed scale dependence. The scaling effects were interlinked with landscape processes that operated simultaneously and interactively with different drivers. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The term includes changes in climate and climate variability, atmospheric composition, land use and land cover including deforestation and urbanisation, bio-geochemistry, globalisation of trade and transport, the spread of alien species, human health and technology. A subset of land use issues relates to the management of protective technologies in relation to residues in food and the environment and the emergence of resistance. Another is the question of changing biodiversity of both parasites and their associated natural enemies, and the effects on the host-parasite relationship and on parasite management. A framework for studying impacts of global change is proposed and illustrated with field data, and CLIMEX and simulation modelling of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus in Australia. Parasitology suffers from the perception that the key impacts of global change will be driven by changes at lower trophic levels, with parasitic interactions being treated as secondary effects. This is incorrect because the environment mediates host-parasite interactions as much as it affects parasites directly. Parasitologists need to strive for holistic solutions to the management of animal and human health, within a wider context of overall management of those systems, if they are to make a meaningful contribution to global efforts aimed at coping with global change. ?? 2001 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.",2001,"2019-06-28 18:08:32","2019-06-28T18:08:32Z",NA,"933–948","","9","31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 11406142",NA,NA,NA,"Boophilus microplus; CLIMEX; Climatic change; DYMEX; Land use; Modular modelling; Parasite; Pesticide resistance; Quarantine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The article describes a market mechanism for simultaneously internalizing the social cost of eliminating especially scarce habitat, and the social benefits of protecting or producing it. For landowners with low value non-habitat land uses, the market mechanism transforms habitat from a major liability into a money-making asset. For landowners with high value non-habitat uses, the market mechanism would be a very attractive alternative to the current slow and expensive case-by-case consultation process.

This study used regression tree and random forest analysis on global data for various climatic and human variables to establish their relative importance. The main interactions found at the global scale also apply regionally: greatest wildfire burned area is associated with high temperature (\textgreater 28 ??C), intermediate annual rainfall (350-1100. mm), and prolonged dry periods (which varies by region). However, the regions of highest fire incidence do not show clear and systematic behaviour. Thresholds seen in the regression tree split conditions vary, as do the interplay between climatic and anthropogenic variables, so challenges remain in developing robust predictive insight for the most wildfire-threatened regions.Anthropogenic activities alter the spatial extent of wildfires. Gross domestic product (GDP) density is the most important human predictor variable at the regional scale, and burned area is always greater when GDP density is minimised.

Predation can influence herbivore behaviour and demography, but how changes in predation and population structure affect herbivore distribution across abiotic gradients remains little known. We assessed whether predators altered the response of different age and sex classes of a dominant ungulate herbivore to changing abiotic conditions. Results: Elk (Cervus elaphus) presence declined with increasing snowpack, particularly in late winter when their body condition had deteriorated. Females and juveniles exhibited strong but constant negative responses to snowpack throughout the winter, although their mean occurrence declined over time likely due to sex-biased movement to lower elevations. Mature male occurrence responded only very slightly to snowpack and in a temporally invariant manner. Neither temporal nor spatial variation in wolf (Canis lupus) occurrence affected elk occurrence or elk responses to snowpack. Conclusions: Climate change impacts on herbivore distribution in this system are driven by spatially and temporally dynamic interactions between winter conditions and population structure, but the influence of predation risk appears weak.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:08:08","2019-06-28T18:08:08Z",NA,"4","","1","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Herbivory; Population structure; Predation risk; Species interactions; Yellowstone; climate change; herbivory; population structure; predation risk; species interactions; yellowstone",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The climate change phenomenon is a global concern, which typically threatens the sustainability of the livelihoods of the majority of the population living in the developing countries. Africa, particularly the sub-Saharan region, is likely to be negatively impacted by climate variability and change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Africas vulnerability arises from a combination of many factors, including extreme poverty, a high rate of population increase, frequent natural disasters such as droughts and fl oods, and agricultural systems (both crop and livestock production) that depend heavily on rainfall. Extreme natural occurrences such as fl oods and droughts are becoming increasingly frequent and severe.

It is a problem that cannot be solved alone by the efforts of a single country, but it requires a substantial amount of efforts from both countries and international organizations to successfully mitigate and eliminate overfishing. How can fisheries promote flourishing and sustainable development in inadequate institutions, and how is it possible to know that fishing activities are just and fair or basic human rights being violated? What are the consequences of overfishing, and who are held responsible? In this thesis, the fisheries partnership agreements between the European Union and Senegal are the main focus. The theoretical frameworks of ethics and justice, human rights, utilitarianism and responsibilities will be used to analyze the case of fisheries partnership agreements between the European Union and Senegal. Other West African countries will also be taken into consideration. IUU fishing activities, bycatch and discards are also problems related to overfishing. These are some of the variables that will be put under investigation. The case of fisheries agreement between the European Union and Senegal is one of many examples where developed countries may have taken advantage of developing countries with weak governance through fisheries agreement. Excessive and irresponsible fishing activities have led to overfished waters, which in turn may negatively influence poor fishing communities. Institutions are inadequate to prevent people from harm, and basic human rights may have been violated, which result in pain and misery.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:08:00","2019-06-28T18:08:00Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PhD Thesis",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, an alterna- tivemodel suggests thatmany invasive plants are better described as passengers of altered disturbance regimes or other changes in ecosystemproperties. Some species do seem to be easily categorized as passengers or drivers, but others may be better described as ‘‘back- seat drivers”. Back-seat drivers require or benefit from disruptions of ecosystem processes or properties that lead to declines of native species but also contribute to changes in ecosystemproperties and further declines of native species. Among these possibilities, drivers are a direct cause of the decline of native species through the introduction of novel traits or functions to an ecosys- tem, whereas back-seat drivers interact with ecosystem change to cause native species declines. Passengers are better considered as a symptom of an underlying problem, rather than the cause of native species declines.Driver, back-seat driver and passengermodels suggest different associations between invasive species, ecosystem change and native species declines, and these models provide a framework for predicting and understanding the response of native species to invasive species management.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:07:55","2019-06-28T18:07:55Z",NA,"1295–1304","","7","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Competition; Disturbance; Ecosystem change; Exotic species; Extinction",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we proposed a methodological framework to assess the potential impacts of current and future urbanization on high diversity sites and their associated species across the entire French Mediterranean region. Using a 100&#xa0;m grid cell, we adapted a land-use change (LUC) model to project future urbanization over a 20 years period. We developed a multi-level approach based on three impacts of urban development: the direct consumption of high diversity sites, the indirect urban effects on the surrounding area over a scale of 2&#xa0;km and a scale of 50&#xa0;km. Our model predicts that 35% of the total number of sites can potentially be impacted by urbanization (i.e. at least 1&#xa0;ha predicted to be built between 2006 and 2030). 3.2% of the total number of sites may lose 10% or more of their surface area to urbanization. We found that the impacts of urban area and urban growth differ among the three different pressure indicators in terms of surface area and localization of sites, number and nature of species impacted and variation of these patterns between the two dates.

The pesticides in air in Senga Bay on the southwest shore of Lake Malawi were not extensively weathered, implying recent use. Elevated levels of heptachlor, chlorobenzenes, aldrin, and dieldrin were detected periodically, which indicated use on a regular basis. Annual average concentrations for those pesticides ranged from 31 to 257 pg/m3. Levels of HCHs, DDTs, chlordanes, and R-endosufan in air at Senga Bay were comparable to those of the Laurentian Great Lakes, ranging from 24 to 40 pg/m3. Considering air-water gas exchange and wet deposition, the net fluxes of chlorinated pesticides to the lake surface were depositional. Concentrations of chlorinated pesticides in the water from Lake Malawi were relatively low compared to the Laurentian Great Lakes and Lake Baikal. This indicates rapid transformation of chemicals in the water column, which was further supported by high metabolite-to-parent ratios.

One hypothesis attributes this to sex differences in dispersal and in the variance of reproductive success. We tested this hypothesis by examining the coalescent dates of genetic markers within elephantid lineages, predicting that lower dispersal and lower variance in reproductive success among females would have increased mtDNA relative to nuclear coalescent dates. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two forest elephants, aligning them to mitogenomes of African savanna and Asian elephants, and of woolly mammoths, including the most divergent mitogenomes within each lineage. Using fossil calibrations, the divergence between African elephant F and S clade mitochondrial genomes (originating in forest and savanna elephant lineages, respectively) was estimated as 5.5 Ma. We estimated that the (African) ancestor of the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages diverged 6.0 Ma, indicating that four elephantid lineages had differentiated in Africa by the Miocene-Pliocene transition, concurrent with drier climates. The coalescent date for forest elephant mtDNAs was c. 2.4 Ma, suggesting that the decrease in tropical forest cover during the Pleistocene isolated distinct African forest elephant lineages. For all elephantid lineages, the ratio of mtDNA to nuclear coalescent dates was much greater than 0.25. This is consistent with the expectation that sex differences in dispersal and in variance of reproductive success would have increased the effective population size of mtDNA relative to nuclear markers in elephantids, contributing to the persistence of incongruent mtDNA phylogeographic patterns.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:07:37","2019-06-28T18:07:37Z",NA,"1175–1189","","5",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22260276",NA,NA,NA,"Asian elephant; Proboscidea; coalescent; molecular clock; savanna elephant; woolly mammoth",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These pressures modify groundwater levels and their temporal patterns and threaten vital ecosystem services such as arable land irrigation and ecosystem water requirements, especially during droughts. This review examines climate change effects on groundwater and dependent ecosystems. The mechanisms affecting natural variability in the global climate and the consequences of climate and land use changes due to anthropogenic influences are summarised based on studies from different hydrogeological strata and climate zones. The impacts on ecosystems are discussed based on current findings on factors influencing the biodiversity and functioning of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The influence of changes to groundwater on GDE biodiversity and future threats posed by climate change is reviewed, using information mainly from surface water studies and knowledge of aquifer and groundwater ecosystems. Several gaps in research are identified. Due to lack of understanding of several key processes, the uncertainty associated with management techniques such as numerical modelling is high. The possibilities and roles of new methodologies such as indicators and modelling methods are discussed in the context of integrated groundwater resources management.

While many ground-based reports of declining vegetation productivity have been published over the last decades, a number of recent publications have shown a nuanced and, for some regions, positive picture. With this background, the paper provides an analysis of trends in vegetation greenness of semi-arid areas using AVHRR GIMMS from 1981 to 2007. The vegetation index dataset is used as a proxy for vegetation productivity and trends are analyzed for characterization of changes in semi-arid vegetation greenness. Calculated vegetation trends are analyzed with gridded data on potential climatic constraints to plant growth to explore possible causes of the observed changes. An analysis of changes in the seasonal variation of vegetation greenness and climatic drivers is conducted for selected regions to further understand the causes of observed inter-annual vegetation changes in semi-arid areas across the globe. It is concluded that semi-arid areas, across the globe, on average experience an increase in greenness (0.015 NDVI units over the period of analysis). Further it is observed that increases in greenness are found both in semi-arid areas where precipitation is the dominating limiting factor for plant production (0.019 NDVI units) and in semi-arid areas where air temperature is the primarily growth constraint (0.013 NDVI units). Finally, in the analysis of changes in the intra-annual variation of greenness it is found that seemingly similar increases in greenness over the study period may have widely different explanations. This implies that current generalizations, claiming that land degradation is ongoing in semi-arid areas worldwide, are not supported by the satellite based analysis of vegetation greenness. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:07:23","2019-06-28T18:07:23Z",NA,"144–158","","",121,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"AVHRR GIMMS NDVI; Air temperature; Incoming shortwave radiation; MODIS NDVI; Phenology; Precipitation; Semi-arid; Vegetation greenness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scholars have suggested that the governance of complex systems should be dispersed across multiple centers of authority and that any regulative system needs as much variety in the actions that it can take as exists in the system it is regulating. Further, it has been argued that complex ecosystems and biodiversity can successfully be maintained by complex, polycentric, multi-layered governance systems which have a variety of response mechanisms. But how should polycentric governance of biodiversity be organized? Borrowing from the organization of public economies in metropolitan areas we distinguish between production and provision of public ecosystem services and suggest the direction of institutional change for the organization of a public ecosystem service economy. If the market alone cannot solve the allocation of public ecosystem services, economic efficiency criteria based on hypothetical markets are not sufficient. Therefore, we suggest design principles which go beyond economic efficiency and provide examples of the emergence of polycentric governance from an Ethiopian coffee forest conservation project.",2006,"2019-06-28 18:07:21","2019-06-28T18:07:21Z",NA,"296–304","","3",59,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity features and functions; Complexity; Economic efficiency; Institutions; Polycentric governance",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One hundred catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were collected randomly from the Marais Dam (MD) and the Rietvlei Dam (RVD) in the Rietvlei Nature Reserve (RNR), South Africa. These dams drain water from a stream that receives effluent from industrial sites, agricultural activities, informal settlements, and municipal treatment plants. Each fish was evaluated macroscopically and had blood drawn, and its gonads were macroscopically and histologically examined to verify intersex potentially related to endocrine disruption. Gonadal histology of several fish showed primary oocytes scattered in testicular tissue, indicative of intersex. The results showed intersexuality in 20% of fish from both the dams. The GSI value for intersex fish was closer to male GSI values, suggesting that the sampled intersex fish were more likely to have occurred from the feminization of male catfish. Target chemical analyses showed that the water, sediment, and serum samples tested positive for p-nonylphenol (p-NP). The p-NP level in water and sediment at MD was 6360 and 4.0 microg/kg, respectively, whereas in sediment at RVD it was 113 microg/kg.

Many are projected to shift further from being grass-dominated to shrub-dominated by 2050 under global climate change and land use change projections. This paper used long-term surveys and repeat photography to assess vegetation change at the shrubland-grassland ecotone in semi-arid, South Africa. Changes in several climate variables as well as in the cover of grasses and dwarf shrubs over three time periods (1962, 1989 and 2009) were investigated at eight localities within a broad 500km ecotone between the Grassland and Nama-karoo biomes. Results showed that for most sites grass cover has increased and that dwarf shrub cover has decreased over time. This contradicts earlier views which warned against the expansion of dwarf shrublands in response to over-grazing as well as more recent views which suggest that more mesic biomes in the Karoo Midlands will contract in response to climate-induced aridification. The decline in stocking densities and more conservation-friendly land management practices together with an increase in large wet events in the Nama-karoo biome may have contributed to the increase in grass cover. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:07:12","2019-06-28T18:07:12Z",NA,"43–51","","",104,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Central interior of South Africa; Climate change; Ecotone; Growth forms; Long-term change; Nama-karoo biome; Overgrazing; Rainfall; Shrub expansion; Temporal change and vegetation cover",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the most arid phase, there was extremely low pollen production and limited charred-particle deposition, indicating insufficient vegetation to maintain substantial fires, and the Lake Malawi watershed experienced cool, semidesert conditions (\textless400 mm/yr precipitation). Fossil and sedimentological data show that Lake Malawi itself, currently 706 m deep, was reduced to an approximately 125 m deep saline, alkaline, well mixed lake. This episode of aridity was far more extreme than any experienced in the Afrotropics during the Last Glacial Maximum (approximately 35-15 ka). Aridity diminished after 95 ka, lake levels rose erratically, and salinity/alkalinity declined, reaching near-modern conditions after 60 ka. This record of lake levels and changing limnological conditions provides a framework for interpreting the evolution of the Lake Malawi fish and invertebrate species flocks. Moreover, this record, coupled with other regional records of early Late Pleistocene aridity, places new constraints on models of Afrotropical biogeographic refugia and early modern human population expansion into and out of tropical Africa.",2007,"2019-06-28 18:07:00","2019-06-28T18:07:00Z",NA,"16422–7","","42",104,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17925446",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Air Conditioning; Animals; Disasters; Ecology; Fishes; Fossils; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Humans; Humidity; Paleontology; Population; Tropical Climate",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. Similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. Fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. In particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. Insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. Of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (Anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally Vulnerable because of habitat loss. This species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. Of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only Orthoptera responded positively to burning. However, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. This reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:06:58","2019-06-28T18:06:58Z",NA,"258–270","","",158,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Arthropods; Birds; Disturbance; Fire; Grasslands; Grazing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is perhaps more so in the African regional context where the complex relationships between modern and traditional governance systems and global change dynamics are arguably more pronounced.The Earth System Governance (ESG) Analytical Framework encompasses diverse systems and actors involved in the regulation of societal activities and behaviors vis-??-vis earth system dynamics. The concept encompasses a myriad of public and private actors and actor networks at all levels of policy and decision-making. The existence of, and interaction among, these diverse actors and systems, however, is under-researched in the African context. Various research approaches taken to address crucial global environmental change (GEC) challenges in Africa have proven to be inadequate because they tend to overlook the complex interactions among the various local actors, players, and indigenous conditions and practices vis-??-vis GEC system drivers and teleconnections. Similarly, the regional peculiarities in terms of governance typologies and socio-cultural diversity highlight the need for nuanced understanding of the complex interactions and nexuses among multiple actors and interests and Earth system processes.

In the western part of the Tarangire–Manyara ecosystem, we assessed large mammal species richness along a land-use gradient (national park, uninhabited pastoral area and settled pastoral- and farmland). We found the highest species richness in the national park and in the pastoral area and lowest species richness in the settled and farmed area. There was little evidence of seasonal changes in species diversity. Except for top-order carnivores, all functional feeding guilds were still represented in pastoral and settled areas. Although we did not find significant differences in body mass distributions and species' representation of feeding guilds between the study sites, there was a trend that omnivores, mesopredators and top-order carnivores tended to occur at lower species richness in agricultural areas than in the pastoral and fully protected areas. These results indicate that areas used for livestock keeping can maintain high wildlife species richness and that direct and indirect effects of agricultural and settlement expansions are the main drivers of species richness loss in the Tarangire–Manyara ecosystem and possibly other African savannah ecosystems. These results are useful for informed land-use planning that aims to maintain species diversity and ecological connectivity between protected areas. Les changements d'occupation des sols sont considérés comme un facteur majeur de la perte de biodiversité. Dans la partie ouest de l'écosystème de Tarangire-Manyara, nous avons évalué la richesse en espèces de grands mammifères le long d'un gradient d'occupation des terres (parc national, surface pastorale non habitée, surface pastorale habitée et terres agricoles). Nous avons relevé la plus grande richesse en espèces dans le parc national et dans l'aire pastorale, et la plus faible dans les aires habitées et cultivées. Il y avait peu d'indices de changements saisonniers de la diversité des espèces. À l'exception des carnivores supérieurs, toutes les guildes alimentaires fonctionnelles étaient encore représentées dans les zones pastorales et habitées. Si nous n'avons pas trouvé entre les sites étudiés de différences significatives dans la distribution des masses corporelles et dans la représentation des espèces appartenant aux différentes guildes alimentaires, il semble cependant que la richesse en omnivores, méso-prédateurs et carnivores d'ordre supérieur avait tendance à être plus faible dans les aires agricoles que dans les zones pastorales et celles qui étaient totalement protégées. Ces résultats indiquent que les zones utilisées pour y garder le bétail peuvent conserver une grande diversité en espèces de faune sauvage, et que les effets directs et indirects de l'extension des installations agricoles et humaines sont les principaux facteurs de la perte de diversité en espèces dans l'écosystème de Tarangire-Manyara et, éventuellement, dans d'autres écosystèmes de savane africaine.

The red fox is known to be one of the major threats to the persistence of small and medium-sized native vertebrates across the continent. Location Australia. Methods Indices of abundance were calculated from three independently collected datasets derived from bounty returns and field surveys. Data were analysed using univariate parametric, semi-parametric and nonparametric techniques. Results Predator abundance indices did not conform to a normal distribution and the relationships between dingo and fox abundance indices were not well described by linear functions. Semi-parametric and nonparametric techniques revealed consistently negative associations between indices of dingo and fox abundance. Main conclusions The results provide evidence that mesopredator suppression by a top predator can be exerted at very large geographical scales and suggest that relationships between the abundances of top predators and mesopredators are not linear. Our results have broad implications for the management of canid predators. First, they suggest that dingoes function ecologically to reduce the activity or abundance of red foxes and thus are likely to dampen the predatory impacts of foxes. More generally, they provide support for the notion that the mesopredator-suppressive effects of top predators could be incorporated into broad-scale biodiversity conservation programmes in many parts of the world by actively maintaining populations of top predators or restoring them in areas where they are now rare. Determining the population densities at which the interactions of top predators become ecologically effective will be a critical goal for conservation managers who aim to maintain or restore ecosystems using the ecological interactions of top predators.

In addition to considering interactions, different characterisations of climate change, land-use change and biodiversity greatly influence estimates. Habitat loss leading to decreased species richness is the most common land-use change and biodiversity relationship considered with less attention being given to other land-use changes (e.g. other conversions, fragmentation, different management intensities) and biodiversity characterisations and responses (e.g. selected groups of species, increased species richness).

Visible evidence of environmental changes apparent from the paired photographs was analyzed using an expert rating system. The conditions of the woody vegetation, soil and water conservation structures and land management were worse in the earlier periods compared to their present conditions. The cover by indigenous trees is a notable exception: it peaked in the 1930s, declined afterwards and then achieved a second peak in the early 21st century. Particularly in areas with greater population densities, there has been a significant increase in woody vegetation and soil and water conservation structures over the course of the study period. We conclude that except for an apparent upward movement of the upper tree limit, the direct human impacts on the environment are overriding the effects of climate change in the north Ethiopian highlands and that the northern Ethiopian highlands are currently greener than at any other time in the last 145years. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:06:29","2019-06-28T18:06:29Z",NA,"164–179","","1","485-486",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24717722",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental rehabilitation; Land management; Reforestation; Repeat photography; Soil and water conservation; Woody vegetation",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An increasing number of people globally require ever more materials (including energy carriers), land and water for rising living standards and lifestyles converging towards western, industrialised patterns. Therefore, these resources will continue becoming both scarcer and depleted, while environmental impacts associated with their consumption, e.g. run-away climate change, will continue to rise. For effective resource policies, drivers for such unsustainable resource use and their effects need to be better understood and mapped.By means of meta-analysis of more than 60 sources of relevant literature, we identified a set of ten driver categories that affect unsustainable resource use, inter alia prevailing consumption and production patterns, use and design of infrastructure and technology, underlying paradigms and world views, resource prices and the level of knowledge and information of resource users. Cumulative effects of the drivers contribute, for instance, up to 30% of phosphorus loss from soil and around 30% of building energy loss globally. Although the data does not allow clear-cut causal attribution of effects, it enables the distinction between direct and indirect drivers.In relation to a multi-dimensional network of drivers causing unsustainable resource use, resource policy should combine policy objectives and instruments into policy mixes to target key drivers and their interrelations. While policy mixes need to respond to context specific driver settings, targeting consumer behaviour emerges as a general driver focus of policy mixes. Combining different instrument types and implementing them in a time-dynamic sequence can mitigate trade-offs between different instruments and in the longer-term increase feasibility of profound behaviour changes.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:06:20","2019-06-28T18:06:20Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Causal network; Consumer behaviour; Driver; Policy mix; Unsustainable resource use",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is partly caused by insufficient knowledge about the economic and ecological value of mangrove ecosystems, which provide important ecosystem services, such as fish, flood prevention, erosion prevention, water regulation, and timber products. A strategy to improve mangrove ecosystem management would be to improve public understanding of the ecosystem's values. We studied these drivers on a regional scale, using socio-economic and grey literature and consultations with experts, thereby focusing on the period from 1980 to 2006. Wood harvesting, conversion of mangroves for agriculture, and bio-fuel plantations were important drivers of mangrove forest change. Coastal development is the most important direct driver of mangrove forest change, especially between 2000 and 2006, a period that coincides with large oil discoveries in the region. About 60% of all industries within the region are located near the coast, which is expected to attract about 50 million people by 2025. Future policies should target the risks of declining mangrove ecosystems in West-Central Africa. This requires focusing on adaptive strategies, reviewing existing coastal and marine ecosystem policies, and developing an integrated coastal management strategy for the region. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:06:18","2019-06-28T18:06:18Z",NA,"217–230","","November","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"change; drivers of mangrove forest; ecosystem services; mangroves; sustainability; west-central africa",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Total Wildlife Reserve of Bontioli (TWRB) in Burkina Faso is one of the country's refuges with high biodiversity. This reserve is seriously threatened by human activities, and little information is available about the on-site causes of degradation extent. This study was carried out to investigate drivers and extent of LDD in the TWRB. Household surveys, focus group discussions and field observations were used to identify socio-economic factors that influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The socio-economic data were analyzed using rankings and binary logistic regression techniques. Logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between socio-economic drivers and land cover change. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to analyze land use and LULC changes over 29 years, employing Landsat images of 1984, 2001 and 2013. We performed a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood algorithm to derive vegetation maps. The results revealed significant (p \textless0.05) LULC change from one class of LULC to another. From 1984 to 2001, tree savannas, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 17.55%, 18.79% and 21778.79%, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, shrub savannas and water bodies decreased by 22.02%, 5.03%, 40.08% and 31.2%, respectively. From 2001 to 2013, gallery forests decreased by 14.33%, tree savannas by 22.30% and shrub savannas by 5.14%, while agricultural lands increased by 167.87% and woodlands by 3.21%. LDD occurred at a higher rate in areas bordering the reserve compared to the core-protected area and the inaccessible areas. Agricultural expansion and wood cutting activities were the main direct causes of LDD. Extensive land utilization for agriculture is a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in this reserve. The research highlighted the soundness of GIS and remote sensing practical application to assess vegetation change extent in Burkina Faso. Understanding the signal extent of vegetation change is particularly important to support efforts by policy makers to halt or at least to slow down the deforestation in the country. There is a need to control the immediate causes of LULC dynamics by limiting agricultural land expansion and wood cutting in the study area.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:06:15","2019-06-28T18:06:15Z",NA,"559–571","","","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation; Bontioli reserve; Diachronic analysis; Land degradation drivers; Land use; Sustainable use",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we analyse results from an attribution modelling system designed to examine how anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have contributed to weather and flood risk in our current climate. The system is based on comparison of real world climate and hydrological simulations with parallel counterfactual simulations of the climate and hydrological responses under conditions that might have been had human activities not emitted greenhouse gases. The analyses allow us to address the question of whether anthropogenic climate change contributed to increasing the risk of these high flood events in the Okavango system.Results show that the probability of occurrence of high floods during 2009-2011 in the current climate is likely lower than it would have been in a climate without anthropogenic greenhouse gases. This result is robust across the two climate models and various data processing procedures, although the exact figures for the associated decrease in risk differ. Results also differ between the three years examined, indicating that the ""time-slice"" method used here needs to be applied to multiple years in order to accurately estimate the contribution of emissions to current risk. Simple sensitivity analyses indicate that the reduction in flood risk is attributed to higher temperatures (and thus evaporation) in the current world, with little difference in the analysed domain's rainfall simulated in the two scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:06:13","2019-06-28T18:06:13Z",NA,"350–358","","","511",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Anthropogenic climate change; Attribution; Flood; Okavango",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"PMU9PT97","thesis",2010,"Archibald, Sally","Fire regimes in southern Africa - determinants, drivers and feedbacks","","","","","","The spatial and temporal patterns of fire in Africa south of the equator are described and investigated to test hypotheses on the main drivers of fire. In particular, the relative importance of climate, vegetation, and human activities are assessed and related to current theory on savanna fire regimes and their response to global change. This thesis makes use of newly-released burned area and fire radiative power data derived from satellite imagery. This information was integrated with data on climate, vegetation, and human activities, as well as long-term field data on fire, to test hypothe- ses about savanna fire regimes. Regression tree techniques and mixed effects models were used to determine the main drivers of spatial and temporal variability in fire, and feedbacks between fire and tree cover were explored at a range of spatial scales. New datasets on fire size and fire number were also developed to test theories on the effect of human activities on ignition probability and fire spread. The results show that fire in these grassy ecosystems is very responsive to climatic factors such as rainfall but there are large areas where human activities play an equally significant role. The effect of people was always to reduce the total area burned, although the number of individual fires increased with population density up to about 10 people per km2. Areas inhabited by people were also less susceptible to year-to-year fluctuations in annual burned area caused by climatic variability, possibly because of the reduced probability of large, runaway fires in these highly-impacted landscapes. Both of these findings are important for modelling of fire and carbon emissions in Africa. Evidence of negative feedbacks between tree cover and fire were found. When the percentage tree cover is less than 40% a range of factors control the extent of fire in a system; but above 40% tree cover fire is never a large component of the landscape. On the other hand, tree cover was shown to have a bi-modal distribution, and examples of intermediate tree cover (40-70%) were rare. Over a wide range of mean annual rainfall (1000-2000mm) vegetation can exist either in a &#34;high tree-cover, low fire&#34; or a &#34;high fire, low tree cover&#34; state. This research challenges some assumptions about how savanna fires will respond to global change, and provides important clues to help disentangle the mechanisms driving fire in Southern Africa. Importantly, it highlights that fire in southern Africa, and in other highly-utilised savanna systems, can not be understood outside the context of human use.",2010,"2019-06-28 18:06:05","2019-06-28T18:06:05Z",NA,"","1–165","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"PhD Thesis",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Southern Africa; fire ecology; savanna ecology; ve",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find that-as opposed to a relationship with only mean annual rainfall-the upper limit of fractional woody vegetation cover is strongly influenced by both the quantity and intensity of rainfall events. Using a set of statistics derived from the seasonal distribution of rainfall, we show that areas with similar seasonal rainfall totals have higher fractional woody cover if the local rainfall climatology consists of frequent, less intense precipitation events. Based on these observations, we develop a generalized response surface between rainfall climatology and maximum woody vegetation cover across the African continent. The normalized local gradient of this response surface is used as an estimator of ecosystem vegetation sensitivity to climatological variation. A comparison between predicted climate sensitivity patterns and observed shifts in both rainfall and vegetation during 2009 reveals both the importance of rainfall climatology in governing how ecosystems respond to inter-annual fluctuations in climate and the utility of our framework as a means to forecast continental-scale patterns of vegetation shifts in response to future climate change.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:06:02","2019-06-28T18:06:02Z",NA,"4902–4907","","12","108",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21383125",NA,NA,NA,"Science & Technology - Other Topics; climate; cover; ecohydrology; intraannual variability; performance; potential; precipitation; quantile regression; rainfall; remote sensing; satellite; savannas; terrestrial ecosystems; tree cover; variability; vegetation indexes",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This will increase the frequency of climate-related hazards, causing loss of life, social disruption and economic hardships. There is less consensus on the magnitude of change of climatic variables, but several studies have shown that climate change will impact on the availability and demand for water resources. In southern Africa, climate change is likely to affect nearly every aspect of human well-being, from agricultural productivity and energy use to flood control, municipal and industrial water supply to wildlife management, since the region is characterised by highly spatial and temporally variable rainfall and, in some cases, scarce water resources. Vulnerability is exacerbated by the region's low adaptive capacity, widespread poverty and low technology uptake. This paper reviews the potential impacts of climate change on water resources in southern Africa. The outcomes of this review include highlighting studies on detected climate changes particularly focusing on temperature and rainfall. Additionally, the impacts of climate change are highlighted, and respective studies on hydrological responses to climate change are examined. The review also discusses the challenges in climate change impact analysis, which inevitably represents existing research and knowledge gaps. Finally the paper concludes by outlining possible research areas in the realm of climate change impacts on water resources, particularly knowledge gaps in uncertainty analysis for both climate change and hydrological modelling.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:06:01","2019-06-28T18:06:01Z",NA,"47–54","","","67-69",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Hydrological modelling; Southern Africa; Uncertainty; Water resources",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition–two processes important in all ecosystems–are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40%) reduced plant production by 5-10%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO(2) and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO(2) and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:05:57","2019-06-28T18:05:57Z",NA,"105–108","","7401","486",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22678289",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This lake has historically supported a highly productive pelagic fishery that currently provides 25-40% of the animal protein supply for the populations of the surrounding countries. In parallel with regional warming patterns since the beginning of the twentieth century, a rise in surface-water temperature has increased the stability of the water column. A regional decrease in wind velocity has contributed to reduced mixing, decreasing deep-water nutrient upwelling and entrainment into surface waters. Carbon isotope records in sediment cores suggest that primary productivity may have decreased by about 20%, implying a roughly 30% decrease in fish yields.

Using field data collected throughout arid Australia, we provide evidence that removal of an alien top-predator, the dingo, has cascading effects through lower trophic levels. Dingo removal was linked to increased activity of herbivores and an invasive mesopredator, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and to the loss of grass cover and native species of small mammals. Using species distribution data, we predict that reintroducing or maintaining dingo populations would produce a net benefit for the conservation of threatened native mammals across greater than 2.42 x 10(6) km(2) of Australia.

The analysis shows that migration to urban centers in mega-deltas is an outcome of many forces: economic policies and incentives, local and destination institutions, government policies to develop small towns, and the geographic concentration of investments. Massive influx of capital to many deltas has transformed the local economic base from a primarily agricultural one to a manufacturing and processing economy. This has created uneven spatial economic development which is the underlying driver of migration to cities in the mega-deltas regardless of geographic context or size. Going forward to 2060, one critical challenge for all the deltas is to increase the labor skill of their workforce and foster technology innovation. Continued economic growth in these regions will require substantial investments in education and capacity building and the ability of urban centers to absorb the migrant labor pool. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:05:49","2019-06-28T18:05:49Z",NA,"","","SUPPL. 1","21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Drivers of migration; Economic reforms; Globalization; Rural-urban migration; Sea level rise; Urban growth; Urbanization",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding degradation drivers and patterns is therefore crucial to managing forests to mitigate climate change and reduce biodiversity loss. Putative patterns of degradation affecting forest stocks, carbon, and biodiversity have variously been described previously, but these have not been quantitatively assessed together or tested systematically. Economic theory predicts a systematic allocation of land to its highest use value in response to distance from centers of demand. We tested this theory to see if forest exploitation would expand through time and space as concentric waves, with each wave targeting lower value products. We used forest data along a transect from 10 to 220 km from Dar es Salaam (DES), Tanzania, collected at two points in time (1991 and 2005). Our predictions were confirmed: high-value logging expanded 9 km.y(-1), and an inner wave of lower value charcoal production 2 km.y(-1). This resource utilization is shown to reduce the public goods of carbon storage and species richness, which significantly increased with each kilometer from DES [carbon, 0.2 Mg.ha(-1); 0.1 species per sample area (0.4 ha)]. Our study suggests that tropical forest degradation can be modeled and predicted, with its attendant loss of some public goods.

The underlying cause of most plant EIDs is the anthropogenic introduction of parasites, although severe weather events are also important drivers of disease emergence.

A total of 48 indicators provided information for biophysical conditions and socioeconomic characteristics measured at the plot level. The selected indicators refer to farm characteristics (family status, land tenure, present and previous types of land-use, soil depth, slope gradient, tillage operations) and to site-specific characteristics including annual rainfall, rainfall seasonality and water availability. Classes were designated for each indicator and a sensitivity score was assigned to each class based on existing research or empirically assessing the importance of each indicator to the land abandonment issue. Questionnaires for each process of land degradation were prepared and data were collected at field site level in collaboration with land users. Based on correlation statistics and multivariate analyses more than ten indicators out of 48 resulted as significant in affecting land abandonment in the studied field sites.

To address this gap, we explored how land use practices impacted species richness in a mammalian community in northern Tanzania. Using camera traps, we estimated the number of mammalian species inhabiting three land use types subjected to increasing levels of anthropogenic pressure: (1) Tarangire National Park, (2) pastoral grazing areas; and (3) cultivated areas outside the park. Results showed that land use practice is correlated with different levels of species richness. Interestingly, mammal species richness was highest in the grazing areas and lowest in cultivated areas. When we focused our analyses on carnivores, we found little significant difference in species richness between the park and pastoral grazing areas, however, carnivore richness were significantly lower in the cultivated areas. We found no significant link between species body weight and presence in the three areas considered.

In Italy A. dealbata has been largely used for ornamental and forestry purpose and is nowadays spreading in several areas. The present study was addressed to evaluate the impacts on soil chemical properties, soil microbial communities and understory plant communities and to assess the relationships among these compartments after the invasion of A. dealbata in a typical Mediterranean shrubland. Towards these aims, a soil and vegetation sampling was performed in Elba Island where A. dealbata is invading the sclerophyllous native vegetation. Three levels of invasion status were differentiated according to the gradient from invaded, to transitional and non-invaded vegetation. Quantitative and qualitative alterations of soil chemical properties and microbial communities (i.e. bacterial and fungal communities) and above-ground understory plant communities were found. In particular, the invaded soils had lower pH values than both the non-invaded and transitional ones. High differences were detected for both the total N and the inorganic fraction (NH4+ and NO3-) contents, which showed the ranking: invaded\textgreatertransitional\textgreaternon-invaded soils. TOC and C/N ratio showed respectively higher and lower values in invaded than in non-invaded soils. Total plant covers, species richness and diversity in both the non-invaded and transitional subplots were higher than those in the invaded ones. The contribution of the nitrophilous species was significantly different among the three invasion statuses, with a strong increase going from native to transitional and invaded subplots.

The linear relationships of LogeRainfall with NPP and ??NDVI were calculated for every pixel. Vegetation production generally had a strong relationship with rainfall over most of SA. Therefore, human-induced land degradation can only be detected if its impacts on vegetation production can be distinguished from the effects of rainfall. Two methods were tested (i) Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE=NPP/Rainfall or ??NDVI/Rainfall) and (ii) Residual Trends (RESTREND), i.e. negative trends in the differences between the observed ??NDVI and the ??NDVI predicted by the rainfall. Degraded areas mapped by the National Land Cover in north-eastern SA had reduced RUE; however, annual RUE had a very strong negative correlation with rainfall and varied greatly between years. Therefore, RUE was not a reliable indicator of degradation. The RESTREND method showed promising results at a national scale and in the Limpopo Province, where negative trends were often associated with degraded areas in communal lands. Both positive and negative residual trends can, however, result from natural ecological processes, e.g. the carryover effects of rainfall in previous years. Thus, the RESTREND method can only identify potential problem areas at a regional scale, while the cause of negative trends has to be determined by local investigations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Information on the performance of trees species is important as plants are key in the revegetation of exhausted quarries. A comparison of field performance of Acacia xanthophloea, Schinus molle, Casuarina equisetifolia and Grevillea robusta was made in an exhausted limestone quarry, backfilled with limestone mine waste, in a semi-arid area, in Athi River, Kenya, between 2005 and 2008. The aim of the study was to assess the performance of the above tree species and to determine if these tree species had an influence on the soil physical and chemical properties. The seedlings were produced in a nursery and transplanted in plots established in the exhausted quarry site using randomised complete block design. Growth performances were estimated by measuring; tree height, diameter at the stem base (BD), and diameter at breast height (DBH) from March 2006 to March 2008. The soils physical and chemical parameters measured were: moisture content; organic matter; pH; total Nitrogen; total Phosphorus and exchangeable cations. The study revealed that the time-species interaction was significant (p\textless0.001), indicating continuous tree growth for all the species. The trees species performance was varied. C. equisetifolia recorded the highest growth increments for the; height (525.3 cm), BD (7.42 cm) and DBH (4.94 cm) and the highest growth rates for; tree height (14.24 cm/month), BD (0.23 cm/month) and DBH (0.14 cm/month), indicating superior performance. This was followed by A. xanthophloea and S. molle. Grevillea robusta showed poor performance and recorded the lowest growth increments for; height (231.7 cm), BD (4.41 cm) and BDH (2.0 cm) and growth rate for; tree height (5.04 cm/month), BD (0.084 cm/month) and DBH (0.023 cm/month). These results indicate that there is species-specific response that may be due to different water- and nutrient-use strategies and growth patterns. The soil had low soil moisture content which ranged from 0.67% to 2.3%; alkaline pH, ranging from 8.0 to 8.98; low soil nitrogen content (\textless 0.03%), related to the limited soil organic-matter content (ranging from 0.05% to 0.38%), and high to moderate exchangeable cations. All the tree species had a noticeable influence on soil chemical properties, by the end of the research period. The pH values and total Phosphorus were relatively lower in soils close to the tree row (0.5 m) and increased with distance from the trees, while the soil values for organic matter, total Nitrogen, and exchangeable cations were relatively higher close to the tree row and decreased with distance from the trees. From the study, C. equisetifolia has the best growth performance and also has a higher positive influence on the soil properties followed by A. xanthophloea.

At the proximate level, these factors drive cropland expansion, overgrazing, and infrastructure extension. Identifiable regional patterns of synergies among causal factors, in combination with feedback mechanisms and regional land-use and environmental histories, make up specific pathways of land change for each region and time period.

Decadal analyses of temperatures strongly point to an increased warming trend across the continent over the last 50 to 100 years. Mean annual temperature rise over Africa, relative to the late 20th century mean annual temperature, is likely to exceed 2°C in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B and A2 scenarios by the end of this century (medium confidence). Warming projections under medium scenarios indicate that extensive areas of Africa will exceed 2°C by the last 2 decades of this century relative to the late 20th century mean annual temperature and all of Africa under high emission scenarios. Under a high Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), that exceedance could occur by mid-century across much of Africa and reach between 3°C and 6°C by the end of the century. It is likely that land temperatures over Africa will rise faster than the global land average, particularly in the more arid regions, and that the rate of increase in minimum temperatures will exceed that of maximum temperature. A reduction in precipitation is likely over Northern Africa and the southwestern parts of South Africa by the end of the 21st century under the SRES A1B and A2 scenarios (medium to high confidence). Projected rainfall change over sub-Saharan Africa in the mid- and late 21st century is uncertain. In regions of high or complex topography such as the Ethiopian Highlands, downscaled projections indicate likely increases in rainfall and extreme rainfall by the end of the 21st century. African ecosystems are already being affected by climate change, and future impacts are expected to be substantial (high confidence). There is emerging evidence on shifting ranges of some species and ecosystems due to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and climate change, beyond the effects of land use change and other non-climate stressors (high confidence). Ocean ecosystems, in particular coral reefs, will be affected by ocean acidification and warming as well as changes in ocean upwellings, thus negatively affecting economic sectors such as fisheries (medium confidence).",2014,"2019-06-28 18:05:04","2019-06-28T18:05:04Z",NA,"1199–1265","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"adaptation; climate change impacts; vulnerability",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This analysis supports the hypothesis that the spatial pattern of fire regime is strongly influenced by the environmental template defined by climatic, geological, pedological and vegetation features. Moreover, contrary to some previous studies, together with the precipitation trend, fire management changes had a significant role in determining the temporal variability of the fire regime at the scale of KNP, particularly regarding the burnt area and the fire frequency.

Competitive tenders and fixed price grants can both be applied to achieve the same environmental outcomes. In the case study described in this paper, the efficiencies of the two methods are compared. Operationally, the two mechanisms are similar in both cost and process. Both mechanisms have very important indirect benefits of building skills and knowledge in both landholders and the implementing agency, and building trust between the two. However, the heterogeneity in landholdersâ€™ opportunity costs revealed in the competitive tender trial means a discriminatory price mechanism is more efficient at matching program costs with direct environmental benefits. In terms of transfer payments, the competitive tender was 30% more cost efficient than a fixed price grant scheme. While the initial design and development costs of a tender may be greater than a grant, there was no evidence of any difference in operating costs in this case study. There was also little evidence of any indirect costs associated with the tender process, but it may be too early to make a realistic assessment.",2008,"2019-06-28 18:05:01","2019-06-28T18:05:01Z",NA,"388–398","","3","25",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Competitive tender; Conservation auction; Grant; Rangelands",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Biofuel expansion in the region reflects policy concerns related to energy security, poverty alleviation and economic development. However, biofuels have also been linked to numerous environmental and socioeconomic impacts such as GHG emissions, water availability/pollution, deforestation, biodiversity loss, poverty alleviation, energy security, loss of access to land and food security to name just a few. Yet there is (a) an insufficient understanding of these impacts (and their synergies) in Sub-Sahara Africa, and (b) a lack of policies that could regulate the biofuel sector and ensure its viability while at the same time preventing its negative impact. The aim of this literature review is to synthesize the current knowledge about biofuel impacts in Africa and to identify priority policy areas that should be targeted for enhancing biofuel sustainability in the continent. The findings of this review indicate that biofuel impacts can be positive or negative depending on several factors such as the feedstock, the environmental/socio-economic context of biofuel production, and the policy instruments in place during biofuel production, use and trade. In most cases there are significant trade-offs but at least part of the negative impacts can be mitigated through careful planning. The incomplete and piecemeal understanding of these trade-offs combined with agronomic, institutional and market failures are currently the most important barriers for the viability and sustainability of biofuel investments in the continent.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:04:57","2019-06-28T18:04:57Z",NA,"879–901","","","45",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biofuel policies; Biofuels; Jatropha; Sub-Sahara Africa; Sugarcane; Sustainability impacts",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We mapped the LULC distribution of the desert landscape for 1988, 1999, and 2011. Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 data and ancillary data were classified using the random forests approach. The technique produced LULC maps with an overall accuracy of more than 90%. Analysis of LULC classes from the three dates revealed that the study areawas subjected to three different stages of modification, each dominated by different land uses. The use of a spatially explicit land use change modeling approach, such as Markov-CA approach, provides ways for projecting different future scenarios. Markov-CAwas used to predict land use change in 2011 and project changes in 2023 by extrapolating current trends. The technique was successful in predicting LULC distribution in 2011 and the results were comparable to the actual LULC for 2011. The projected LULC for 2023 revealed more urbanization of the landscape with potential expansion in the croplands westward and northward, an increase in quarries, and growth in residential centers.

Part of the problem is that the social value of biodiversity is unknown, and thus the potential impact of a loss of biodiversity on social wellbeing is not recognised. Some of these threats, particularly climate change, are predicted to have major impacts on biodiversity within the next 50 years. This study investigates the public interest, experience and knowledge of biodiversity and uses contingent valuation methods to estimate its existence value, with emphasis on the internationally significant fynbos biome in the Western Cape. More than half of respondents classified themselves as actively or passionately interested in nature, and a high proportion had recently visited major nature reserves. Interest was correlated with knowledge, and both were positively correlated with willingness to pay (WTP) for biodiversity conservation, though WTP was constrained by income level. WTP for conservation was relatively high ($3.3 million per year for fynbos, $58 million for national biodiversity), and comparable with government conservation budgets. WTP increased dramatically (to up to $15 million and $263 million per year, respectively) when respondents were faced with the predicted impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

The summer meteorological scenario in North Africa (aloft 850 hPa) is characterized by a high over the the subtropical Sahara and a low over the tropics linked to the monsoon. We measured the variability of this high–low dipole-like pattern in terms of the North African dipole intensity (NAFDI): the difference of geopotential height anomalies averaged over the subtropics (30–32° N, Morocco) and the tropics (10–13° N, Bamako region) close to the Atlantic coast (at 5–8° W). We focused on the 700 hPa standard level due to dust export off the coast of North Africa tending to occur between 1 and 5 km a.s.l. Variability in the NAFDI is associated with displacements of the North African anticyclone over the Sahara and this has implications for wind and dust export. The correlations we found between the 1987–2014 summer mean of NAFDI with dust at Izaña, satellite dust observations and meteorological re-analysis data indicate that increases in the NAFDI (i) result in higher wind speeds at the north of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone that are associated with enhanced dust export over the subtropical North Atlantic, (ii) influence the long-term variability of the size distribution of exported dust particles (increasing the load of coarse dust) and (iii) are associated with enhanced rains in the tropical and northern shifts of the tropical rain band that may affect the southern Sahel. Interannual variability in NAFDI is also connected to spatial distribution of dust over the North Atlantic; high NAFDI summers are associated with major dust export (linked to winds) in the subtropics and minor dust loads in the tropics (linked to higher rainfall), and vice versa. The evolution of the summer NAFDI values since 1950 to the present day shows connections to climatic variability (through the Sahelian drought, ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) and winds) that have implications for dust export paths. Efforts to anticipate how dust export may evolve in future decades will require a better understanding of how the large-scale meteorological systems represented by the NAFD will evolve.\textless/p\textgreater",2015,"2019-06-28 18:04:49","2019-06-28T18:04:49Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fifty-two historical photographs of the Palgrave Expedition of 1876 were re-photographed and used to document changes over more than 130years, in grass, shrub and tree cover within three major biomes along a 1200km climatic gradient in central and southern Namibia. We showed that patterns of change are correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and that below a threshold of around 250mm, vegetation has remained remarkably stable regardless of land-use or tenure regime. Above this threshold, an increase in tree cover is linked to the rainfall gradient, the legacies of historical events in the late 19th century, subsequent transformations in land-use and increased atmospheric CO 2. We discuss these findings in relation to pastoral and settler societies, paleo- and historical climatic trends and predictions of vegetation change under future global warming scenarios. We argue that changes in land-use associated with colonialism (decimation of megaherbivores and wildlife browsers; fire suppression, cattle ranching), as well as the effects of CO 2 fertilisation provide the most parsimonious explanations for vegetation change. We found no evidence that aridification, as projected under future climate change scenarios, has started in the region. This study provided empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the relative importance of local and global drivers of change in the savanna environments of central and southern Namibia and global savanna ecosystems more generally. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:04:47","2019-06-28T18:04:47Z",NA,"276–288","","","416",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22188617",NA,NA,NA,"Bush encroachment; Climate change; Colonial ecological revolution; Pastoralism; Repeat photography; Savanna ecology",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In such variable environments, the extent to which natural pastures can contribute to animal nutrition depends on how livestock are distributed with respect to forage resources in time and space. Animal movements are governed by the interactions of bio-physical, economic and institutional drivers and constraints, all of which are dynamic in time and space, making disentangling the relative importance of different drivers challenging. We examine a large migratory system in central Kazakhstan, using unique long-term data in the context of major socio-economic change, to explore the changing role of bio-physical variables in shaping livestock movement. We explore the determinants of livestock distributions across broad ecological zones in pre-Soviet, Soviet and current time-periods. Differences between zones were examined using Soviet literature, recent interviews with herders and satellite imagery. At the site level, we combined data on livestock locations and density for 2003 and 2012 with bio-physical data from remote sensing. Taken together, these data suggest that the importance of bio-physical variables in determining inter-zonal movements and their timing have decreased over time, whilst the significance of economic and institutional factors appears to have increased. Although resource density may still be a ""pull factor"" driving movement in some situations, there is evidence that ""push factors"" such as snow cover, presence of harmful insects and temperature combine with herd size to influence movements between zones, leading to a reduction in the matching between grazing distribution and forage resources. These changes reflect the move to livestock management by small household units owning highly variable numbers of animals. They are representative of global trends in pastoral systems, in which reduction in mobility is linked to declines in collective management institutions, increasing integration of pastoralists in the wider economy and land tenure change.",2016,"2019-06-28 18:04:43","2019-06-28T18:04:43Z",NA,"169–182","","","143",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Central Asia; Human-nature interaction; Livestock; Migration; Pasture",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For this purpose four levels of diversity are considered: genes, species, ecosystems and functions. Different perspectives on biodiversity value can be characterized through a number of factors: instrumental vs. intrinsic values, local vs. global diversity, life diversity vs. biological resources, etc. A classification of biodiversity values is offered, based on a system of logical relationships among biodiversity, ecosystems, species and human welfare. Suggestions are made about which economic valuation methods can address which type of biodiversity value. The resulting framework is the starting point for a survey and evaluation of empirical studies at each of the four levels of diversity. The contingent valuation method is by far the most used method. An important reason is that the other valuation methods are unable to identify and measure passive or nonuse values of biodiversity. At first sight, the resulting monetary value estimates seem to give unequivocal support to the belief that biodiversity has a significant, positive social value. Nevertheless, most studies lack a uniform, clear perspective on biodiversity as a distinct concept from biological resources. In fact, the empirical literature fails to apply economic valuation to the entire range of biodiversity benefits. Therefore, available economic valuation estimates should generally be regarded as providing a very incomplete perspective on, and at best lower bounds, to the unknown value of biodiversity changes.",2001,"2019-06-28 18:04:41","2019-06-28T18:04:41Z",NA,"203–222","","2","39",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Biological resource; Life diversity; Monetary valuation",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The key questions addressed herein are: (1) what is the role of irrigation development and management in poverty alleviation? (2) what are the linkages and pathways through which irrigation contributes to poverty alleviation? (3) what is the magnitude of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? and (4) what are key determinants of anti-poverty impacts of irrigation? Our review focuses on topical empirical research studies in Asia. The extensive review suggests that there are strong linkages between irrigation and poverty. These linkages are both direct and indirect. Direct linkages operate via localized and household-level effects, and indirect linkages operate via aggregate or subnational and national level impacts. Irrigation benefits the poor though higher production, higher yields, lower risk of crop failure, and higher and year-round farm and nonfarm employment. Irrigation enables smallholders to adopt more diversified cropping patterns, and to switch from low-value subsistence production to high-value market-oriented production. Increased production makes food available and affordable for the poor. The indirect linkages operate via regional, national, and economy-wide effects. Irrigation investments act as production and supply shifters, and have a strong positive effect on growth, benefiting the poor in the long run. Further, irrigation benefits also accrue to the poor and landless in the long run, although in the short run relative benefits to the landless and land-poor may be small, as the allocation of water often tends to be land-based. Despite that, the poor and landless benefit, in both absolute and relative terms, from irrigation investments. Recent advances in irrigation technologies, such as micro-irrigation systems, have strong anti-poverty potential. Ongoing studies in Asian countries document strong evidence that irrigation helps to alleviate both permanent and temporary poverty. Further, it helps to alleviate poverty in its worst forms, namely chronic poverty. In general, irrigation is productivity enhancing, growth promoting, and poverty reducing. Instances of negative externality effects associated with large and medium-scale irrigation systems point to management issues, and therefore call for more comprehensive response mechanisms from the planning and the political community alike. The anti- poverty impacts of irrigation can be intensified by creating conditions or enabling environments that could achieve functional inclusion of the poor. These include: (1) equitable access to land; (2) integrated water resource management; (3) access to and adequacy of good quality surface and groundwater; (4) modern production technology, (5) shift to high-value market-oriented production; and (6) opportunities for the sale of farm outputs at low transaction costs. The benefits of irrigation to the poor can be intensified by initiating broader level and targeted interventions simultaneously.",2004,"2019-06-28 18:04:38","2019-06-28T18:04:38Z",NA,"1–15","","October 2003","15",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Asia; India; Pakistan; Sri Lanka; agriculture; chronic poverty; irrigation; pro-poor interventions; transient poverty",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These effects influence local biodiversity that can be tracked through genetic and genomic approaches. Metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches provide a way of monitoring some types of communities under climate change for the appearance of invasives. Introgression and hybridization can be followed by the analysis of entire genomes so that rapidly changing areas of the genome are identified and instances of genetic pollution monitored. Genomic markers enable accurate tracking of invasive species' geographic origin well beyond what was previously possible. New genomic tools are promoting fresh insights into classic questions about invading organisms under climate change, such as the role of genetic variation, local adaptation and climate pre-adaptation in successful invasions.

Largement empirique, la mise en place de ces mesures n'a, à ce jour, pas fait l'objet d'un suivi en termes de réduction des flux éoliens et de restauration des sols et de la végétation. Le but de ce travail était dès lors d'évaluer l'efficacité d'une barrière physique antiérosive sur les flux de sédiments éoliens, la fertilité du sol et la couverture herbacée naturelle. Le dispositif expérimental, long de 200 m et large de 40 m est installé sur une dune vive et mis en défens. Il est subdivisé en 40 parcelles de 20 m x 10 m de large délimitées par des palissades de Leptadenia pyrotechnica. Les mesures de flux de sédiments ont été effectuées durant la période d'harmattan en 2005, 2006 et 2007 à l'aide de capteurs de sédiments de type MWAC alignés selon 8 transects orientés parallèlement aux vents dominants. Un suivi spatiotemporel a permis d'évaluer l'impact qualitatif et quantitatif du brise-vent, la fertilité du sol et la végétation herbacée. En 2007, l'essentiel des flux de sédiment s'est produit entre mi-février et mi-mars. En 2005, la première palissade a réduit de plus de 98 % les flux éoliens sur une distance de 10 fois sa hauteur. L'efficacité observée en 2006 et 2007 était pratiquement de 100 %. Cette efficacité accrue est attribuable au retour des herbacées au sein de la zone mise en défens. L'efficacité des palissades antiérosives se traduit par des dépôts de sédiments pouvant atteindre 9 cm d'épaisseur en un an à 1 m au vent de palissades.

We use an agent-based model to analyze different spatial metrics and their implications on land use decisions in a dynamic cost environment. The model contains a number of alternative submodels which differ in incentive design and social interactions of agents, the latter including coordinating as well as cooperating behavior of agents.

Our knowledge is patchy among and within higher taxonomic groups; we are still largely gathering case studies. Second, taxonomic groups vary considerably in which proximate factors are most important. Third, several groups show differing responses within different ecoregions. Whether these differences are consistent across groups requires further testing. Fourth, related species often have divergent reactions to disturbance, even within lower taxonomic groupings (families or genera). Thus, we cannot rely on phylogenetic relatedness or even ecological similarity to infer similarity in responses. Finally, disturbance typically reduces species diversity (especially of native and/or endemic species), but also causes species turnover, typically with forest specialists replaced by grassland generalists, and endemics replaced by non-endemics (including invasives). Given these knowledge gaps, we stress the urgency of applied studies that assess species' ecology, behaviour and health across disturbance gradients, including purely anthropogenic landscapes. Remaining natural vegetation and protected areas will be unable to preserve Madagascar's biodiversity under the impact of climatic change; we must understand responses of plants and animals to disturbance in order to create buffer zones and corridors combining secondary, degraded and natural habitats. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010,"2019-06-28 18:04:28","2019-06-28T18:04:28Z",NA,"2351–2362","","10","143",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Amphibians; Birds; Fish; Habitat disturbance; Habitat fragmentation; Insects; Madagascar; Mammals; Plants; Reptiles",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One way that biodiversity loss threatens human health is by exacerbating risk and incidence of infectious diseases. This paper briefly reviews two zoonotic diseases–West Nile virus (WNV) illness and Lyme disease (LD)–in which high diversity in the community of vertebrate hosts for arthropod vectors strongly reduces human risk. In both cases, the primary reservoirs for the pathogen are species that dominate in human-impacted, low-diversity communities. As a result, the generalist vectors responsible for transmitting the pathogens to humans have relatively high feeding rates on these reservoirs, leading to high infection prevalence in mosquito (for WNV) and tick (for LD) vectors. In contrast, where native vertebrate diversity is high, mosquito and tick vectors evidently feed from a wider variety of hosts, most of which are poor reservoirs for the pathogens, resulting in lower infection prevalence. Protection of humans against exposure to zoonotic pathogens should be added to the list of utilitarian functions provided by high biodiversity.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:04:26","2019-06-28T18:04:26Z",NA,"40–43","","SUPPL. 1","15",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19220353",NA,NA,NA,"Dilution effect; Ecosystem services; Emerging infectious diseases; Lyme disease; West Nile virus",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Anthropogenic global change has broadly increased a wide variety of processes that can drive regime shifts. To assess the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to such shifts and their potential consequences, we reviewed the scientific literature for 13 types of marine regime shifts and used networks to conduct an analysis of co-occurrence of drivers and ecosystem service impacts. We found that regime shifts are caused by multiple drivers and have multiple consequences that co-occur in a non-random pattern. Drivers related to food production, climate change and coastal development are the most common co-occurring causes of regime shifts, while cultural services, biodiversity and primary production are the most common cluster of ecosystem services affected. These clusters prioritize sets of drivers for management and highlight the need for coordinated actions across multiple drivers and scales to reduce the risk of marine regime shifts. Managerial strategies are likely to fail if they only address well-understood or data-rich variables, and international cooperation and polycentric institutions will be critical to implement and coordinate action across the scales at which different drivers operate. By better understanding these underlying patterns, we hope to inform the development of managerial strategies to reduce the risk of high-impact marine regime shifts, especially for areas of the world where data are not available or monitoring programmes are not in place.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:04:23","2019-06-28T18:04:23Z",NA,"20130273–20130273","","1659","370",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"ecology; environmental science",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Over the past 30. years rapid land use change in this area has substantially reduced wildlife habitat. Tsetse control operations are often blamed for this. In this study, we quantify this change for the Dande Communal Area, Mbire District, of the Mid-Zambezi Valley and analyse the contribution of three major potential drivers: (1) increase in human population; (2) increase in cattle population (and the expansion of associated plough-based agriculture), and; (3) expansion of cotton farming. Although direct effects of land use change on wildlife densities could not be proven, our study suggests that the consequences for elephant and buffalo numbers are negative. All three of the above drivers have contributed to the observed land use change. However, we found farmland to have expanded faster than the human population, and to have followed a similar rate of expansion in cattle sparse, tsetse infested areas as in tsetse free areas where cattle-drawn plough agriculture dominates. This implies the existence of a paramount driver, which we demonstrate to be cotton farming. Contrary to common belief, we argue that tsetse control was not the major trigger behind the dramatic land use change observed, but merely alleviated a constraint to cattle accumulation. We argue that without the presence of a cash crop (cotton), land use change would have been neither as extensive nor as rapid as has been observed. Therefore, conservation agencies should be as concerned by the way people farm as they are by population increase. Conserving biodiversity without jeopardising agricultural production will require the development of innovative technological and institutional options in association with policy and market interventions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:04:21","2019-06-28T18:04:21Z",NA,"1481–1493","","5","144",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agricultural frontier; Cotton; Livelihood; Tsetse fly; Wildlife; Zimbabwe",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study explicitly determines trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and livestock grazing intensity on rangelands. Grazing intensity and its effects on forage utilization by livestock, carbon sequestration, erosion prevention and biodiversity are quantified and mapped, using global datasets and models. Results show that on average 4% of the biomass produced annually is consumed by livestock. On average, erosion prevention is 10% lower in areas with a high grazing intensity compared to areas with a low grazing intensity, whereas carbon emissions are more than four times higher under high grazing intensity compared to low grazing intensity. Rangelands with the highest grazing intensity are located in the Sahel, Pakistan, West India, Middle East, North Africa and parts of Brazil. These high grazing intensities result in carbon emissions, low biodiversity values, low capacity for erosion prevention and unsustainable forage utilization.

That is, a significant proportion of individuals refuse to make trade-offs which require the substitution of biodiversity for other goods.

This study evaluates different land management scenarios in terms of ecosystem services in a South African rangeland, the Baviaanskloof catchment. As measured data were limited, we used simple models to quantify and map the effect of the different combination of agricultural, nature conservation and restoration practices on multiple ecosystem services. The land management scenarios were evaluated against management targets set for individual ecosystem services. Results highlight how the provision of ecosystem services is related to land management as unmanaged, pristine ecosystems provide a different mix of ecosystem services than ecosystems recently restored or managed as grazing lands. Results also indicate that historically overgrazed lands provide no forage, may retain 40% less sediment and have 38% lower biodiversity, while providing 60% more fuel wood and supplying two and half times more water (i.e. retaining less water), than pristine or restored lands. We conclude that a combination of light grazing, low input agriculture, nature conservation and restoration is the best for the sufficient provision of multiple ecosystem services. Applying such mixed management would improve biodiversity, ecotourism and maintain forage production and regulating services on farmers' land.

These changes are associated with deforestation, biodiversity loss and land degradation. A synthesis of results of long term research by an interdisciplinary team reveals the linkages between land use change, biodiversity loss and land degradation. The results indicate that as native vegetation is lost, indigenous plant and animal biodiversity and plant cover are lost. Pastoralism maintains native plant and animal species more effectively than crop cultivation. As croplands expand, soil fertility and moisture drops and soils erode more easily. Farmers who grow many crops conserve native plant species better than those who grow only one crop. Increased crop diversity encourages regeneration of indigenous plant species. Moderate farming as in the less intensive low input rainfed mixed crop farming, in less forested areas increases tree cover thus increasing the biodiversity. Farmers' who combine livestock rearing with cropping, use livestock manure to replenish soil nutrients in their farms and are thus able to maintain higher productivity. Farming in grasslands, woodlands and bushland areas where there are fewer trees, increases the diversity of habitats due to introduction of agrosystems that attract new species of birds. However, if the farming is intensified and the diversity of habitats is reduced biodiversity is also reduced.

ECGS Cahiers Bleus—26th ECGS Workshop on Active Volcanism & Continental Rifting, with special focus on the Virunga (North Kivu, DR of Congo)","","","","","During the January 2002 eruption at Nyiragongo volcano (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a NS-oriented fracture system of about 15 km long opened in the southern flank of the volcanic apparatus and several lava flows were emitted. Since May 2002, volcanic activity resumed in the main edifice (ca. 1.3 km in diameter), forming in the western part of the crater a lava lake that is still active nowadays. From this period a huge and visible plume, up to two km high, is releasing in the atmosphere up to 60,000 ton/day of SO2. The prevailing winds, mainly oriented to the W and SW, usually displace the plume for several hundreds of kilometers, carrying solid (volcanic ash, lapilli, Pelee's hairs) material and causing acidic rains that affect the equatorial forest, the crops and the villages in the surrounding of the volcano, where about 50,000 people are living. The consequences of the dispersion of the volcanic plume in the atmosphere pose severe problems in terms of water supply, since these populations only rely in the meteoric water. Rain water samples, discontinuously collected at the crater rim from 2002 to 2007, are characterized by pH values as low as 2 and high F- (up to 2,400 mg/L), Cl- (up to 1,750 mg/L) and SO4 2- (up to 10,000 mg/L) contents, unequivocally related to the interaction with the volcanic plume. Both pH and salinity values tend to be re-established to those typical of meteoric waters to the West, but unfortunately in the villages of Rusayo and Mudja, at about 10 km from the crater summit, low pH values and relatively high contents of F- were occasionally recorded. Although the future volcanic activity of Nyiragongo volcano is by far to be assessed, the activity of the lava lake at the Nyiragongo may be long-lasting and water resources and crops in the villages located",2008,"2019-06-28 18:03:49","2019-06-28T18:03:49Z",NA,"97–105",NA,"January",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Nyiragongo volcano – Democratic Republic of Congo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a non-linear optimisation procedure, land use is allocated at farm level, taking into account risk behaviour, and spatial as well as temporal variability of net revenues of land-use alternatives, using a spatial resolution of 29&#xa0;m&#xa0;Ã—&#xa0;29&#xa0;m. The model is applied to a study area of 30&#xa0;km&#xa0;Ã—&#xa0;34&#xa0;km in western Ecuador, considered a hotspot for biodiversity. In this coffee growing region, agroforestry systems with shade-coffee are important for biodiversity conservation at the landscape level, but under pressure due to low revenues. Through scenario analyses, we analyse the effects of price premiums per kg, payments per ha, and price buffering for coffee, as well as incentives leading to coffee yield increases, and payments per ha of forest remnants. We compare different risk aversion levels of the involved agents. We conclude that payments per ha are more efficient to maintain or increase coffee areas than payments per kg. Price buffering may be the most cost-effective way to support coffee production, especially at high-risk aversion levels. Significant yield increases are necessary to make coffee more attractive compared to the other alternatives. Relatively low payments per ha of forest can significantly increase forested land. Risk behaviour turns out to be an important factor when determining the possible effect of payments for ecosystem services.

One way in which to examine these processes is to study the secondary effects of predator removal on communities. This study examined the role of predatory fishes in structuring communities of coral reef fishes, by using a network of marine reserves (the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) as a natural experiment. We hypothesized that reefs with high densities of piscivores (marine reserves) would have distinct fish communities from those where piscivores have been depleted through fishing, due to variation in predation pressure.We predicted that predator depletion would result in ‘‘prey release”, and a corresponding increase in prey densities along a gradient of fishing intensity, causing a change in the community composition of reef fishes. To address this, fish counts and habitat surveys were conducted at four locations on the Great Barrier Reef. At each location, comparisons were made amongst three marine park zones that varied in their exposure to fishing practices; no- take marine reserves, limited fishing areas, and open fishing areas. The density and biomass of predators varied consistently among zones at each location. Furthermore, we found strong evidence for prey release at all four locations, resulting in distinct fish assemblages amongst zones. Reefs open to fishing had much lower densities of piscivores, and higher densities of prey and herbivorous fishes compared to marine reserves. This broad pattern was consistent amongst locations, and persisted at the level of species, trophic groups, families and communities. Habitat characteristics did not vary significantly amongst zones in a consistent manner amongst locations. Although habitat relationships were strong for specialist species such as butterflyfishes, densities of predators were stronger predictors of prey density for most species, and the trophic composition of reef fish communities differed significantly amongst zones at all locations. Results from this study support the concept that top-down effects can be strong divers of prey populations and influence community structure in highly diverse systems. These data emphasize the vital role of predators, and reinforce the importance of preserving and restoring top-down trophic interactions in ecological systems.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:03:33","2019-06-28T18:03:33Z",NA,"1–33",NA,"April",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"barrier reef; commercial fishing; conservation and management; coral reef fisheries; coral trout; fishing impacts; great; marine reserves; natural experiment; predator-prey interactions; recreational fishing; top-down effects",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Differing characteristics of urban areas can be conceptualised and subsequently mapped through the idea of urban morphology types (UMTs) - classifications which combine facets of urban form and function. When mapped, UMT units provide biophysically relevant meso-scale geographical zones which can be used as the basis for understanding climate-related impacts and adaptations. For example, they support the assessment of urban temperature patterns and the temperature regulation services provided by urban green structures. UMTs have been used for assessing regulating ecosystem services in European cities but little similar knowledge is available in an African context. This paper outlines the concept of UMTs and how they were applied to two African case study cities: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It then presents the data and methods used to understand provision of temperature regulation services across the two cities. In total, 35 detailed UMT classes were identified for Addis Ababa and 43 for Dar es Salaam. Modelled land surface temperature profiles for each of these UMTs are presented. The results demonstrate that urban morphological characteristics of UMTs, such as land surface cover proportions and associated built mass, have a much larger potential to alter neighbourhood level surface temperatures compared to projected climate changes. Land surface cover differences drive land surface temperature ranges over 25 ??C compared to climate change projections being associated with changes of less than 1.5 ??C. Residential UMTs account for the largest surface area of the cities, which are rapidly expanding due to population increase. Within the Residential UMTs, informal settlements and traditional housing areas are associated with the lowest land surface temperatures in Addis Ababa. These have higher proportions and better composition of green structures than other residential areas. The results have implications for planning policies in the cities. In Addis Ababa, the current urban renewal strategy to convert high density informal unplanned settlements into formal planned housing needs to explicitly account for green structure provision to avoid adverse effects on future supply of temperature regulation services. In Dar es Salaam, condominium UMTs have some of the largest proportions of green structures, and the best provision of temperature regulation services. In this case the challenge will be to maintain these into the future. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:03:33","2019-06-28T18:03:33Z",NA,"43–57",NA,"",42,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Cities; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Land surface cover; Land surface temperature; Urban ecosystems; Urban morphology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Climate change, land use, and transport vectors interact in complex ways to determine the spread of native and non-native invasive species, pathogens, and their effects on ecosystem dynamics. Early detection and in-depth understanding of invasive species and infectious diseases will require an integrated network of research platforms and information exchange to identify hotspots of invasion or disease emergence. Partnerships with state and federal agencies that monitor the spread and impacts of invasive species and pathogens will be critical in developing a national data and research network that can facilitate a full understanding of the resulting effects on ecosystems and society. Citizen science can also play a role; individuals can report new invasions, record phenological changes associated with invasions or disease outbreaks, and can participate in efforts such as the Breeding Bird Survey, which may reveal long-term biotic change following species invasions and disease spread. The ecological and societal impacts of invasive species and pathogens differ across gradients of climate and land use, and in the presence of global climate change may exacerbate both their propagation and impacts.

We used data on the current and potential future distribution of 56 invasive alien plant species to estimate their impact on four services (surface water runoff, groundwater recharge, livestock production and biodiversity) in five terrestrial biomes. The estimated reductions in surface water runoff as a result of current invasions were \textgreater3000 million m3 (about 7% of the national total), most of which is from the fynbos (shrubland) and grassland biomes; the potential reductions would be more than eight times greater if invasive alien plants were to occupy the full extent of their potential range. Impacts on groundwater recharge would be less severe, potentially amounting to approximately 1.5% of the estimated maximum reductions in surface water runoff. Reductions in grazing capacity as a result of current levels of invasion amounted to just over 1% of the potential number of livestock that could be supported. However, future impacts could increase to 71%. A 'biodiversity intactness index' (the remaining proportion of pre-modern populations) ranged from 89% to 71% for the five biomes. With the exception of the fynbos biome, current invasions have almost no impact on biodiversity intactness. Under future levels of invasion, however, these intactness values decrease to around 30% for the savanna, fynbos and grassland biomes, but to even lower values (13% and 4%) for the two karoo biomes. Thus, while the current impacts of invasive alien plants are relatively low (with the exception of those on surface water runoff), the future impacts could be very high. While the errors in these estimates are likely to be substantial, the predicted impacts are sufficiently large to suggest that there is serious cause for concern. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Trading the service of conservation requires one to define a metric that determines the extent to which a conserved site adds to the regional conservation objective. Yet, while markets for conservation are widely discussed and increasingly applied, little research has been conducted on explicitly accounting for spatial ecological processes in the trading. In this paper, we use a coupled ecologicalâ€“economic simulation model to examine how spatial connectivity may be considered in the financial incentives created by a market-based conservation scheme. Land use decisions, driven by changing conservation costs and the conservation market, are simulated by an agent-based model of land users. On top of that, a metapopulation model evaluates the conservational success of the market. We find that optimal spatial incentives for agents correlate with species characteristics such as the dispersal distance, but they also depend on the spatio-temporal distribution of conservation costs. We conclude that a combined analysis of ecological and socio-economic conditions should be applied when designing market instruments to protect biodiversity.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:03:15","2019-06-28T18:03:15Z",NA,"779–788",NA,"4",142,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation; Ecologicalâ€“economic modelling; Market-based instruments; Payments; Spatial incentives; Tradable permits",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

High-throughput whole-genome RNA sequencing experiments revealed a set of molecular processes that were affected by the activity of the longevity circuit, thereby identifying new candidate cell-nonautonomous aging mechanisms.

The additional stresses imposed by climate change in the coming years will require extraordinary adaptation. We need to track the changing status of ecosystems, deepen our understanding of the biological underpinnings for ecosystem service delivery and develop new tools and techniques for maintaining and restoring resilient biological and social systems. We will be building on an ecosystem foundation that has been radically compromised during the past half century. Most rivers have been totally restructured, oceans have been severely altered and depleted, coral reefs are near the tipping point of disappearing as functional ecosystems, over half of the land surface is devoted to livestock and crop agriculture, with little consideration for the ecosystem services that are being lost as a consequence, some irrevocably so. We have already seen many regime shifts, or tipping points, due to human activity, even before the onset of measurable climate change impacts on ecosystems. Climate change, caused mainly by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, will disrupt our ecosystem base in new ways. Already we are seeing widespread signs of change. Species behaviors are altering and disrupting mutualisms of long standing. We are seeing extinctions within vulnerable habitats and conditions where migrations are necessary for survival but where often there are no pathways available for successful movement in the fragmented world of today. These challenges represent an extraordinary threat to society and a call for urgent attention by the scientific community. ?? 2009.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:03:02","2019-06-28T18:03:02Z",NA,"46–54",NA,"1",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reconstructing historical changes in human-derived fire regimes empirically is challenging, but information is available on the timing of key human innovations and on current human impacts on fire; here we incorporate this knowledge into a spatially explicit fire propagation model. We explore how changes in population density, the ability to create fire, and the expansion of agropastoralism altered the extent and seasonal distribution of fire as modern humans arose and spread through Africa. Much emphasis has been placed on the positive effect of population density on ignition frequency, but our model suggests this is less important than changes in fire spread and connectivity that would have occurred as humans learned to light fires in the dry season and to transform the landscape through grazing and cultivation. Different landscapes show different limitations; we show that substantial human impacts on burned area would only have started ∼4,000 B.P. in open landscapes, whereas they could have altered fire regimes in closed/dissected landscapes by ∼40,000 B.P. Dry season fires have been the norm for the past 200-300 ky across all landscapes. The annual area burned in Africa probably peaked between 4 and 40 kya. These results agree with recent paleocarbon studies that suggest that the biomass burned today is less than in the recent past in subtropical countries.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:02:52","2019-06-28T18:02:52Z",NA,"847–852",NA,"27",109,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22184249",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Savanna; fire; human evolution; human ignition",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One hypothesis attributes this to sex differences in dispersal and in the variance of reproductive success. We tested this hypothesis by examining the coalescent dates of genetic markers within elephantid lineages, predicting that lower dispersal and lower variance in reproductive success among females would have increased mtDNA relative to nuclear coalescent dates. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two forest elephants, aligning them to mitogenomes of African savanna and Asian elephants, and of woolly mammoths, including the most divergent mitogenomes within each lineage. Using fossil calibrations, the divergence between African elephant F and S clade mitochondrial genomes (originating in forest and savanna elephant lineages, respectively) was estimated as 5.5 Ma. We estimated that the (African) ancestor of the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages diverged 6.0 Ma, indicating that four elephantid lineages had differentiated in Africa by the Miocene-Pliocene transition, concurrent with drier climates. The coalescent date for forest elephant mtDNAs was c. 2.4 Ma, suggesting that the decrease in tropical forest cover during the Pleistocene isolated distinct African forest elephant lineages. For all elephantid lineages, the ratio of mtDNA to nuclear coalescent dates was much greater than 0.25. This is consistent with the expectation that sex differences in dispersal and in variance of reproductive success would have increased the effective population size of mtDNA relative to nuclear markers in elephantids, contributing to the persistence of incongruent mtDNA phylogeographic patterns.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:02:48","2019-06-28T18:02:48Z",NA,"1175–1189",NA,"5",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22260276",NA,NA,NA,"Asian elephant; Proboscidea; coalescent; molecular clock; savanna elephant; woolly mammoth",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our analysis suggests that the basic presumption that fire is a main driver of vegetation dynamics in the savanna ecosystem by suppressing tree seedlings and encouraging grasses needs to be re-examined. An improved approach is to understand how fire may act both as a negative and positive feedback in different vegetational phases and both as a driver and responder in transitions between phases. The correlation between arboreal pollen (AP) percentages and charcoal influx suggests that in the grassland phase (\textless 5% AP), fire acts as a driver of woody recruitment and as a positive feedback, i.e. potentially driving the system to shift into a savanna phase. In the savanna phase (5-10% AP) fire limits woody recruitment and acts as a negative feedback in maintaining the savanna. Thus, in the savanna phase other factors than fire alone drive the transition from savanna to woodland-forest. In the riparian phase, where evidence of farming is present particularly from AD 1600 onwards, fire appears to facilitate tree recruitment where AP ranges between c. 10 and 20% AP. Though a decline in AP abundance can be seen contemporaneously with charcoal peaks, our analysis suggests that overall, human-induced fires do not seem to have a negative impact on woody cover. Our results have implications for fire management as riparian-dominated phases and savannas with a sufficient woody cover are less sensitive to changes in fire policies than open grasslands that may, with a change in fire frequency, change into another state.",2010,"2019-06-28 18:02:46","2019-06-28T18:02:46Z",NA,"1063–1077",NA,"7",20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"charcoal; environmental history; fire ecology; pollen; savanna",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The term includes changes in climate and climate variability, atmospheric composition, land use and land cover including deforestation and urbanisation, bio-geochemistry, globalisation of trade and transport, the spread of alien species, human health and technology. A subset of land use issues relates to the management of protective technologies in relation to residues in food and the environment and the emergence of resistance. Another is the question of changing biodiversity of both parasites and their associated natural enemies, and the effects on the host-parasite relationship and on parasite management. A framework for studying impacts of global change is proposed and illustrated with field data, and CLIMEX and simulation modelling of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus in Australia. Parasitology suffers from the perception that the key impacts of global change will be driven by changes at lower trophic levels, with parasitic interactions being treated as secondary effects. This is incorrect because the environment mediates host-parasite interactions as much as it affects parasites directly. Parasitologists need to strive for holistic solutions to the management of animal and human health, within a wider context of overall management of those systems, if they are to make a meaningful contribution to global efforts aimed at coping with global change. ?? 2001 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.",2001,"2019-06-28 18:02:46","2019-06-28T18:02:46Z",NA,"933–948","","9","31",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 11406142",NA,NA,NA,"Boophilus microplus; CLIMEX; Climatic change; DYMEX; Land use; Modular modelling; Parasite; Pesticide resistance; Quarantine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Location South African Cape Floristic Region. Methods We use data-driven demographic models to assess the impacts of past habitat loss and future climate change on range size, range filing and abundances of eight species of woody plants (Proteaceae). The species-specific models employ a hybrid approach that simulates population dynamics and long-distance dispersal on top of expected spatio-temporal dynamics of suitable habitat. Results Climate change was mainly predicted to reduce range size and range filling (because of a combination of strong habitat shifts with low migration ability). In contrast, habitat loss mostly decreased mean local abundance. For most species and response measures, the combination of habitat loss and climate change had the most severe effect. Yet, this combined effect was mostly smaller than expected from adding or multiplying effects of the individual environmental drivers. This seems to be because climate change shifts suitable habitats to regions less affected by habitat loss. Interspecific variation in range size responses depended mostly on the severity of environmental change, whereas responses in range filling and local abundance depended mostly on demographic properties of species. While most surviving populations concentrated in areas that remain climatically suitable, refugia for multiple species were overestimated by simply overlying habitat models and ignoring demography. Main conclusions Demographic models of range dynamics can simultaneously predict the response of range size, abundance and range filling to multiple drivers of environmental change. Demographic knowledge is particularly needed to predict abundance responses and to identify areas that can serve as biodiversity refugia under climate change.

The study has revealed that the country losses 150,433 ha of forest per year. Due to increase in population by year 2030 almost 2.8 million ha of forests will have been lost.

The long dry season, the weak vegetation cover, the prevalence of sandy soils and the occurrence of strong erosive winds at critical times favour this process. Whereas aeolian processes have been extensively studied in cultivated fields, mostly in Western Niger, little information exists regarding areas covered by natural vegetation such as grazing lands. Hence, a study was carried out in order to assess aeolian fluxes on a dune pasture in Tchago (Eastern Niger, North-West of Gouré) during several months in 2004, 2005 and 2006. In addition, continuous monitoring of wind characteristics and threshold wind velocity for saltation between July 2004 and June 2007 permitted to estimate aeolian fluxes on a daily basis all along the year using the model of LETTAU and LETTAU (1978). Sediment fluxes measured during convective storms ranged between 1,1 ± 1,3 and 78,9 ± 45,2 kg/m. The fluxes estimated by the model of LETTAU and LETTAU were in agreement with the measured fluxes. However, measured fluxes may overestimate the equilibrium fluxes because of the nearby presence of a deflation area. According to the LETTAU and LETTAU model, aeolian fluxes follow seasonal dynamics due in part to variations in wind velocity but mostly due to changes in the aerodynamic roughness length (Z0 ). The latter reflects the vegetation cover and varies between 5 10-2 m for 3,2 ±0,8 T/ha of dry matter when the vegetation is most developed (mid-August - September) up to a minimum of 10-4 m for 0,25 ±0,03 T/ha at the time when the ground is least covered (from April till the start of the rainy season). No seasonal dynamics were observed in a fenced-off area. An exponential relation was found between vegetation dry matter and Z0 . This relation is specific to the type of vegetation found on the dune, dominated by Cenchrus biflorus. The threshold friction velocity was linearly related to Z0 and varies between 0.26 and 0.49 m/s for Z0 values of 1 10-4 and 1.5 10-3 m, respectively. For the critical periods of wind erosion (end of dry season and first half of the rain season), threshold wind speed at 2 m height is less than 7 m/s, which is frequently exceeded during convective storms. Results show that large aeolian fluxes may occur on Sahelian rangeland during the dry season, grazing and gathering of biomass by the local population most likely being the main causes.",2011,"2019-06-28 18:02:37","2019-06-28T18:02:37Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Résumé:; aerodynamic roughness length; fenced-off area; friction velocity; model; rangeland.; sediment flux; wind erosion",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rb in both liver and muscle tissue and Zn in muscle tissue were also found to biomagnify through this food web, although at a rate that is approximately 25% of that of THg. A number of elements (Cd, Pb and Ni in muscle tissue and Cd and Li in seabird liver tissue) were found to decrease trophically through the food web, as indicated by significantly negative relationships with tissue-specific ??15N. A diverse group of metals (Ag, Ba, La, Li, Sb, Sr, U and V) were found to have higher concentrations in zooplankton than seabirds or marine mammals due to bioconcentration from seawater. The remaining metals (As, Co, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo and Se in muscle tissue) showed no relationship with trophic position, as indicated by ??15N values, although As in liver tissue showed significant biomagnification in the seabird portion of the food web.",2005,"2019-06-28 18:02:36","2019-06-28T18:02:36Z",NA,"247–263","","","351-352",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 16061271",NA,NA,NA,"Arctic; Biodilution; Biomagnification; Mercury; Metals; Methyl mercury; Seabirds; Stable nitrogen isotopes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:02:34","2019-06-28T18:02:34Z",NA,"699–714","","4","78",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19298616",NA,NA,NA,"Apex predator; Indirect effects of fishing; Macro-ecology; Meta-analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The additional stresses imposed by climate change in the coming years will require extraordinary adaptation. We need to track the changing status of ecosystems, deepen our understanding of the biological underpinnings for ecosystem service delivery and develop new tools and techniques for maintaining and restoring resilient biological and social systems. We will be building on an ecosystem foundation that has been radically compromised during the past half century. Most rivers have been totally restructured, oceans have been severely altered and depleted, coral reefs are near the tipping point of disappearing as functional ecosystems, over half of the land surface is devoted to livestock and crop agriculture, with little consideration for the ecosystem services that are being lost as a consequence, some irrevocably so. We have already seen many regime shifts, or tipping points, due to human activity, even before the onset of measurable climate change impacts on ecosystems. Climate change, caused mainly by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, will disrupt our ecosystem base in new ways. Already we are seeing widespread signs of change. Species behaviors are altering and disrupting mutualisms of long standing. We are seeing extinctions within vulnerable habitats and conditions where migrations are necessary for survival but where often there are no pathways available for successful movement in the fragmented world of today.

One way that biodiversity loss threatens human health is by exacerbating risk and incidence of infectious diseases. This paper briefly reviews two zoonotic diseases–West Nile virus (WNV) illness and Lyme disease (LD)–in which high diversity in the community of vertebrate hosts for arthropod vectors strongly reduces human risk. In both cases, the primary reservoirs for the pathogen are species that dominate in human-impacted, low-diversity communities. As a result, the generalist vectors responsible for transmitting the pathogens to humans have relatively high feeding rates on these reservoirs, leading to high infection prevalence in mosquito (for WNV) and tick (for LD) vectors. In contrast, where native vertebrate diversity is high, mosquito and tick vectors evidently feed from a wider variety of hosts, most of which are poor reservoirs for the pathogens, resulting in lower infection prevalence. Protection of humans against exposure to zoonotic pathogens should be added to the list of utilitarian functions provided by high biodiversity.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:02:24","2019-06-28T18:02:24Z",NA,"40–43","","SUPPL. 1","15",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19220353",NA,NA,NA,"Dilution effect; Ecosystem services; Emerging infectious diseases; Lyme disease; West Nile virus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecosystem services are defined as the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems. Employing the ecosystem service concept is intended to support the development of policies and instruments that integrate social, economic and ecological perspectives. In recent years, this concept has become the paradigm of ecosystem management. 2. The prolific use of the term 'ecosystem services' in scientific studies has given rise to concerns about its arbitrary application. A quantitative review of recent literature shows the diversity of approaches and uncovers a lack of consistent methodology. 3. From this analysis, we have derived four facets that characterise the holistic ideal of ecosystem services research: (i) biophysical realism of ecosystem data and models; (ii) consideration of local trade-offs; (iii) recognition of off-site effects; and (iv) comprehensive but critical involvement of stakeholders within assessment studies. 4. These four facets should be taken as a methodological blueprint for further development and discussion. They should critically reveal and elucidate what may often appear to be ad-hoc approaches to ecosystem service assessments. 5.

Human actions frequently trigger fast evolutionary responses, affect extant genetic variation and result in the establishment of new communities and co-evolutionary networks for which we lack past analogues. Contemporary evolution interplays with ecological changes to determine the response of organisms and ecosystems to anthropogenic pressures. Examples on wild species include responses to harvest (e.g. fisheries, hunting, angling), habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. genetic effects of isolation), biotic exchange (e.g. evolutionary responses to control measures), climate change (e.g. local adaptation and its interplay with dispersal processes) and the responses of endangered species to conservation measures. A review of international and EU biodiversity policies showed numerous opportunities for the integration of evolutionary knowledge, with the realistic prospect of improving their efficacy. Such opportunities should be extended to other sectoral policies of direct relevance for biodiversity notably nature conservation, fisheries, agriculture, water resources, spatial planning and climate change. These avenues for improvement are, however, challenged by the low level of enforcement of biodiversity policies, linked to the nonbinding nature of most biodiversity-policy documents, and the decreasing representation of biodiversity in EUs research policy.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:02:16","2019-06-28T18:02:16Z",NA,"202–218","","2","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25568042",NA,NA,NA,"Anthropogenic evolution; Biodiversity policy; Co-evolutionary networks; Global change",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To investigate the influence of large-scale circulation on local-scale precipitation, a full spatial–statistical description of precipitation occurrence and amount for Senegal is developed. These regression-type models have been built on the basis of daily records at 137 locations and were developed in two stages: (i) a baseline model describing the expected daily occurrence probability and precipitation amount as spatial fields from monsoon onset to offset, and (ii) the inclusion of weather types defined from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis 850-hPa winds and 925-hPa relative humidity es- tablishing the link to the synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation. During peak phase, the resulting types appear in two main cycles that can be linked to passing African easterly waves. The models allow the in- vestigation of the spatial response of precipitation occurrence and amount to a discrete set of preferred states of the atmospheric circulation. As such, they can be used for drought risk mapping and the downscaling of climate change projections. Necessary choices, such as filtering and scaling of the atmospheric data (as well as the number of weather types to be used), have been made on the basis of the precipitation models' performance instead of relying on external criteria. It could be demonstrated that the inclusion of the synoptic-scale weather types lead to skill on the local and daily scale. On the interannual scale, the models for precipitation occurrence and amount capture 26% and 38% of the interannual spatially averaged variability, corresponding to Pearson correlation coefficients of rO 5 0.52 and ri 5 0.65, respectively.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:02:13","2019-06-28T18:02:13Z",NA,"8189–8209","","20","26",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Along twelve papers, different frameworks, theoretical approaches and statistical tools are developed to show the state-of-the-art in ES assessment in developed and developing countries.

These forest fragments are an example of community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400. years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches? How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace's (1956) framework of 'cultural revitalization' and based on historical literature and palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization, recognizing strong linkages between the 'social' and the 'ecological' within the social-ecological system of sacred forest groves. This example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as a social-ecological intervention in forest management. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:02:10","2019-06-28T18:02:10Z",NA,"393–400","","","329",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Community-based management; Cultural revitalization; Forest fragments; India; Refugia; Sacred groves",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thirty-six sediment and eighteen fish samples were carried out during a period of 12 months from February 2003 to February 2004. Determination of PCBs and dioxins was carried out using a high resolution GC mass spectrometer. The results indicated that the PCB and PCDD/F mean concentrations in sediment samples ranged from 1461 to 2244 and from 240 to 775 pg g-1 dry wt basis, respectively. The mean concentration of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in fish samples were found to be in the range from 695 to 853 pg g-1 fresh wt for PCB congeners and from 27.7 to 121 pg g-1 lipid for total PCDD/Fs. Moreover, the concentrations of both PCBs and PCDD/Fs were found to be different at different locations along the River Nile. It could be concluded that the contamination of the River Nile is within the permissible limits set by the FDA and the Egyptian Standards for fish and shellfish. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The study developed a suite of indices to analyze land use change impacts on the status, change and spatial patterns of multiple ecosystem services. On a national scale, the results show a mix of increases in service (water yield, N retention and P retention in Ghana, and, N and P retention in Cote d'Ivoire), little change in services (sediment retention in Ghana and sediment retention and water yield in Cote d'Ivoire) and decreases in services (biodiversity and carbon storage in both countries) from 2000 to 2009.

Using public health priorities on climate change, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed six specific goals for increasing understanding of the interaction between climate and VBZDs and for improving capacity for predicting climate change effects on incidence and distribution of VBZDs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Climate change may affect the incidence of VBZDs through its effect on four principal characteristics of host and vector populations that relate to pathogen transmission to humans: geographic distribution, population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load in individual hosts and vectors. These mechanisms may interact with each other and with other factors such as anthropogenic disturbance to produce varying effects on pathogen transmission within host and vector populations and to humans. Because climate change effects on most VBZDs act through wildlife hosts and vectors, understanding these effects will require multidisciplinary teams to conduct and interpret ecosystem-based studies of VBZD pathogens in host and vector populations and to identify the hosts, vectors, and pathogens with the greatest potential to affect human populations under climate change scenarios.",2010,"2019-06-28 18:01:56","2019-06-28T18:01:56Z",NA,"1507–1514","","11","118",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 20576580",NA,NA,NA,"Anthropogenic disturbance; Climate change; Infectious diseases; Reservoir; Vector; Vector-borne disease; Wildlife; Zoonotic disease. environ health perspect 118:1507",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The results supported the hypothesis that variation in macrophyte community structure (measured as species composition and diversity) in southern tropical African river systems, using Zambia as a case study area, is driven primarily by geographical variation in water physico-chemical conditions. In total, 335 macrophyte taxa were recorded, and a chronological cumulative species records curve for the dataset showed no sign of asymptoting: clearly many additional macrophyte species remain to be found in Zambian rivers. Emergent macrophytes were predominant (236 taxa), together with 26 floating and 73 submerged taxa. Several species were rare in a regional or international context, including two IUCN Red Data List species: Aponogeton rehmanii and Nymphaea divaricata. Ordination and classification analysis of the data found little evidence for temporal change in vegetation, at repeatedly-sampled sites, but strong evidence for the existence of seven groups of samples from geographically-varied study sites. These supported differing sets of vegetation (with eight species assemblages present in the sample-groups) and showed substantial inter-group differences in both macrophyte alpha-diversity, and geographically-varying physico-chemical parameters. The evidence suggested that the main environmental drivers of macrophyte community composition and diversity were altitude, stream order, shade, pH, alkalinity, NO\textlessinf\textgreater3\textless/inf\textgreater-N, and underwater light availability, while PO\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater-P showed slightly lower, but still significant variation between sample-groups.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:01:54","2019-06-28T18:01:54Z",NA,"19–28","","","124",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Macrophyte diversity; River plants; Tropical river ecology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use a leading global environmental assessment model (IMAGE) to explore future land use and climate change in southern Africa under the scenarios developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We assess the impacts on terrestrial biodiversity using the Biodiversity Intactness Index, which gives the average change in population size relative to the pre-modern state, across all terrestrial species of plants and vertebrates. Over the coming century, we project absolute declines in the average population sizes of these taxa that are two to three times greater than the reductions that have occurred since circa 1700. Our results highlight the immense challenges faced by efforts to reduce rates of biodiversity loss in southern Africa, even under relatively optimistic scenarios. These results stress the urgent need for better aligning biodiversity conservation and development priorities in the region. Furthermore, we suggest that context-sensitive conservation targets that account for the development imperatives in different parts of the region are needed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is particularly significant to explore the impacts of government interventions on the management practices of local communities and on target social-ecological systems. The Inner Mongolian rangeland was traditionally managed by indigenous people using their own institutions that were adapted to the highly variable local climate and were able to maintain the resilience of the social-ecological system for more than 1000 years. However, external interventions have significantly affected the rangeland social-ecological system in recent decades. In this paper, using livestock breed improvement as an example, we track government interventions from the traditional era through the collective period to the present market economy period based on a review of historical documents and case studies. Using the concept of social-ecological system resilience, we diagnose the impacts of interventions on livestock breed management in the rangeland social-ecological system, and discuss how these interventions occur. We found that government interventions in livestock breeding have gradually decoupled the pastoral society from its supporting ecological system. During this process, external powers have increasingly displaced the local community in defining the nature of rangeland management. Power asymmetry and discourse have contributed to this displacement.",2012,"2019-06-28 18:01:43","2019-06-28T18:01:43Z",NA,"","","1","17",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Decoupling; Inner mongolia; Rangeland management; Resilience; Social-ecological system",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

From a preindustrial value of 270-275 ppm, atmospheric carbon dioxide had risen to about 310 ppm by 1950. Since then the human enterprise has experienced a remarkable explosion, the Great Acceleration, with significant consequences for Earth System functioning. Atmospheric CO2 concentration has risen from 310 to 380 ppm since 1950, with about half of the total rise since the preindustrial era occurring in just the last 30 years.

Despite legislation moderating the discharge of phosphorus from some wastewater treatment works since the 1980s, eutrophication of freshwater resources is now widespread. Two important consequences are blooms of cyanobacteria, carrying the threat of cyanotoxin contamination, and excessive growth of macrophytes, which clog water-supply structures and reduce the recreational value of aquatic resources. Eutrophication-management options include reduction of phosphorus in detergents, biomanipulation of the food web, accurate prediction of cyanobacterial growth cycles, and mechanical disturbance of the epilimnion. The implementation of adaptive management to deal with eutrophication would ensure the testing and application of the most appropriate methodology to each eutrophic water body.

One of the key barriers to adoption of such practices is the high upfront cost associated with SLM implementation, which are a disincentive to their practice by poor landowners.

The long dry season, the weak vegetation cover, the prevalence of sandy soils and the occurrence of strong erosive winds at critical times favour this process. Whereas aeolian processes have been extensively studied in cultivated fields, mostly in Western Niger, little information exists regarding areas covered by natural vegetation such as grazing lands. Hence, a study was carried out in order to assess aeolian fluxes on a dune pasture in Tchago (Eastern Niger, North-West of Gouré) during several months in 2004, 2005 and 2006. In addition, continuous monitoring of wind characteristics and threshold wind velocity for saltation between July 2004 and June 2007 permitted to estimate aeolian fluxes on a daily basis all along the year using the model of LETTAU and LETTAU (1978). Sediment fluxes measured during convective storms ranged between 1,1 ± 1,3 and 78,9 ± 45,2 kg/m. The fluxes estimated by the model of LETTAU and LETTAU were in agreement with the measured fluxes. However, measured fluxes may overestimate the equilibrium fluxes because of the nearby presence of a deflation area. According to the LETTAU and LETTAU model, aeolian fluxes follow seasonal dynamics due in part to variations in wind velocity but mostly due to changes in the aerodynamic roughness length (Z0 ). The latter reflects the vegetation cover and varies between 5 10-2 m for 3,2 ±0,8 T/ha of dry matter when the vegetation is most developed (mid-August - September) up to a minimum of 10-4 m for 0,25 ±0,03 T/ha at the time when the ground is least covered (from April till the start of the rainy season). No seasonal dynamics were observed in a fenced-off area. An exponential relation was found between vegetation dry matter and Z0 . This relation is specific to the type of vegetation found on the dune, dominated by Cenchrus biflorus. The threshold friction velocity was linearly related to Z0 and varies between 0.26 and 0.49 m/s for Z0 values of 1 10-4 and 1.5 10-3 m, respectively. For the critical periods of wind erosion (end of dry season and first half of the rain season), threshold wind speed at 2 m height is less than 7 m/s, which is frequently exceeded during convective storms. Results show that large aeolian fluxes may occur on Sahelian rangeland during the dry season, grazing and gathering of biomass by the local population most likely being the main causes.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:01:22","2019-06-28T18:01:22Z",NA,"39–56",NA,"",33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"aerodynamic roughness length; fenced-off area; friction velocity; model; rangeland; sediment flux; wind erosion",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We assess these changes in four broad land cover classes - forests, natural non-forest vegetation, agriculture and barren - by using high spatial resolution Earth observing satellites. Two sets of sample images, one 'historical' targeted at 1975 and a second 'recent' targeted at the year 2000, have been selected through a stratified random sampling technique over the study area, targeting a sampling rate of 1% in each of the strata. The results, presented at eco-region level and aggregated at sub-Saharan level, show a 57% increase in agriculture area at the expense of natural vegetation which has itself decreased by 21% over the period, with nearly 5 million hectares forest and non-forest natural vegetation lost per year. The impacts of these changes on the environment on one site and on the socio-economy on the other site are discussed and possible pressures on human well being are highlighted. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A sample of 121 households were monitored over a 16-month period, using a combination of participatory and quantitative survey techniques, to assess their wealth and their production, consumption and market sales of wild foods. Households varied in wealth but all could be considered subject to extreme poverty (income below US$1 per capita per day). Our analyses indicate that wild foods play a small role in household consumption but a major role in household income. Hence, over 90% of both bushmeat and fish production is sold at market. In addition, the value of wild foods increases in the ""lean season"" when agricultural production is low. We also find that the poorest households in this community are unable to capitalise on the most valuable wild foods, bushmeat and fish, as a source of food or cash income. We use an entitlements framework to explain the factors that determine such wealth-related variation between households, indicating that household use of wild foods is determined more by social and economic constraints than by resource abundance in this community. Nevertheless, our findings show that overall the small-scale commercialisation of wild foods provides a vital source of income for rural households living in extreme poverty. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Land-cover maps derived from satellite imagery provide useful tools for monitoring land-use and land-cover change. KwaZulu-Natal, a populous yet biodiversity-rich province in South Africa, is one of the first provinces to produce a set of three directly comparable land-cover maps (2005, 2008 and 2011). These maps were used to investigate systematic land-cover changes occurring in the province with a focus on biodiversity conservation. The Intensity Analysis framework was used for the analysis as this quantitative hierarchical method addresses shortcomings of other established land-cover change analyses. In only 6 years (2005–2011), a massive 7.6% of the natural habitat of the province was lost to anthropogenic transformation of the landscape. The major drivers of habitat loss were agriculture, timber plantations, the built environment, dams and mines. Categorical swapping formed a significant part of landscape change, including a return from anthropogenic categories to secondary vegetation, which we suggest should be tracked in analyses. Longer-term rates of habitat loss were determined using additional land-cover maps (1994, 2000). An average of 1.2% of the natural landscape has been transformed per annum since 1994. Apart from the direct loss of natural habitat, the anthropogenically transformed land covers all pose additional negative impacts for biodiversity remaining in these or surrounding areas. A target of no more than 50% of habitat loss should be adopted to adequately conserve biodiversity in the province. Our analysis provides the first provincial assessment of the rate of loss of natural habitat and may be used to fulfil incomplete criteria used in the identification of Threatened Terrestrial Ecosystems, and to report on the Convention on Biological Diversity targets on rates of natural habitat loss.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:01:06","2019-06-28T18:01:06Z",NA,"1–9",NA,"9",111,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"conservation planning; habitat; intensity analysis; legislation; loss; satellite imagery",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The clearest connection between biotic homogenization and infectious disease is the spread of nonindigenous vectors and pathogens. The loss of predators and hosts that dilute pathogen transmission can also increase the incidence of vectorborne illnesses.

The evidence also suggests that mega-fires are positive feedbacks to changing climates via carbon emissions, and will be responsible for large swings in water yield and quality from temperate forests at the regional scale.Two factors widely considered to have contributed to our current proximity to tipping points are changing climates and human management - the latter most obviously taking the form of allowing fuels to build up, either through policies of fire suppression or failure to implement sufficient fuel reduction fires - to the point where wildfire intensity increases dramatically. Much of the evidence comes from Australia and the USA, but domains such as Africa and the boreal north provide additional insights.Forests adapted to regimes of low-moderate intensity fires may not face the same challenges as the iconic ash forests of Australia and the coniferous forests of Yellowstone or the west coast of the USA that are adapted to high intensity fire. However the often modest physical barriers (including distance, topography and climate) between forests adapted to more frequent, low-moderate intensity fires on the one hand, and less frequent, high intensity fires on the other, are easily overcome by confluences of continually increasing fuel loads and changing climates that serve to increase both fire frequency and intensity.For temperate forests, we can mitigate the extent of large-scale, high intensity fires and their consequences if we carefully use fuel reduction fires and other standard forest management practises such as thinning. Mitigation will require assessing impacts on biodiversity of smaller, low-intensity fires at intervals of 5-10. years (to reduce fuels and mitigate fire size and intensity), against those of large-scale, high intensity wildfires at increasing (but unknown) frequency. Mitigation will require that forests be managed contiguously, not via different agencies with different objectives according to land tenure. Managing requires that governments and the communities they serve acknowledge the limitations of fire-suppression. Mitigating the incidence and effects of large-scale, high intensity fires through embracing the use of managed fire in conjunction with judicious use of fire suppression offers opportunity to avoid potentially large changes in vegetation and biomass (e.g. abundance of dominant species, biodiversity, fuel structure and loads), as well as in water yield and quality and carbon carrying capacity. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2013,"2019-06-28 18:00:56","2019-06-28T18:00:56Z",NA,"250–261",NA,"2013",294,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Australia; Bushfire; Forests; USA; Wildfire; Woodlands",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Of the physical properties discussed, large dilution capacities and long flushing times can make the detection and removal of chemical pollutants in these lakes difficult. The outflows of all three lakes are small because of high evaporation losses; and as a result lake levels are responsive to climate changes that would alter evaporation:precipitation ratios Increased nutrient input to these lakes will likely result in a decrease in the volume of oxygenated water and available fish habitat. Plankton community composition will also change, probably toward dominance by cyanobacteria While the effects of eutrophication on fish production are difficult to predict, changes in plankton composition would almost certainly be accompanied by changes in fish community structure. Recent studies of water chemistry and plankton productivity in Lake Victoria provide of possible eutrophication. Because land use has a diffuse but potentially large impact on these takes; conservation strategies must take into account human activities within entire drainage basins.

Dwindling numbers of species can eventually lead to their functional extinction. Functional, or ecological, extinction occurs when a species becomes too rare to fulfill its ecological, interactive role in the ecosystem, leading to true (numerical) extinction of other depending species. Recent theoretical work on food webs suggests that the frequency of functional extinction might be surprisingly high. However, little is known about the risk of functional species extinctions in networks with other types of interactions than trophic ones. Here, we explore the frequency of functional extinctions in model ecological networks having different proportions of antagonistic and mutualistic links. Furthermore, we investigate the topological relationship between functionally and numerically extinct species. We find that (1) the frequency of functional extinctions is higher in networks containing a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions than in networks with only one type of interaction, (2) increased mortality rate of species having both mutualistic and antagonistic links is more likely to lead to extinction of another species than to extinction of the species itself compared to species having only mutualistic or antagonistic links, and (3) trophic distance (shortest path) between functionally and numerically extinct species is, on average, longer than one, indicating the importance of indirect effects. These results generalize the findings of an earlier study on food webs, demonstrating the potential importance of functional extinction in a variety of ecological network types.",2015,"2019-06-28 18:00:51","2019-06-28T18:00:51Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1007/s12080-015-0275-7",NA,NA,NA,"Declining populations; Ecological network; Functional extinction; Interaction strength; Interaction type",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Their decline has been linked to secondary extinctions and their increase has been linked to ecological restoration. Several authors have recently argued that the dingo Canis lupus dingo is another example of a top predator that maintains mesopredators and generalist herbivores at low and stable numbers, thereby increasing biodiversity and productivity. Due to the sensitivity of many Australian species to introduced mesopredators and herbivores, the top predator hypothesis predicts that threatened species will not survive where dingoes are rare or absent. However, several threatened species have survived inside the Dingo Barrier Fence (DBF). We present a new view on the survival of the yellow-footed rock-wallaby Petrogale xanthopus xanthopus and the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata inside the DBF where the dingo is considered very rare, or in areas where the dingo is believed to have been eradicated several decades ago. We found that dingoes co-occurred with both threatened species. Dingoes were present at all wallaby colonies surveyed and occurred throughout their range. The most common predator detected in areas inhabited by the wallabies was in fact the dingo, and we found no significant difference between dingo abundance inside compared to outside the DBF. Malleefowl nests were found to be scent marked by dingoes at the three sites that we surveyed, despite these sites being close to human settlement and sheep farms, and in small and fragmented patches of wilderness. These findings provide further evidence for an association between the presence of dingoes and the survival of threatened species, which is in agreement with the top predator hypothesis. The results of this study challenges the current assumption that the presence and ecological consequence of dingoes in sheep country are negligible and we suggest that wildlife managers verify whether dingoes are present before predator control is initiated. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose that habitat destruction and biodiversity loss associated with biotic homogenization can increase the incidence and distribution of infectious diseases affecting humans. The clearest connection between biotic homogenization and infectious disease is the spread of nonindigenous vectors and pathogens. The loss of predators and hosts that dilute pathogen transmission can also increase the incidence of vectorborne illnesses.

To that end, monitoring programmes have reported on the state of biodiversity using reference conditions as comparison. Little consensus exists on how reference conditions are defined and how such information is used to index intactness. Most use protected areas or an arbitrary year as reference. This is problematic since protected areas are often spatially biased, while arbitrarily defined reference years are often not sufficiently distant in time. We propose an alternative that relies on empirical estimates of reference conditions. Statistical ranges of reference are estimated and compared with observed occurrence and abundance to index status of individual species. When averaged among species, overall intactness is estimated. We demonstrate the approach using 202-winter mammal tracking sites from the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. Intactness was estimated at 89 out of 100 with the southern boreal having lowest intactness and greatest human footprint. We suggest empirical predictions of reference conditions be used as baselines for comparing changes in the state of species and biodiversity. Reporting can occur at any spatial (e.g., ecosystem) or hierarchical (e.g., species, guilds, taxonomic group, or overall biodiversity) scale and is easily interpreted (scaled from 0-degraded to 100-intact).

Seasonal and geographical variations in prevalence were positively related to the local density of the wildfowl community and to the wintering period of Eurasian migratory birds in Africa. The predominant influence of wildfowl density with no influence of climatic conditions suggests, in contrast to temperate regions, a predominant role for inter-individual transmission rather than transmission via long-lived virus persisting in the environment. Higher prevalences were found in Anas species than in non-Anas species even when we account for differences in their foraging behaviour (primarily dabbling or not) or their geographical origin (Eurasian or Afro-tropical), suggesting the existence of intrinsic differences between wildfowl taxonomic groups in receptivity to infection.

The concept of farming styles, which integrates human attitudes, farming objectives and economic success can be used to show the different ecological performances of farmers. A close link between mentality of farmers, land-use intensity and biodiversity could be established. Farmers who were highly production oriented supported the lowest nature values on their land, whereas both traditionally oriented and innovative farm businesses carried a higher potential to farm in concordance with the biodiversity of their landscape.

In this review we establish the relationship between eutrophication of fresh inland surface waters in SSA and the release of nutrients in their mega-cities. Monitoring reports indicate that the population of mega-cities in SSA is rapidly increasing, and so is the total amount of wastewater produced. Of the total amounts produced, at present, less than 30% is treated in sewage treatment plants, while the remainder is disposed of via onsite sanitation systems, eventually discharging their wastewater into groundwater. When related to the urban water balance of a number of SSA cities, the total amount of wastewater produced may be as high as 10-50% of the total precipitation entering these urban areas, which is considerable, especially since in most cases, precipitation is the most important, if not only the 'wastewater diluting agent' present. The most important knowledge gaps include: (1) the fate and transport mechanisms of nutrients (N and P) in soils and aquifers, or, conversely, the soil aquifer treatment characteristics of the regoliths, which cover a large part of SSA, (2) the effect of the episodic and largely uncontrolled removal of nutrients stored at urban surfaces by runoff from precipitation on nutrient budgets in adjacent lakes and rivers draining the urban areas, and (3) the hydrology and hydrogeology within the urban area, including surface water and groundwater flow patterns, transport velocities, dynamics of nutrient transport, and the presence of recharge and discharge areas. In order to make a start with managing this urban population-related eutrophication, many actions are required. As a first step, we suggest to start systematically researching the key areas identified above. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluates different land management scenarios in terms of ecosystem services in a South African rangeland, the Baviaanskloof catchment. As measured data were limited, we used simple models to quantify and map the effect of the different combination of agricultural, nature conservation and restoration practices on multiple ecosystem services. The land management scenarios were evaluated against management targets set for individual ecosystem services. Results highlight how the provision of ecosystem services is related to land management as unmanaged, pristine ecosystems provide a different mix of ecosystem services than ecosystems recently restored or managed as grazing lands. Results also indicate that historically overgrazed lands provide no forage, may retain 40% less sediment and have 38% lower biodiversity, while providing 60% more fuel wood and supplying two and half times more water (i.e. retaining less water), than pristine or restored lands. We conclude that a combination of light grazing, low input agriculture, nature conservation and restoration is the best for the sufficient provision of multiple ecosystem services. Applying such mixed management would improve biodiversity, ecotourism and maintain forage production and regulating services on farmers' land. This management option also fits into and further optimizes local decision-makers' vision regarding the future management of the area. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:00:37","2019-06-28T18:00:37Z",NA,"692–703",NA,"",45,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem degradation; Environmental decision-making; GIS; Mapping; Scenario; Thicket restoration",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We review the diffuse literature on the household effects of changing market access, migration, and technology adoption in remote regions and implications for native biodiversity. Market access affects biodiversity in remote communities through changes in household economics and social networks. Migration, either to or from remote settlements, affects biodiversity through changes in population, remittances, human capital, and social networks. Finally, we consider effects due to production, public infrastructure, and information and communication technologies. There is much ambiguity surrounding these causal pathways, and thus we also examine the roles of various ecological, household, community, and institutional mediating factors in determining the impacts of global connection. Finally, we explore the limitations of our current knowledge and research practices and propose directions for future work to address key uncertainties in theory and evidence as well as weaknesses in methodological approaches.

To address the dynamic dimension of the problem we consider tradable development rights as the instrument of choice. A particular challenge in applying tradable development rights is that the conservation benefit of an individual habitat patch depends on its spatial relationship with other habitat patches and thus is an emergent rather than a fixed property. We analyse with a conceptual model the spatial and temporal dynamics of habitats in a region under a tradable development rights market that takes spatial interaction of habitats explicitly into account. In our analysis two different outcomes may emerge depending on the levels of spatial interaction and cost heterogeneity: an â€ø eorderedâ€ structure where habitat patches are clustered in space and are stable over time, and a â€ø edisorderedâ€ structure where habitat patches are scattered in space and subject to high turnover of destruction and recreation. A high level of spatial interaction or a low level of cost heterogeneity favours an ordered structure while a low level of spatial interaction or a high level of cost heterogeneity favours a disordered structure.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:00:31","2019-06-28T18:00:31Z",NA,"1083–1092","","4","68",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation; Complex system; Cost heterogeneity; Ecological-economic model; Habitat banking; Pattern formation; Spatial interaction; Tradable development rights",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecologists have long questioned howthis diversity ismaintained1–3 . Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requirescompetitors to differ in their niches4–6 ; this hasmotivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity3,6–8 .That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors9 . The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecologicalcommunities10,11 .Herewe integrate theory and experi- mentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predictedbythenullmodel. Finally, inanexperimentmanipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare—the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.",2009,"2019-06-28 18:00:30","2019-06-28T18:00:30Z",NA,"","","","461",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The paper specifically addresses the questions on how local farmers read and predict the weather; and how they can collaborate with weather scientists in devising adaptation strategies for climate variability (CV) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Recent trends in agriculture-related weather variables available from country's climate services, as well as in freely available satellite rainfall products were analysed. The utility of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system for the study area in the context of supporting farmer's information needs were assessed. Through a multi-stage sampling procedure, a total of 592 households heads in 8 rural communities in the Okavango Delta were selected and interviewed using open and close-ended interview schedules. Also, 19 scientists were purposively selected and interviewed using questionnaires. Key informant interviews, focus group and knowledge validation workshops were used to generate qualitative information from both farmers and scientists. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in summarising the data. Analysis of satellite rainfall products indicated that there was a consistent increase in total annual rainfall throughout the region in the last 10. years, accompanied by an increase in number of rain days, and reduction of duration of dry spells. However, there is a progressive increase in the region's temperatures leading to increase in potential evaporation. Findings from social surveys show that farmers' age, education level, number of years engaged in farming, sources of weather information, knowledge of weather forecasting and decision on farming practices either had a significant relationship or correlation with their perceptions about the nature of both local [ethno-meteorological] and scientific weather knowledge. Nonetheless, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of farmers in relation to their perceptions and those of the climate scientists about the nature of both local and Western knowledge. As farmers are adept at judging seasonal patterns through long-standing ethno-meteorology, one major CV adaptation measure is their ability to anticipate changes in future weather conditions, which enables them to adjust their farming calendars and make decisions on crop type selection in any given season.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:00:24","2019-06-28T18:00:24Z",NA,"43–58","","","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate variability; Ethno-meteorology; Hydrology; Science; Small farmers; Weather forecast",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bio-geographic factors however play a crucial role in determining the level of risk associated with trade. We develop an analytical treatment of bioclimatic similarity between trade partners, within a model that links the incidence of invasive species to resource extraction, pollution and to import volumes disaggregated by country and region of origin.

Differing characteristics of urban areas can be conceptualised and subsequently mapped through the idea of urban morphology types (UMTs) - classifications which combine facets of urban form and function. When mapped, UMT units provide biophysically relevant meso-scale geographical zones which can be used as the basis for understanding climate-related impacts and adaptations. For example, they support the assessment of urban temperature patterns and the temperature regulation services provided by urban green structures. UMTs have been used for assessing regulating ecosystem services in European cities but little similar knowledge is available in an African context. This paper outlines the concept of UMTs and how they were applied to two African case study cities: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It then presents the data and methods used to understand provision of temperature regulation services across the two cities. In total, 35 detailed UMT classes were identified for Addis Ababa and 43 for Dar es Salaam. Modelled land surface temperature profiles for each of these UMTs are presented. The results demonstrate that urban morphological characteristics of UMTs, such as land surface cover proportions and associated built mass, have a much larger potential to alter neighbourhood level surface temperatures compared to projected climate changes. Land surface cover differences drive land surface temperature ranges over 25 ??C compared to climate change projections being associated with changes of less than 1.5 ??C. Residential UMTs account for the largest surface area of the cities, which are rapidly expanding due to population increase. Within the Residential UMTs, informal settlements and traditional housing areas are associated with the lowest land surface temperatures in Addis Ababa. These have higher proportions and better composition of green structures than other residential areas. The results have implications for planning policies in the cities. In Addis Ababa, the current urban renewal strategy to convert high density informal unplanned settlements into formal planned housing needs to explicitly account for green structure provision to avoid adverse effects on future supply of temperature regulation services. In Dar es Salaam, condominium UMTs have some of the largest proportions of green structures, and the best provision of temperature regulation services. In this case the challenge will be to maintain these into the future. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 18:00:03","2019-06-28T18:00:03Z",NA,"43–57","","","42",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Cities; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Land surface cover; Land surface temperature; Urban ecosystems; Urban morphology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current global approach to surveillance for wildlife diseases affecting biodiversity (“biodiversity diseases”) is still inadequate as demonstrated by the slow characterization and response to the two recent devastating epidemics, chytridiomycosis and white-nose syndrome [2]–[5]. Current surveillance for wildlife disease usually targets diseases that affect humans or livestock, not those impacting wildlife populations. Barriers to effective surveillance for biodiversity diseases include a relative lack of social and political will and the inherent complexity and cost of implementing surveillance for multiple and diverse free-ranging populations. Here we evaluate these challenges and the inadequacies of current surveillance techniques, and we suggest an integrated approach for effective surveillance. Despite challenges in quantifying the role of disease in species declines [6], there are numerous clear examples of diseases (infectious, toxic, multifactorial, or of undetermined origin) that have caused severe population impacts; for example, avian malaria and poxvirus in Hawaii, diclofenac poisoning in Indian vultures, rinderpest in Africa, bighorn sheep pneumonia, chronic wasting disease, crayfish plague, avian trichomonosis, and Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease [7]–[15]. The emergence of the amphibian fungal skin disease chytridiomycosis is a pertinent example in which a lack of effective disease surveillance contributed to global biodiversity loss (Figure 1) [16]–[18]. Epidemiological investigation did not commence until 15 years after initial declines [19]. Despite recent listing of chytridiomycosis as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the extended time before diagnosis very likely contributed to the decline and extinction of at least 200 species of frogs globally, helping to make amphibians the most endangered vertebrate class [3], [20].",2014,"2019-06-28 17:59:57","2019-06-28T17:59:57Z",NA,"","","5","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24875394",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study explicitly determines trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and livestock grazing intensity on rangelands. Grazing intensity and its effects on forage utilization by livestock, carbon sequestration, erosion prevention and biodiversity are quantified and mapped, using global datasets and models. Results show that on average 4% of the biomass produced annually is consumed by livestock. On average, erosion prevention is 10% lower in areas with a high grazing intensity compared to areas with a low grazing intensity, whereas carbon emissions are more than four times higher under high grazing intensity compared to low grazing intensity. Rangelands with the highest grazing intensity are located in the Sahel, Pakistan, West India, Middle East, North Africa and parts of Brazil. These high grazing intensities result in carbon emissions, low biodiversity values, low capacity for erosion prevention and unsustainable forage utilization. Although the applied models simplify the processes of ecosystem service supply, our study provides a global overview of the consequences of grazing for biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Twenty-three publications, including twenty-nine case studies, were reviewed with the aim of investigating how local knowledge, community-based conservation, and resilience interrelate in social-ecological systems. We highlight that such relationships have not been systematically addressed in regions where a great number of community conservation initiatives are found; and we identify a set of factors that foster people's adaptive capacity to social-ecological change and a number of social processes that, in contrast, undermine such capacity and the overall resilience of the social-ecological system. We suggest that there is a need to further investigate how climate variability and other events affect the joint evolution of conservation outcomes and traditional ecological knowledge, and there is a need to expand the current focus on social factors to explain changes in traditional ecological knowledge and adaptive capacity towards a broader approach that pays attention to ecosystem dynamics and environmental change.",2013,"2019-06-28 17:59:54","2019-06-28T17:59:54Z",NA,"","","4","18",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive capacity; Biodiversity conservation; Community-based conservation; Ecosystem services; Local ecological knowledge; Natural resource management; Social-ecological change; Social-ecological resilience; Traditional ecological knowledge",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results from the growing corpus of quantitative studies show that: a) bushmeat remains the primary source of animal protein for the majority of Congo Basin families; b) bushmeat hunting can constitute a significant source of revenue for forest families; c) bushmeat consumption by low density populations living in the forest may be sustainable at present; d) demand for bushmeat by growing numbers of urban consumers has created a substantial market for bushmeat that is resulting in a halo of defaunation around population centres, and may be driving unsustainable levels of hunting, even in relatively isolated regions; and e) large bodied animals with low reproductive rates are most susceptible to over-exploitation compared with more r-selected species that apparently can tolerate relatively intensive hunting (Mangel et al. 1996). As urban populations continue to grow and economies revitalise, unless action is taken to alter the demand for, and the supply of bushmeat, the forests of the Congo Basin will be progressively stripped of certain wildlife species, risking their extirpation or extinction, and the loss of values they confer to local economies. Consequently, it is essential that a) logging companies are encouraged or coerced not to facilitate bushmeat hunting and transportation in their concessions, b) we develop a better understanding of the elasticity of bushmeat demand, c) that pilot bushmeat substitution projects are supported and their impact on demand evaluated, and d) social marketing activities are put in place to attempt to direct consumer preferences for animal protein away from bushmeat species that are particularly susceptible to over-exploitation.",1999,"2019-06-28 17:59:52","2019-06-28T17:59:52Z",NA,"927–955","","7","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bushmeat; Central Africa; Conservation; Hunting; Tropical forest; Wildlife",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Removal of apex predators can result in changes to intraguild interactions and outbreaks of mesopredators ('mesopredator release'), leading in turn to increased predation on smaller prey. Here we provide a review and synthesis of studies of predator interactions, mesopredator release and their impacts on biodiversity. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators is widespread geographically and taxonomically. Apex predators suppress mesopredators both by killing them, or instilling fear, which motivates changes in behaviour and habitat use that limit mesopredator distribution and abundance. Changes in the abundance of apex predators may have disproportionate (up to fourfold) effects on mesopredator abundance. Outcomes of interactions between predators may however vary with resource availability, habitat complexity and the complexity of predator communities. There is potential for the restoration of apex predators to have benefits for biodiversity conservation through moderation of the impacts of mesopredators on their prey, but this requires a whole-ecosystem view to avoid unforeseen negative effects.

Both biodiversity loss and infectious disease have taken on importance in the last two decades and both are related to human disturbance of natural systems. Intuitively, one might expect the most diverse natural habitats to support the greatest number of animal diseases that could be transmitted to humans (zoonotic diseases). Yet an examination of the circumstances surrounding outbreaks of rodent-borne hemorrhagic fevers suggests that anthropogenically disturbed, low-diversity habitats present the greatest risk. Two possible mechanisms are suggested to help explain this increased risk. First, disturbed habitats often favor opportunistic/generalist species which happen to be reservoirs for hemorrhagic fever viruses. Second, through a process called the dilution effect, in communities of lowering rodent diversity, more and more virus transmission events (aggressive encounters) occur within a single species, usually an opportunistic species which is the specific host for a hemorrhagic fever virus. The result is more efficient transmission of the virus within the host population, higher prevalence of infection in the host, and greater risk to humans. Results of virus monitoring among rodent populations in the southwestern United States are consistent with predictions of the dilution effect hypothesis. Additional monitoring, sampling, and laboratory experimentation are needed to fully understand the relationship between biodiversity and human disease. This monitoring can be accomplished most effectively through collaboration of scientists from both ecological and public health disciplines.",2006,"2019-06-28 17:59:37","2019-06-28T17:59:37Z",NA,"9–17","","1","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This makes them the focus of environmental and social scientists as well as of practitioners and land managers. This volume brings together a wealth of knowledge of the British uplands from diverse but inter-related fields of study, clearly demonstrating their importance in twenty-first-century Britain, and indicating how we may through interdiscip-linary approaches meet the challenges provided by past and future drivers of environmental change. The upland environments are subject to change. They face imminent threats as well as opportunities from pressures such as climate change, changes in land management and related changes in fire risk, increases in erosion and water colour, degradation of habitats, altered wildlife and recreational value, as well as significant changes in the economy of these marginal areas. This book presents up-to-date scientific background information, addresses policy-related issues and lays out pressing land management questions. A number of world-class experts provide a review of cutting-edge natural and social science and an assessment of past, current and potential future management strategies, policies and other drivers of change. After appraisal of key con-cepts and principles, chapters provide specific examples and applications by focusing on UK upland areas and specifically on the Peak District National Park as a key example for other highly valuable upland regions.

Because biodiversity is the essence of life itself, these metrics are essential for effectiveness in the theory and practice of eco-efficiency, particularly in the case of primary natural resource extraction industries such as fishing and forestry. The case of fishing is examined, with particular attention to by-catch, lost nets, and habitat damage caused by mobile fishing gears. It is appropriate to examine fishing because industrial era impacts on marine biodiversity have been severe and are driving large and deleterious changes in marine ecosystems. For discarded by-catch, it is proposed that an eco-efficient metric for the value per unit mass of discarded fish can be set to be equivalent to that of the market value of the utilized catch. In estimating the eco-efficient value of the catch, the value of the discarded fish is then subtracted from the market value of the catch. Fish killed in lost nets can be treated similarly. It is more difficult to address marine habitat damage by mobile fishing gear, which has the highest potential for ecological injury. By using the approach proposed, negative eco-efficiencies are obtained under circumstances in which the collateral damage to biodiversity exceeds the economic benefit obtained. This is a logical outcome given the long-term effects of biodiversity decline. A metric is also proposed for assessing whether avoidance of harm to biodiversity, in the form of switching fishing gear, is required. Lastly it is proposed that metrics might be developed to provide eco-efficiency credit for companies taking effective actions to improve, or actively participate in, ecosystem-based fisheries management.",2009,"2019-06-28 17:59:34","2019-06-28T17:59:34Z",NA,"348–353","","3","17",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; By-catch; Eco-efficiency; Metrics of waste; Trawl fisheries",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Drivers of the observed streamflow changes are multiple, including climate change (CC), land use and land cover changes (LULCC), water transfers and river impoundment. Many of these drivers inter-act simultaneously, making it difficult to discern the impact of each driver individually. In this study we isolate the effects of LULCC on the observed streamflow reduction in the Upper Turia basin (east Spain) during the period 1973-2008. Regression models of annual streamflow are fitted with climatic variables and also additional time variant drivers like LULCC. The ecohydrological model SWAT is used to study the magnitude and sign of streamflow change when LULCC occurs. Our results show that LULCC does play a significant role on the water balance, but it is not the main driver underpinning the observed reduction on Turia's streamflow. Increasing mean temperature is the main factor supporting increasing evapotranspiration and streamflow reduction. In fact, LULCC and CC have had an offsetting effect on the streamflow generation during the study period. While streamflow has been negatively affected by increasing temperature, ongoing LULCC have positively compensated with reduced evapotranspiration rates, thanks to mainly shrubland clearing and forest degradation processes. These findings are valuable for the management of the Turia river basin, as well as a useful approach for the determination of the weight of LULCC on the hydrological response in other regions.",2015,"2019-06-28 17:59:28","2019-06-28T17:59:28Z",NA,"258–268","","","503-504",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25115604",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change (CC); Ecohydrological modeling; Iberian Peninsula; Land use and land cover changes (LULCC); SWAT; Streamflow trends",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The decadal scale is examined using modern data covering the twentieth century. The century scale is examined using historical reconstructions of climate, based on a combination of geologic, geographic and historical information (e.g., lake chronologies, landscape descriptions, archives and diaries). The presentation includes some results of an analysis of a new historical semi-quantitative data set for Africa covering the last two centuries. It was produced using a combination of historical information, nineteenth century rainfall records, and statistical relationships among various sectors of Africa. Presented here are reconstructions of lake level fluctuations for numerous lakes of eastern and southern Africa. This overview of climatic fluctuations is utilized to uncover inherent spatial and temporal characteristics of the rainfall variability. The dominance over time of various spatial modes is emphasized and the questions of synchroneity of the hemispheres and the abruptness of change are considered. The contrast between the two hemispheres is also surveyed, notably the different time scales of variability and potential causal factors in the variability. One of the most important contrasts is the multi-decadal persistence of anomalies over most of northern Africa. This has implications for the causes of long-term fluctuations, even those historical and paleo-time scales.

Clearly, growth or reproduction will only be observed in organisms that survive. Because it is common to observe mortality in studies focusing on the reproduction of organisms, especially in higher concentration conditions, the resulting observed numbers of young become a mixture of zeroes and positive counts. Zeroes are recorded for organisms that die before having any young and living organisms with no offspring. Positive counts are recorded for living organisms with offspring. Thus, responses reflect both fecundity and mortality of the organisms used in such tests. In the present study, the authors propose the estimation of the concentration associated with a specified level of reproductive inhibition (RIp) using a Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model. This approach allows any prior information and expert knowledge about the model parameters to be incorporated into the regression coefficients or RIp estimation. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the Bayesian ZIP regression model and classical methods. The Bayesian estimator outperforms the frequentist alternative by producing more precise point estimates with smaller mean square differences between RIp estimates and true values, narrower interval estimates with better coverage probabilities.

We discuss two components of biodiversity change-biodiversity alterations and biodiversity loss-across four dimensions of biodiversity: species extinctions, species abundances, species distributions, and genetic diversity. We briefly review the impacts that modern humans and their ancestors have had on biodiversity and discuss the recent declines and alterations in biodiversity. We analyze the direct pressures on biodiversity change: habitat change, overexploitation, exotic species, pollution, and climate change. We discuss the underlying causes, such as demographic growth and resource use, and review existing scenario projections.

These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes.

In this paper, we review the existing research on and empirical evidence of how climate change and climate variability in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) affects two main drivers of migration identified by migration models in the economic literature, namely income level differentials between origin and destination areas and income variability in origin areas, and how they in turn affect migration. We find that there are serious gaps in both the economic and the environmental literature that render it impossible to make sound and robust predictions of how climate change and increased climate variability will affect the economic migration drivers, and of how these in turn may change existing migration patterns. There are some empirical indications that income differentials may increase due to lower income levels in the origin areas of LDCs, but virtually no evidence exists of the effects of climate change or increased climate variability on income variability. Furthermore, although a negative relationship between migration and rainfall has been established by many researchers, there is only very limited evidence as to what drives it. A clearer picture of the driving force behind the link between rainfall and migration would greatly benefit policymaking in this area. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2011","2019-06-28 17:59:05","2019-06-28T17:59:05Z",NA,"","","SUPPL. 1",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Climate variability; Economic drivers; LDCs; Migration",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The payment for environmental services (PES) is an innovative conservation tool to capitalize on the sustainable and non-destructive use of its natural assets of a nation, such as forests, biodiversity and water resources and its unaccounted social and economic contribution to the well being of society. This is twice as valuable in the face on climate change effects on water availability, rainfall, and energy crisis and pollution on air and water quality. The PES can represent a valuable vehicle to green growth (GG) objective and goals since it is a new platform to launch proactive private sector participation. Environmental stewardship can be promoted through capital investment in renewable energy projects such as hydropower, which is highly dependent on a healthy and protected watershed. Its intimate link to carbon emission reduction markets can provide a new business opportunity while creating a new source of income to traditional land uses that compete against forest and watersheds. Additional to this economic opportunity, the greening of taxes can jump start an initial level of financial self-sustainability to conservation while attaining development benefits. The legal aspect of PES is by far, the area most widely developed and addressed. The political interest in countries seeking to formulate and establish official policy, legislation and environmental regulations, has generated a quite important flow of knowledge and expertise in the subject. There is a wide acceptance that PES should be entailed at all levels of society. The main principle that drives PES is economic in essence. Nonetheless, the economics are probably the most difficult area to understand, argue and develop for practical purposes. Environmental services are commonly associated to moral or existence values with little or no market price. Approximating a monetary value of these ecological functions has become one of the most challenging topics in the PES discussion. The “how to” valuate environmental services is open to debate. Nonetheless, the reality is that engaging in exhaustive discussions on conceptual and methodological issues, often distracts from taking initial concrete steps to legitimize PES from an economic point of view. The crucial and largely ignored fact, relies in that making users pay any amount above zero, becomes a gateway to acknowledging officially environmental services, and to mainstreaming PES into the public awareness. Estimating a monetary value of PES will entail further discussion that can enhance arguments, while strengthening national capacity and the opportunity of a “learn by doing” experience. Testing the potential of PES within rural poverty reduction programmes has become a major interest to many countries. Particularly in South-East Asia, clearing forestland for low value agriculture contributes significantly to deforestation rates. This results in the loss of valuable environmental services to society, such as reduced water flow and quality, and in the negative effects of siltation. The PES mechanism may contribute to reducing the environmental degradation associated to poverty and eliminating the perverse incentives of forest conversion, by providing an extra income for farmers and other forest users in exchange for the sustainable and non destructive use of forest","2007","2019-06-28 17:59:05","2019-06-28T17:59:05Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This lake has historically supported a highly productive pelagic fishery that currently provides 25-40% of the animal protein supply for the populations of the surrounding countries. In parallel with regional warming patterns since the beginning of the twentieth century, a rise in surface-water temperature has increased the stability of the water column. A regional decrease in wind velocity has contributed to reduced mixing, decreasing deep-water nutrient upwelling and entrainment into surface waters. Carbon isotope records in sediment cores suggest that primary productivity may have decreased by about 20%, implying a roughly 30% decrease in fish yields.

Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada's Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the ""average"" climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without ""extreme"" weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.","2013","2019-06-28 17:58:51","2019-06-28T17:58:51Z",NA,"875–886","","",310,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem-based management; Extreme drought; Future climate and fire scenarios; Natural disturbance; Wildfire",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But there are no clear trends in the reduction of fire catastrophes. Fire activity will intensify with increasing climate variability and extreme events that are projected under climate change. This makes it pertinent to review current fire management strategies and explore more sustainable approaches to fire risk. Botswana experiences frequent unplanned fires that are driven by a combination of climatic factors, policy, land use and social behavior. The country relies on a fire management system that is skewed towards fire suppression and centralized around Government although faced with vast fire prone areas and lacking in resources, coordination and management capacity. This approach has de-coupled fire management from land use and livelihoods that ironically rely on fire and account for most fire outbreaks, putting the country at high risk of fire disasters. This paper explored mechanisms for establishing a sustainable fire management approach in Botswana that is centered on land use fire needs. A fire management strategy that is based on the use of fire for land use management will be community inclusive. Where an appropriate institutional framework is provided, this approach will facilitate effective use of resources, integration of indigenous and modern knowledge systems and help re-focus fire management away from suppression. A community inclusive fire management approach has a greater potential to be of benefit to both land use and ecological requirements of fire and contribute towards adaptation to climate change. ?? 2013 The Author.","2013","2019-06-28 17:58:47","2019-06-28T17:58:47Z",NA,"26–41","","",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Botswana; Community based fire management; Fire prevention; Fire suppression; Land use fire needs; Sustainable fire management",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, releasing the ecological benefits of predators entails significant challenges. Here, we discuss the economic, environmental and social considerations affecting predator-driven ecological restoration programmes, and suggest approaches for reducing the undesirable impacts of predators. Because the roles of predators are context dependent, we argue for increased emphasis on predator functionality in ecosystems and less on the identities and origins of species and genotypes. We emphasise that insufficient attention is currently given to the importance of variation in the social structures and behaviours of predators in influencing the dynamics of trophic interactions. Lastly, we outline experiments specifically designed to clarify the ecological roles of predators and their potential utility in ecosystem restoration. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2012","2019-06-28 17:58:45","2019-06-28T17:58:45Z",NA,"","265–271","",27,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1016/j.tree.2012.01.001 PMID: 22321653",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis shows that migration to urban centers in mega-deltas is an outcome of many forces: economic policies and incentives, local and destination institutions, government policies to develop small towns, and the geographic concentration of investments. Massive influx of capital to many deltas has transformed the local economic base from a primarily agricultural one to a manufacturing and processing economy. This has created uneven spatial economic development which is the underlying driver of migration to cities in the mega-deltas regardless of geographic context or size. Going forward to 2060, one critical challenge for all the deltas is to increase the labor skill of their workforce and foster technology innovation. Continued economic growth in these regions will require substantial investments in education and capacity building and the ability of urban centers to absorb the migrant labor pool. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2011","2019-06-28 17:58:38","2019-06-28T17:58:38Z",NA,"","","SUPPL. 1",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Drivers of migration; Economic reforms; Globalization; Rural-urban migration; Sea level rise; Urban growth; Urbanization",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The hypothesis of this paper is that rainfall patterns impact changes in income within our study region of central and northern Mozambique. Utilizing satellite-based estimates of rainfall analyzed within a GIS, we establish a 12-year rainfall climatology and calculate monthly rainfall anomalies for 419 villages during three growing seasons. We also approximate storm-total rainfall from tropical cyclones entering the Mozambique Channel. Hierarchical cluster analysis groups the villages according to the monthly rainfall anomalies and rainfall received from Cyclones Delfina and Japhet. Then, using data from the National Agricultural Survey of Mozambique conducted in 2002 and 2005, we relate rainfall and change in income through the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients and independent-samples t tests using village-groups produced by the cluster analysis. We find that no season closely approximates the 12-year climatology and that rainfall varied among the three seasons. Although most villages experience income declines, those affected by Delfina exhibit the worst economic performance, indicating that heavy rainfall from some tropical cyclones can have long-lasting negative effects on income. Additionally, receiving above-normal rainfall may hinder economic well-being more than below-normal rainfall. Our study identifies patterns in sub-national rainfall variability and economic well-being that enable a more detailed understanding of weather-related effects on socio-economic outcomes.","2013","2019-06-28 17:58:31","2019-06-28T17:58:31Z",NA,"31–49","","1",66,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Climate variability; Mozambique; Rainfall; Rural development; Tropical cyclones",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ecosystems for which data were available ranged in mean annual rainfall from 320 mm (Sudan) to 1150 mm (Republic of Congo) and include a spectrum of vegetation types (or land cover) (open savannas, woodlands, croplands and grasslands). Given the shortness of the record, the EC data were analysed across the network rather than longitudinally at sites, in order to understand the driving factors for ecosystem respiration and carbon assimilation, and to reveal the different water use strategies in these highly seasonal environments. Values for maximum net carbon assimilation rates (photosynthesis) ranged from -12.5 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) in a dry, open Millet cropland (C(4)-plants) up to -48 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) for a tropical moist grassland. Maximum carbon assimilation rates were highly correlated with mean annual rainfall (r(2)=0.74). Maximum photosynthetic uptake rates (Fp(max)) were positively related to satellite-derived f(APAR). Ecosystem respiration was dependent on temperature at all sites, and was additionally dependent on soil water content at sites receiving less than 1000 mm of rain per year.

The highest THg concentration (636 ng g-1 wet weight) was measured for a piscivorous tigerfish Hydrocynus forskahlii from Lake Turkana. THg concentrations for the Perciformes species, the Nile perch Lates niloticus from Lake Turkana and the largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides from Lake Naivasha ranged between 4 and 95 ng g-1. The tilapiine species in all lakes, including the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, had consistently low THg concentrations ranging between 2 and 25 ng g-1. In Lake Naivasha, the crayfish species, Procambrus clarkii, had THg concentrations similar to those for the tilapiine species from the same lake, which is consistent with their shared detritivore diet. THg concentrations in all fish species were usually consistent with their known trophic position, with highest concentrations in piscivores and declining in omnivores, insectivores and detritivores. One exception is the detritivore Labeo cylindricus from Lake Baringo, which had surprisingly elevated THg concentrations (mean=75 ng g -1), which was similar to those for the top trophic species (Clarias and Protopterus) in the same lake. Except for two Hydrocynus forskahlii individuals from Lake Turkana, which had THg concentrations near or above the international marketing limit of 500 ng g-1, THg concentrations in the fish were generally below those of World Health Organization's recommended limit of 200 ng g-1 for at-risk groups. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, its dependence on meteorological factors subjects it to climate change. Studies analysing the impact of climate change on wind resources usually only model changes in wind speed. Two elements that have to be calculated in addition to wind speed changes are Annual Energy Production (AEP) and Power Density (PD). This is not only because of the inherent variability between wind speed and wind power generated, but also because of the relative magnitudes of change in energy potentially generat- ed at different areas under varied wind climates. In this study, it was assumed that two separate loca- tions would experience a 10% wind speed increase after McInnes et al. (2010). Given the two locations' different wind speed distributions, a wind speed increase equal in magnitude is not equivalent to similar magnitudes of change in potential energy production in these areas. This paper demonstrates this fact for each of the case studies. It is of general interest to the energy field and is of value since very little literature exists in the Southern African context on climate change- or variability-effects on the (wind) energy sector. Energy output is therefore dependent not only on wind speed, but also wind turbine characteristics.

Transition between phases occurs when ecological thresholds have been crossed, and is followed by a reorganization of biotic and environmental interactions, leading to the emergence of a new vegetation phase or quasi-stable state. Savannas are dynamic, complex systems in which fire, herbivory, water and nutrient availability interact to determine tree abundance. Phase and transition has been observed in savannas, but the role of these different possible drivers is not always clear. In this study, our objectives were to identify phase and transition in the fossil pollen record, and then to explore the role of nitrogen and fire in these transitions using delta N-15 isotopes and charcoal abundance. We present palaeoenvironmental data from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, which show transition between grassland and savanna phases. Our results show transition at the end of the ninth century A.D. from a nutrient- and herbivore-limited grazing lawn, in which fire was absent and C-4 grasses were the dominant and competitively superior plant form, to a water-, fire- and herbivory-limited semi-arid savanna, in which C-4 grasses and C-3 trees and shrubs co-existed. The data accord with theoretical frameworks that predict that variability in ecosystems clusters in regions of higher probability space, interspersed by rapid transitions between these phases. The data are also consistent with the idea that phase transitions involve switching between different dominant driving processes or limiting factors.","2009","2019-06-28 17:52:01","2019-06-28T17:52:01Z",NA,"1189–1203","","7",12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Charcoal; Feedbacks; Hysteresis; Isotopes; Phase; Pollen; Transition",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As such, it is often necessary that a range of incentive measures are utilised to ensure both the private and the public benefits of its conservation or sustainable use are realised. Incentive measures available for this purpose include economic incentives (such as taxes, charges, tradable use rights, and subsidies), regulatory measures (such as development or access restrictions), and the provision of relevant information and sufficient institutional capacity. While many of the direct use values of biodiversity are privately appropriable given a clear assignment of property rights and the existence of markets, other financing methods are often necessary for the realisation of other values, such as indirect use values, non-use values and option values. This paper expands the analysis in the Handbook of Incentive Measures for Biodiversity: Design and Implementation (OECD, 1999) developed under the responsibility of the OECD Expert Group on Economic Aspects of Biodiversity to discuss some of the methods available for financing incentive measures for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Where appropriate, case studies of experiences in OECD countries are drawn upon to provide practical examples of the financing and implementation of incentive measures.","1999","2019-06-28 17:51:06","2019-06-28T17:51:06Z",NA,"133–144","","1â€“3",240,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Environmental economics; Incentive measures",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Costs for such measures are relatively easy to establish, but benefits are less easily estimated. Economics can help guide the design of biodiversity policy by eliciting public preferences on different attributes of biodiversity. However, this is complicated by the generally low level of awareness and understanding of what biodiversity means on the part of the general public. In this paper we report research that applied the choice experiment and contingent valuation methods to value the diversity of biological diversity. Focus groups were used to identify ecological concepts of biodiversity that were important and relevant to the public, and to discover how best to describe these concepts in a meaningful and understandable manner. A choice experiment examined a range of biodiversity attributes including familiarity of species, species rarity, habitat, and ecosystem processes, while a contingent valuation study examined public willingness to pay for biodiversity enhancements associated with agri-environmental and habitat re-creation policy. The key conclusions drawn from the valuation studies were that the public has positive valuation preferences for most, but not all, aspects of biodiversity, but that they appeared to be largely indifferent to how biodiversity protection was achieved. Finally, we also investigate the extent to which valuation workshop approaches to data collection can overcome some of the possible information problems associated with the valuation of complex goods.

Drawing on the legacy of previous large-scale environmental assessments, the CF goes further in explicitly embracing different disciplines and knowledge systems (including indigenous and local knowledge) in the co-construction of assessments of the state of the world's biodiversity and the benefits it provides to humans. The CF can be thought of as a kind of ""Rosetta Stone"" that highlights commonalities between diverse value sets and seeks to facilitate crossdisciplinary and crosscultural understanding. We argue that the CF will contribute to the increasing trend towards interdisciplinarity in understanding and managing the environment.

One suggestion for the change in precipitation pattern is a shift in the global coupled ocean-atmosphere system during the late 1970s. We investigate the variability in inter-annual regional precipitation dynamics pre/post the late 1970s climate shift within the Okavango-Kwando-Zambezi (OKZ) catchment in southern Africa through a descriptive spatio-temporal analysis of rainfall patterns from 1950 to 2005. Annual precipitation totals for each basin are calculated and numbers of wet (upper tercile) and dry (lower tercile) years in two periods (1950-75 and 1980-2005) are compared. Rainfall associated with, and frequency of, El Ni??o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are also investigated. Coincidences of extremes in local and regional rainfall are examined to determine how association in precipitation patterns may vary across the catchment. Results indicate decreasing precipitation and increased dry years with warm phases of ENSO across all three sub-catchments. This has important implications for the future Kavango-Zambezi Transboundary Conservation Area (KAZA), a region that provides a vital wildlife corridor through which local precipitation and exotic streamflow constitute important water sources in an otherwise water-limited ecosystem. ?? 2012.","2012","2019-06-28 17:48:23","2019-06-28T17:48:23Z",NA,"19–30","","",82,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Annual precipitation; Climate shift; ENSO; Southern Africa",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Looking towards 2050, the question is how fisheries governance, and the national and international policy and legal frameworks within which it is nested, will ensure a sustainable harvest, maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and adapt to climate change. This paper looks at global fisheries production, the state of resources, contribution to food security and governance. It describes the main changes affecting the sector, including geographical expansion, fishing capacity-building, natural variability, environmental degradation and climate change.

Urgent and considerable efforts must be made from now on to cataloge, understand, preserve, and enhance the value of biodiversity while ensuring food safety and human and animal health. Ambitious integrated and multifield research programs must be implemented in order to understand the causes and anticipate the consequences of loss of biodiversity. Such losses are a serious threat to sustainable development and to the quality of life of future generations. They have an influence on the natural balance of global biodiversity in particularly in reducing the capability of species to adapt rapidly by genetic mutations to survive in modified ecosystems. Usually, the natural immune systems of mammals (both human and animal), are highly polymorphic and able to adapt rapidly to new situations. We more specifically discuss the fact that if the genetic diversity of the affected populations is low the invading microorganisms, will suddenly expand and create epidemic outbreaks with risks of pandemic. So biodiversity appears to function as an important barrier (buffer), especially against disease-causing organisms, which can function in different ways. Finally, we discuss the importance of preserving biodiversity mainly in the wildlife ecosystems as an integrated and sustainable approach among others in order to prevent and control the emergence or reemergence of diseases in animals and humans (zoonosis).

Allen","Mycorrhizal fungi mediation of terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change: Mini-review","Fungal Ecology","","17545048","10.1016/j.funeco.2014.01.005","","Mycorrhizal fungi are responsible for most nutrient uptake by the majority of land plants. As such, mycorrhizas are increasingly recognized as important drivers of terrestrial ecosystem processes, and may mediate ecosystem responses to environmental change. Here we review published studies that explicitly address the role of mycorrhizal influence on ecosystem responses such as biogeochemical fluxes and pools, ecosystem productivity, and dominant vegetative growth responses to global change. We find that most studies are of limited duration (???1 yr) and geographical distribution. A strong bias in the literature regarding the location of studied ecosystems, with large parts of the globe, such as highly-weathered soil systems in the tropics, subtropics and warm temperate biomes, accounting for ∼30 % of the global land base, greatly under-investigated. In terms of mediating ecosystem responses to global change, mycorrhizal-plant symbioses exhibit conflicting responses although some generalities do exist. Plants often shift carbon allocation belowground and the activities of mycorrhizal associates are frequently enhanced at elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions, but the direct effects for ecosystem dynamics are less clear. Mycorrhizal associations reduce plant stress under drought conditions. How mycorrhizal root colonization responds to nitrogen deposition depends on the type of mycorrhizas and background levels of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. The capacity of mycorrhizas for mediating plant and ecosystem responses to warming are varied, but over 60 % of these studies found increased mycorrhizal abundance and decreased mycorrhizal activity with warmer temperatures. This review suggests the role mycorrhizal fungi play in ecosystems responding to global change is not well understood. We emphasize the need for more research in this emerging field, as such responses and ecosystem feedbacks to Earth's climate system are of concern to multiple scientific disciplines and society. ?? 2014 .","2014","2019-06-28 17:48:07","2019-06-28T17:48:07Z",NA,"3–19","","1",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Arbuscular; Climate change; Ecosystem; Ectomycorrhiza; Global change; Mycorrhiza",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Issues such as biodiversity, environmental crises, livelihoods, clan politics, and landscapes are addressed in the poems, while conveying themes of abundance, drought, changing landscape, and livestock raids. In these oral poems, tha animate and inanimate environment, including rangeland plants, mountains, rivers, lakes, animals, the weather, and spirits, are used in metaphoric, symbolic, and realistic expressions. Embedded in these poems are the ecological and social philosophy and wisdom of Afar nomads as well as their concerns about contemporary environmental problems. Oral traditions can be used to understand ecological wisdom and perceptions of tribal communities and provide insights into and lessons in sustainable living.","2016","2019-06-28 14:48:21","2019-06-28T14:48:21Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are more than 300 satellite images, 300 ground photographs and 150 maps, along with informative graphs and charts that give a vivid visual portrayal of Africa and its changing environment. Using current and historical satellite images, the Atlas provides scientific evidence of the impact that natural and human activities have had on the continent's environment over the past several decades. The observations and measurements of environmental change illustrated in this Atlas help gauge the extent of progress made by African countries towards reaching the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals. More importantly, this book contributes to the knowledge and understanding that are essential for adaptation and remediation. This UNEP publication should be of immense value to all those who want to know more about Africa and who care about the future of this continent.","","2019-06-28 14:48:21","2019-06-28T14:48:21Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ethiopia is on the way to equipping itself with such a tool.In this article we argue that Ethiopia offers an exceptionally good terrain for setting up such a mechanism. It has many products derived from the exploitation of biodiversity by a variety of cultural groups. Many of these products already have reputations linked to their cultural geographical origin. The existence of competitive national and international markets requires labels and protection systems.Nevertheless adoption of a Geographical Indications system is not without its problems. The specific circumstances of the Ethiopian context – social and institutional as well as environmental – raise questions as to the limitations and possible risks of such a system, including the unequal development of certain components of biodiversity, standardization and loss of know-how, modification of current territorial subdivisions and the corresponding social and administrative organizational structures.","2007","2019-06-28 14:48:16","2019-06-28T14:48:16Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fundamentally, we must know where individual species live, which ones are vulnerable, where human actions threaten them, and their levels of protection. As conservation knowledge and threats change, we must reevaluate priorities. We mapped priority areas for vertebrates using newly updated data on \textgreater21,000 species of mammals, amphibians, and birds. For each taxon, we identified centers of richness for all species, small-ranged species, and threatened species listed with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Importantly, all analyses were at a spatial grain of 10 × 10 km, 100 times finer than previous assessments. This fine scale is a significant methodological improvement, because it brings mapping to scales comparable with regional decisions on where to place protected areas. We also mapped recent species discoveries, because they suggest where as-yet-unknown species might be living. To assess the protection of the priority areas, we calculated the percentage of priority areas within protected areas using the latest data from the World Database of Protected Areas, providing a snapshot of how well the planet's protected area system encompasses vertebrate biodiversity. Although the priority areas do have more protection than the global average, the level of protection still is insufficient given the importance of these areas for preventing vertebrate extinctions. We also found substantial differences between our identified vertebrate priorities and the leading map of global conservation priorities, the biodiversity hotspots. Our findings suggest a need to reassess the global allocation of conservation resources to reflect today's improved knowledge of biodiversity and conservation.","2013","2019-06-28 14:48:04","2019-06-28T14:48:04Z",NA,"2602–2610","","28",110,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23803854",NA,NA,NA,"Biogeography; Endemism; Species distribution; conservation planning",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has contributed to a divisive and unresolved debate concerning the compatibility of environmental and socioeconomic development goals. Elucidating the relationship between positive and negative social impacts and conservation outcomes of PAs is key for the development of more effective and socially just conservation. Here, we conduct a global analysis of how PAs affect the wellbeing of local people, the factors associated with these impacts, and crucially the relationship between PAs' conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Our results show that PAs reporting positive socioeconomic outcomes are more likely to report positive conservation outcomes. We find positive conservation and socioeconomic outcomes are more likely to occur when PAs adopt co-management regimes, empower local people, reduce economic inequalities and maintain cultural and livelihood benefits. While the strictest regimes of PA management attempt to exclude anthropogenic influences to achieve biological conservation objectives, our study provides evidence that PAs that explicitly integrate local people as stakeholders tend to be more effective at achieving joint biological conservation and socioeconomic development outcomes. Strict protection may be needed in some circumstances, yet our results demonstrate that conservation and development objectives can be synergistic and highlight management strategies that increase the probability of achieving win-win scenarios that maximize conservation performance and development outcomes of PAs.

Abstract?Contemporary policy analysis of the governance of common-pool resources is based on three core assumptions: (a) resource users are norm-free maximizers of immediate gains, who will not cooperate to overcome the commons dilemmas they face; (b) designing rules to change incentives of participants is a relatively simple analytical task; and (c) organization itself requires central direction. The chapter shows that these assumptions are a poor foundation for policy analysis. Findings from carefully controlled laboratory experiments that challenge the first assumption are summarized. A different assumption that humans are fallible, boundedly rational, and norm-using is adopted. The complexity of using rules as tools to change the structure of commons dilemmas is then discussed, drawing on extensive research on rules in field settings. Viewing all policies as experiments with a probability of failure, recent research on a different form of general organization?that of complex adaptive systems?is applied to the process of changing rules. The last sections examine the capabilities and limits of a series of completely independent resource governance systems and the importance of encouraging the evolution of polycentric governance systems.","1999","2019-06-28 14:47:56","2019-06-28T14:47:56Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19166268",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Progress towards CCD requires multi-stakeholder, multi-sector working and the development of partnerships between actors who may not otherwise have worked together. This creates challenges and opportunities that require careful examination at project and institutional levels and necessitates the sharing of experiences between different settings. In this paper, we draw on the outcomes from a multi-stakeholder workshop held in Mozambique in 2012, the final in a series of activities in a regional project assessing emerging CCD partnerships across southern Africa. The workshop involved policymakers, researchers and representatives from NGOs and the private sector. We employ a content analysis of workshop notes and presentations to identify the progress and challenges in moving four case study countries (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe) towards CCD pathways, by exploring experiences from both project and policy levels. To advance institutional support for the development of successful CCD policies, practices and partnerships, we conclude that there is a need for: (a) institutional development at the national level to strengthen coordination and more clearly define roles and responsibilities across sectors, based on the identification of capacity and knowledge gaps; (b) partnership development, drawing on key strengths and competences of different stakeholders and emphasising the roles of the private sector and traditional authorities; (c) learning and knowledge-sharing through national and regional fora; and (d) development of mechanisms that permit more equitable and transparent distribution of costs and benefits. These factors can facilitate development of multi-stakeholder, multi-level partnerships that are grounded in community engagement from the outset, helping to translate CCD policy statements into on-the-ground action. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2014","2019-06-28 14:47:53","2019-06-28T14:47:53Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 95047379",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Climate change; Community-based development; Mitigation; Multi-sector approaches; Policy; Southern Africa",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I develop a model of two kinds of agents (naive and sophisticated) using two kinds of assets (safe and unsafe) to illustrate the possibility of resource degradation in the commons in the absence of free riding, shirking, and general theft among members of the village and its associated commons. This model makes it possible to understand that degradation of the commons arises from factors outside of the commons rather than arising from 'perverse' property rights and selfish behavior within the commons. This approach suggests a needed reformulation of development assistance away from prescriptions for the commons. Instead, development assistance must be refocused on the more serious challenge of institutional incoherence in the larger economy of which the village and its commons are but a part.","2008","2019-06-28 14:47:48","2019-06-28T14:47:48Z",NA,"539–563","","5",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the new multi-stakeholder partnerships being formed and the factors affecting their outcomes remain poorly understood. This paper aims to identify the characteristics of partnership models that can lead to successful delivery of CCD projects by analyzing case study data from two projects in Zambia. The projects are primarily funded under the umbrella of Corporate Social Responsibility and support activities such as conservation farming which can have carbon storage (mitigation), adaptation and rural development benefits. In each of the case study projects, multiple partnerships have been established between private sector companies, government, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), traditional authorities and community stakeholders to achieve project aims. A new partnership evaluation model is developed and applied to analyze the partnerships formed. Findings show that the rationale behind the partnership, partner-related factors, and process-related factors can all affect achievement of the project's aims. Good practices are identified which can inform future partnerships and projects. For example, when establishing a project, the initiating partner must identify gaps that can be addressed by establishing one or more partnership(s). Careful OPEN ACCESS Resources 2013, 2 2 consideration of which partners can best address these gaps allows for synergies in contributions across the partnership required for successful project implementation. Transparency, openness and communication over roles and responsibilities are key to successful partnerships, and power imbalances between partners will reduce the utilization of each partner's strengths. When working with communities, extra care must be taken to ensure projects are appropriate and relevant to local needs, as well as allowing goals to be met, by engaging communities from the beginning of the project.","2013","2019-06-28 14:47:33","2019-06-28T14:47:33Z",NA,"1–25","","",2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"best practices; climate change; communities; participation; stakeholders; sustainability",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Extreme weather events such as floods and droughts are negatively impacting on agricultural production and other socio-economic sectors in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) region [2]. It is expected that climate change will increase the severity and frequency of these extreme weather events with adverse effects particularly on vulnerable and poor communities.

Biodiversity mainstreaming addresses this gap in global conservation practice by “embedding biodiversity considerations into policies, strategies and practices of key public and private actors that impact or rely on biodiversity, so that it is conserved, and sustainably used, both locally and globally” (Huntley and Redford 2014). Biodiversity mainstreaming is designed to change those policies and practices that influence land uses outside of protected areas as well as to change economic and development decision-making by demonstrating the importance of conserving biodiversity for achieving development outcomes. The practice of mainstreaming is tied to implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and is practiced with billions of dollars of investment by development agencies, national government agencies, and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its implementing organizations as well as other donors. It is essential for the long-term survival of biodiversity inside and outside protected areas. However, it is virtually unheard of in the main conservation science field. This must change so as to bring careful documentation, analysis, monitoring, publishing and improvement of practices – all things that conservation science should provide as partners to practitioners of biodiversity mainstreaming.

Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists.

The effectiveness of this strategy will likely depend on species-specific, population-level responses to logging. We conducted a survey (749 line transects over 3450 km) in logging concessions (1.2 million ha) in the northern Republic of Congo to examine the impact of logging on large mammal populations, including endangered species such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus). When we estimated species abundance without consideration of transect characteristics, species abundances in logged and unlogged forests were not different for most species. When we modeled the data with a hurdle model approach, however, analyzing species presence and conditional abundance separately with generalized additive models and then combining them to calculate the mean species abundance, species abundance varied strongly depending on transect characteristics. The mean species abundance was often related to the distance to unlogged forest, which suggests that intact forest serves as source habitat for several species. The mean species abundance responded nonlinearly to logging history, changing over 30 years as the forest recovered from logging. Finally the distance away from roads, natural forest clearings, and villages also determined the abundance of mammals. Our results suggest that logged forest can extend the conservation estate for many of Central Africa's most threatened species if managed appropriately. In addition to limiting hunting, logging concessions must be large, contain patches of unlogged forest, and include forest with different logging histories.","2009","2019-06-28 14:46:56","2019-06-28T14:46:56Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19453655",NA,NA,NA,"Chimpanzee; Elephant; Generalized additive model; Gorilla; Logging concession; Republic of Congo; Tropical forest",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The paper begins by building on what is believed to be con-cepts common to both fields. In particular, it equates ecosystem services with natural capital, drawing especially on notions of the underpinning nature of ecosystem services as natural capital and suggesting key aspects of social sci-ence that add indispensable value to conservation, as part of a wider recogni-tion of social capital. It is concluded that it is most realistic and productive to regard the world, not as compartmentalised, but as an integrated socio-ecological system. In this regard by way of example, the positive potential of ecotourism in South Africa and how it integrates natural and social capital is contrasted with the negative potential of Invasive Alien Species. This leads to a discussion of South Africa's National Biodiversity Framework as an oppor-tunity to make use of an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation. The mutually beneficial co-existence of people and protected areas is pivotal to any success in this regard and the 'Swi ta Lunga' Trust is discussed as an emerging Integrated Conservation and Development project which has poten-Nick King, Endangered Wildlife Trust, South Africa.","2007","2019-06-28 14:46:52","2019-06-28T14:46:52Z",NA,"88–114","","1",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on the premise that social and ecological systems are linked and cannot be clearly delineated, this volume examines how human societies deal with changes in social ecological systems and consequently, how capacity can be built to adapt to changes and shape them for sustainability. Hence, an emphasis is given on analyzing adaptability to new challenges without compromising sustainability. Resilience is then understood as an organizing concept that brings together the complexity of the two systems, underlining that adaptability and flexibility can improve management processes. The different aspects of resilience on both conceptual and practical level are documented in several case studies that are the core of the volume.","2004","2019-06-28 14:46:50","2019-06-28T14:46:50Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 12684257",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three challenges are highlighted: (1) ensuring the appropriate scope for action; (2) moving beyond intervention-based decision guidance; and (3) developing long-term shared capacity for strategic planning. To overcome these challenges we have applied explorative scenarios and normative back-casting with stakeholders from different sectors at the regional level in East Africa. We then applied lessons about appropriate scope, enabling adaptation pathways, and developing strategic planning capacity to scenarios processes in multiple global regions. Scenarios were created to have a broad enough scope to be relevant to diverse actors, and then adapted by different actor groups to ensure their salience in specific decision contexts. The initial strategy for using the scenarios by bringing a range of actors together to explore new collaborative proposals had limitations as well as strengths versus the application of scenarios for specific actor groups and existing decision pathways. Scenarios development and use transitioned from an intervention-based process to an embedded process characterized by continuous engagement. Feasibility and long-term sustainability could be ensured by having decision makers own the process and focusing on developing strategic planning capacity within their home organizations.","2014","2019-06-28 14:46:45","2019-06-28T14:46:45Z",NA,"383–394","","",28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive pathways; Back-casting; Climate Change; Food System; Scale; Scenarios",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Spatial planning results in actions that may affect the distribution and quality of a wide range of ecosystem services. Hence, spatial planning decisions would benefit from systematic considerations of their effects on ecosystem services. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) provides an excellent platform to this purpose. This paper aims at providing insights on why it is important to promote ecosystem service-inclusive SEA processes, and on how to do it, with particular emphasis on spatial planning. First, possible actions to include relevant information of ecosystem services throughout the SEA process are presented. Second, the advantages are discussed by considering both the characteristics of ecosystem services approaches and the criteria of good-quality SEA. Finally, four main challenges are identified, concerning scoping, scale issues, trade-offs, and indicators, respectively. Addressing these challenges is bound to produce more effective SEA Processes and better planning decision.","2011","2019-06-28 14:46:43","2019-06-28T14:46:43Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the national level, governments utilise scientific, socio-economic and technical data and information for strategic planning, priority setting and national environment and development planning. However, challenges including the lack of capacity and lack of collaboration and sharing of information across governments affect responses to and the effectiveness of monitoring and knowledge exchange, along with the ability to effectively implement treaties. At the international level, a number of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) share cross-sectoral themes related to research and monitoring, information exchange, technology transfer, capacity building and financial resources. The need for increased synergies stems from the similarities between the issues they address. Challenges for improving knowledge management at the international level include insufficient interaction between the scientific bodies of the various MEAs; duplication of reporting, monitoring and assessment efforts; limited knowledge management between the various assessments addressing ecosystems and biological diversity during the past decade; and insufficient collaboration between the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), theUNsystem and the international non-governmental organisation (NGO) community.

Dev","","","10.1002/pad.259","","SUMMARY Decentralisation reforms are taking place across Africa. In decentralisation concerning natural resources, local institutions being chosen to receive powers and the degree and form of power transfers, however, do not establish conditions for more efficient or equitable use and management. A combination of locally accountable representation and discretionary powers are also needed. This combined condition is rarely established. Alternative local institutions are chosen even when democratic local bodies exist. This choice and the failure to transfer discretionary powers can undermine local democratic bodies and con-centrate powers in the executive branch. The choices being made around natural resources appear to reflect a broad resistance of central governments to local democratisation and decentralisation of powers. Five measures may ameliorate the situation: (1) focus first on establishing democratic local government; (2) apply multiple accountability measures, in addition to elections, to support democratic local institutions; (3) engage local populations by transferring discretionary powers before transferring management burdens; (4) transfer powers before capacity building; and (5) shift from an oversight and management-planing model to a minimum-standards model in order to help create greater local autonomy nested within national objectives.",2003,"2019-06-28 14:45:13","2019-06-28T14:45:13Z",NA,"53–65","","","23",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We critically assess the claims made for ""good governance"" reforms in the light of these studies. Altering the scale, and the style, of governance has inevitable consequences for power structures, institutions, livelihoods, and physical landscapes. We offer a framework for analyzing these consequences, focusing on the temporal and scale dimensions of political and environmental decentralization and changes to established modes of governance. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenge is to turn this recognition into incentives and institutions that will guide wise investments in natural capital, on a large scale. Advances are required on three key fronts, each featured here: the science of ecosystem production functions and service mapping; the design of appropriate finance, policy, and governance systems; and the art of implementing these in diverse biophysical and social contexts. Scientific understanding of ecosystem production functions is improving rapidly but remains a limiting factor in incorporating natural capital into decisions, via systems of national accounting and other mechanisms. Novel institutional structures are being established for a broad array of services and places, creating a need and opportunity for systematic assessment of their scope and limitations. Finally, it is clear that formal sharing of experience, and defining of priorities for future work, could greatly accelerate the rate of innovation and uptake of new approaches.",2008,"2019-06-28 14:45:08","2019-06-28T14:45:08Z",NA,"9455–9456","","28","105",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18621697",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Among the more popular initiatives toward this ob- jective is the use of development interventions in the peripheral areas of endangered ecosystems. Such inter- ventions indirectly provide desirable ecosystem services by redirecting labor and capital away from activities that degrade ecosystems (e.g., agricultural intensification) and by encouraging commercial activities that supply ecosystem services asjointproducts (e.g., ecotourism). I examined the economics of such interventions and the available empirical evidence and concluded that development interventions are hindered by (1) the indirect and ambiguous conservation incentives that they generate, (2) the complexity of their implementa- tion, and (3) their lack of conformity with the temporal and spatial dimensions of ecosystem conservation objectives. In contrast, paying individuals or communities directly for conservation performance may be a simpler and more effective approach. In recent years there has been widespread experimentation with con- tracting approaches to ecosystem conservation. Conservation contracting can (1) reduce the set of critical pa- rameters that practitioners must affect to achieve conservation goals, (2) permit more precise targeting and more rapid adaptation over time, and (3) strengthen the links between individual well-being, individual ac- tions, and habitat conservation, thus creating a local stake in ecosystem protection. In situations where per- formancepayments are unlikely to work, indirect development interventions are also unlikely to work. Thus, despite the potential barriers to developing a system of conservation contracts in low-income nations, my analysis suggests that performance payments have the potential to improve the way in which ecosystems are conserved in these nations.

Perceptions on changes in the size structure of groupers differed among communities due to differences in fishing capacities. Fishers in one village had mixed perceptions, while in another village the majority (66%) perceived a decline in size, with small groupers dominating the catch. Similarly, UVCs indicated that size structure was dominated by small groupers at all times surveyed. Consistent with fishers' perceptions, UVC indicated that biomass and abundance of groupers declined in both no-take zones (NTZs) and specified-use zones (SUZs) between 1995 and 2006, with no substantial changes between 2006 and 2011. The NTZs had higher density and diversity of grouper species than SUZs, as would be expected from the differences in bottom topography in these two types of areas. The idea that NTZs could increase the biomass and abundance of groupers to benefit fished zones was not found, thus indicating that NTZs are not necessarily the best option for managing reef fisheries.",2015,"2019-06-28 14:45:02","2019-06-28T14:45:02Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Coral reef fish; Ecological traits; Fisheries management; Fishers' knowledge; No-take zones; Small-scale fisheries",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The corridors involve large-scale expansion of infrastructure such as roads, railroads, pipelines, and port facilities and will open up extensive areas of land to new environmental pressures [1, 4, 8]. We assessed the potential environmental impacts of 33 planned or existing corridors that, if completed, would total over 53,000 km in length and crisscross much of the African continent. We mapped each corridor and estimated human occupancy (using the distribution of persistent night-lights) and environmental values (endangered and endemic vertebrates, plant diversity, critical habitats, carbon storage, and climate-regulation services) inside a 50-km-wide band overlaid onto each corridor. We also assessed the potential for each corridor to facilitate increases in agricultural production. The corridors varied considerably in their environmental values, and many were only sparsely populated. Because of marginal soils or climates, some corridors appear to have only modest agricultural potential. Collectively, the corridors would bisect over 400 existing protected areas and could degrade a further ???1,800 by promoting habitat disruption near or inside the reserves. We conclude that many of the development corridors will promote serious and largely irreversible environmental changes and should proceed only if rigorous mitigation and protection measures can be employed. Some planned corridors with high environmental values and limited agricultural benefits should possibly be cancelled altogether.",2015,"2019-06-28 14:44:50","2019-06-28T14:44:50Z",NA,"1–7","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Elsevier Ltd","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.10.046",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The approach that we develop places the social and economic well-being of society at the centre of the analysis, focussing on the socio-economic and institutional constraints that limit the capacity to respond. From this perspective, the vulnerability or security of any group is determined by resource availability and by the entitlement of individuals and groups to call on these resources. We illustrate the application of this approach through the results of field research in coastal Vietnam, highlighting shifting patterns of vulnerability to tropical storm impacts at the household-and community-level in response to the current process of economic renovation and drawing conclusions concerning means of supporting the adaptive response to climate stress. Four priorities for action are identified that would improve the situation of the most exposed members of many communities: poverty reduction; risk-spreading through income diversification; respecting common property management rights; and promoting collective security. A sustainable response, we argue, must also address the underlying causes of social vulnerability, including the inequitable distribution of resources.",NA,"2019-06-28 14:44:46","2019-06-28T14:44:46Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both kinds of schemes aim to achieve similar conservation outcomes, however, and generally function in analogous social, political and economic environments. Given the relative novelty of PES, what lessons can be learnt and applied from earlier initiatives? In this paper, we describe the evolution over the first 12??years (1989-2001) of Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), a community-based natural resource management programme in which Rural District Councils, on behalf of communities on communal land, are granted the authority to market access to wildlife in their district to safari operators. These in turn sell hunting and photographic safaris to mostly foreign sport hunters and eco-tourists. The District Councils pay the communities a dividend according to an agreed formula. In practice, there have been some underpayments and frequent delays. During 1989-2001, CAMPFIRE generated over US$20 million of transfers to the participating communities, 89% of which came from sport hunting. The scale of benefits varied greatly across districts, wards and households. Twelve of the 37 districts with authority to market wildlife produced 97% of all CAMPFIRE revenues, reflecting the variability in wildlife resources and local institutional arrangements. The programme has been widely emulated in southern and eastern Africa. We suggest five main lessons for emerging PES schemes: community-level commercial transactions can seldom be pursued in isolation; non-differentiated payments weaken incentives; start-up costs can be high and may need to be underwritten; competitive bidding can allow service providers to hold on to rents; and schemes must be flexible and adaptive. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Invasive alien plants are concentrated in the Western Cape, along the eastern seaboard, and into the eastern interior, but there is a shortage of accurate data on abundance within this range. Most information on site-specific impacts comes from the fynbos biome, and is generally poor for other biomes. The consequences of invasions for the delivery of ecosystem goods and services to people are, with the notable exception of their influence on water resources, inadequately studied. Our understanding of many of the broader aspects of invasion ecology needs to be enhanced, andwe identify important challenges for research to address critical gaps in knowledge. Priorities for future research include the development of a predictive understanding of the rates of spread of invasive alien plants, and the development of achievable goals for ecosystem repair after clearing, including measurable criteria for assessing the success of restoration. Climate change could significantly exacerbate problems with invasive species and work is needed to accommodate plausible trajectories in planning and management frameworks. Perhaps the greatest challenge for South African ecologists is to address the twin issues of skills development and social transformation, to ensure that adequate and relevant ecological expertise is maintained to meet future research and management needs. Formal collaboration between organizations to address capacity building and educational transformation in the field of invasion ecology would represent a significant step forward.

Social taboos exist in most cultures, both Western and non-Western. They are good examples of informal institutions, where norms, rather than governmental juridical laws and rules, determine human behavior. In many traditional societies throughout the world, taboos frequently guide human conduct toward the natural environment. Based on a survey of recent literature, we synthesize information on such taboos. We refer to them as ""resource and habitat taboos"" (RHTs). Examples are grouped in six different categories depending on their potential nature conservation and management functions. We compare RHTs with contemporary measures of conservation and identify and discuss some key benefits that may render them useful in partnership designs for conservation and manage-ment. We conclude that many RHTs have functions similar to those of formal institutions for nature conservation in contemporary society but have not been sufficiently recognized in this capacity. We suggest that designs for conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use in developing countries focus more on informal institutions, like social taboos, because they may offer several advantages compared to conventional measures. These include non-costly, voluntary compliance features implicit in the taboo system.",2001,"2019-06-28 14:44:30","2019-06-28T14:44:30Z",NA,"584–600","","22","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"biodiversity; conservation; ecosystem management; informal institutions; natural resource management; resource and habitat taboos (RHTs); sacred groves; social taboos; traditional societies; transaction costs",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analyze the economic impacts of undisturbed natural forest conservation programs on agriculture and the magnitude of avoided deforestation and avoided carbon emissions in the tropics. We apply a global agricultural land use model to estimate changes in agricultural production costs for the period 2015-2055. Our forest conservation scenarios reflect two different policy goals: either maximize forest carbon storage or minimize impacts on agricultural production. In all the scenarios, the economic impacts on agriculture are relatively low. Production costs would increase due to forest conservation by a maximum of 4%, predominantly driven by increased investments in agricultural productivity increase. We also show regional differences in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, due to different growth rates in food demand, land availability and crop productivity. The area of avoided deforestation does not exceed 1.5millionhayr-1in the period 2015-2055, while avoided carbon emissions reach a maximum of 1.9Gt CO2 per year. According to our results on the potential changes in agricultural production costs, undisturbed natural forest conservation appears to be a low-cost option for greenhouse gas emission reduction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:44:27","2019-06-28T14:44:27Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agricultural land expansion; Avoided carbon emissions; Avoided deforestation; Carbon storage; Opportunity costs; Undisturbed natural forest",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the knowledge and methods required to achieve this are often dispersed across individuals and organisations at different levels and locations. Appropriate knowledge management mechanisms are therefore required to more efficiently harness these different sources of knowledge and facilitate their broader dissemination and application. This paper examines what knowledge is, how it is generated and explores how it may be stored, transferred and exchanged between knowledge producers and users before it is applied to monitor and assess land degradation at the local scale. It suggests that knowledge management can also benefit from the development of mechanisms that promote changes in understanding and efficient means of accessing and/or brokering knowledge. Broadly, these processes for knowledge management can (i) help identify and share good practices and build capacity for land degradation monitoring at different scales and in different contexts and (ii) create knowledge networks to share lessons learned and monitoring data among and between different stakeholders, scales and locations. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:44:17","2019-06-28T14:44:17Z",NA,"307–322","","4","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental management; Knowledge brokers; Knowledge exchange; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Land degradation; Monitoring and assessment; Social learning",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While efforts to conserve the island's biological diversity have centred primarily on the designation of protected areas, policies have increasingly focused on local communities. The experiences of the last 20 years have shown that community-based approaches to conservation offer considerable challenges due to the complex politics of natural resource use, which involve multiple and diverse stakeholders, often with very different and sometimes conflicting values. In this paper, I focus on the environmental perceptions and values of two groups in the Central Menabe region of western Madagascar – conservation organisations and rural households – revealing a contrasting set of views regarding the region's forest. I show that the conservation discourse has changed over time, increasingly emphasising the biological diversity of the region's tropical dry-deciduous forest and prioritising non-consumptive uses of natural resources. Although policy has changed in response to changing values, I show that it has been underpinned by the notion that hatsake (‘slash-and-burn' agriculture) is an irrational practice driven by necessity rather than choice. Policy has thus sought to provide livelihood alternatives, firstly through forestry, then through changes in cultivation and increasingly through tourism. This misunderstands the local view of the forest, which sees hatsake as a way to make the land productive, as long as it is carried out responsibly according to local fady (taboos). As well as facing problems of translating conservation goals into local values and misunderstanding the motives for forest clearance, policy has been based on a narrative that attaches particular land use practices to ethnic identities. I argue that this ignores the history and fluid reality of both identity and land use.",2012,"2019-06-28 14:44:10","2019-06-28T14:44:10Z",NA,"67–79","","1","178",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22413174",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental discourse; Ethnic identity; Forest; Madagascar; Political ecology",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Areas of the planet identified as beyond the reliable prediction ability of the model were those having climatic conditions more extreme than what was represented in the ant database.Results Temperature was the most important single predictor of ant species density, and a mix of climatic variables, biogeographic region and interactions between climate and region yielded the best overall model. Broadly, geographic patterns of ant diversity match those of other taxa, with high species density in the wet tropics and in some, but not all, parts of the dry tropics. Uncertainty in model predictions appears to derive from the low amount of standardized sampling of ants in Asia, in Africa and in the most extreme (e.g. hottest) climates. Model residuals increase as a function of temperature. This suggests that our understanding of the drivers of ant diversity at high temperatures is incomplete, especially in hot and arid climates. In other words, our ignorance of how ant diversity relates to environment is greatest in those regions where most species occur – hot climates, both wet and dry.Main conclusions Our results have two important implications. First, temperature is necessary, but not sufficient, to explain fully the patterns of ant diversity. Second, our ability to predict ant diversity is weakest exactly where we need to know the most, the warmest regions of a warming world. This includes significant parts of the tropics and some of the most biologically diverse areas in the world.",2011,"2019-06-28 14:44:05","2019-06-28T14:44:05Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18957298",NA,NA,NA,"Aridity; Biodiversity; Biogeography; Formicidae; Species richness; Temperature",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unfortunately, empirical research on formalisation of tenure as a stimulus to agricultural investment is unable to establish any robust and reliable connection between ""more secure"" tenure and enhanced agricultural productivity. Urban slum dwellers who get titles but who are without work cannot possibly leverage credit from the banking sector. Formalisation erodes and displaces existing social networks and arrangements that do offer security. Formalisation offers little assurance that beneficial outcomes are inevitable.

The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, correctly, favours a more strategic approach to that of conventional, project-level EIA. However, until SEA becomes mandatory, and spatial planning must give effect to conservation priorities, EIA seemingly offers the most pragmatic 'mainstreaming' option in development planning. EIAs can contribute to 'mainstreaming' if: − Systematic conservation plans inform project suitability, planning and assessment; − Habitat loss is evaluated in terms of impacts on conservation targets and ecological processes; and − Development secures biodiversity gains.

By concentrating on marine, coastal, wetlands and forest ecosystems, the focus in this study is on real examples and giving perspective to the substantial literature and on-going research on biodiversity loss taking place at the moment. Biodiversity is crucial to the maintenance of many ecosystem services such as regulation of chemical composition of the atmosphere, food production, supply of raw materials, water provision, nutrients' recycling, biological control of populations of flora and fauna, use of genetic resources, leisure activities and others. Biodiversity continues to decrease at unprecedented rates as human development and expansion result in the fragmentation and loss of habitat for flora and fauna. The loss of biodiversity is expected in most scenario studies to continue at an increasing pace in the coming decades – with projections estimating a decrease from about 70% in 2000 to about 63% by 2050 - as key underlying causes such as economic and market failures are unlikely to be eliminated in the short run. A number of frameworks for assessing the complex interplay of pressures and drivers affecting biodiversity have been developed in the past. The common thread amongst these frameworks is that most of the pressure on biodiversity stems from human-induced disturbance to ecosystems via a number of complicated pathways across different physical and temporal scales. Specific mechanisms whereby biodiversity is lost differ according to biome, geography, climate, type of pressure (i.e. over-exploitation of wildlife as opposed to habitat conversion), economic context in the biodiversity host country, trade patterns, type of governance structure, and other factors. Based on an extensive review of the data relating to pressures and drivers of biodiversity loss, the present study has identified: • the major direct causes of biodiversity loss to be: land use change and conversion of habitat to other land uses, pollution, unsustainable natural resources use, climate change and invasive alien species. • Underlying these causes are failures in governance, appropriate decisionmaking and institutional functioning, as well as economic and market failures. Lack of adequate knowledge and understanding of the processes in ecosystems which conserve biodiversity and provide ecosystem services is pervasive throughout all interference of humans with ecosystems. Naturally, various direct and underlying causes play a more or less significant role depending on the ecosystem under review: • Habitat change, overexploitation as well as nitrogen and phosphorus pollution have had the greatest and an increasing impact on biodiversity loss in forest ecosystems over the past 100 years. • For inland wetlands as well as coastal ecosystems habitat change and pollution have been the most influential drivers for biodiversity loss over the past century. Furthermore, invasive species have also had a high impact on biodiversity in these biomes. • For marine ecosystems on the other hand, over-exploitation has been the single most influential driver of biodiversity loss in the past, followed by habitat change. Evidence of some of these failures is borne out by the examination of forest, marine and coastal ecosystems in developing countries, emerging economies and developed nations in the annex to this study. This study has shown that marine areas suffer the most from a lack of adequate governance structure; and are susceptible to negative effects from economic growth. Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly under threat from the direct effects of climate change and water pollution, made worse by continued urbanisation. Coastal ecosystems suffer from pollution and eutrophication directly while underlying causes are over-population, fast population growth, as well as transport, economic growth and international trade. Forest ecosystems are directly threatened by climate change, land conversion such as agriculture and bio-fuels, infrastructure development, timber extraction and wood-fuel. Underlying causes include economic growth, increasing demand for food and the growth in the international bio-fuels market. Frameworks for mitigating biodiversity loss results are inadequate, i.e. contributing to “unplanned” declines in species and populations. A lack of a systemic approach to capturing the true costs and benefits of ecosystem services, distributing these benefits and allocating conservation resources is common to many of the case studies. Underlying causes such as market failure, externalities and inadequate property rights can result in biodiversity loss even though biodiversity often figures in cost-benefit analyses. Underlying socio-economic factors are usually not taken into account and it usually falls to policy makers to address the issue of biodiversity loss. However, the information policy makers require to make adequate decisions is also often unavailable, too complex or disaggregated, making it extremely difficult to translate policy goals into policy measures. Moreover, poor governance means that much biodiversity is lost due to illegal activity. For example, land use change which is unsanctioned cannot be undone or prevented if institutional controls and mechanisms are inadequate. This is highlighted throughout the Congo Basin forestry case study. It is usually through establishing broader international agreements that foster long-term commitments to maintaining biodiversity or reducing the loss of biodiversity such as the CBD that one can actually start talking about “planned” biodiversity loss and biodiversity conservation. However, conflicting positions of the contracting parties, lack of sufficient data to support negotiations and to establish a level playing field between parties make it difficult for such biodiversity agreements to develop ambitious yet meaningful targets with associated implementation measures. Solutions for the continuing decline in biodiversity need to be developed and implemented as the targets set to stop the decline in biodiversity by 2010 are most likely not going to be reached by the international community. This study identifies some of the possible options to halt and reverse the trend towards decreased levels of biodiversity. Further development of an international market for ecosystem services in which the benefits of ecosystems are captured, valued and paid for to mitigate the negative effects on biodiversity from development projects is one such option. This requires close cooperation between ecologists and economists in order to obtain acceptable valuations of these services, and moreover requires strong institutions to implement regulatory control. Other options for addressing the underlying causes of biodiversity loss can be done using available knowledge and following a process similar to the framework that has developed out of the need to address climate change, i.e. raising awareness of the effects of climate change and its implications for human populations in all countries, underpinned by scientific consensus. The process of raising awareness of the economic, social and environmental value of biodiversity is indeed already underway in Europe, with the TEEB process being an important example. Making sure the value of nature, ecosystems and biodiversity is profiled as highly as climate change has been in recent years will create a global platform from which further development of solutions can be pursued. Yet another approach is to pursue enforcement of current biodiversity policy, and implement conservation strategies and agendas more effectively. Protection of conservation areas (with financial or land compensation for the local/ regional/ national human populations) requires adequate enforcement (somewhat like blue helmet UN interventions against poaching). Moreover, to develop an international payment system of ecosystem services will require control and enforcement. In other words payment of ecosystem services through the World Bank or through regional development banks to those parties affected requires suitable methods for host countries to apply for compensation, control and enforcement. Long-term education of the importance of biodiversity is another option that should be pursued by the international community. Teaching the next generation (including school children and students) about the complexities of the world economy, ecosystem services, ecological footprints and inequality etc. is required to make sure the actions required to stop the halt in biodiversity are met now and in the future. Educational material is plentiful, expertise is available and current staff at schools and universities can easily be trained. However, this approach also requires adequate financing of education in developing countries.",2009,"2019-06-28 14:43:45","2019-06-28T14:43:45Z",NA,"1–206","","October","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although it was first described in 1790, few publications document the ecology or behavior of the species, and none does so for animals in the wild. This vinesnake is unique in displaying high levels of sexual dimorphism and its possession of an elongated nasal appendage, the function of which is not yet understood. The purpose of this study was to obtain information on the natural history of the snake via observations on free-living specimens. The study took place in the quickly disappearing littoral forest of southern Madagascar. I observed six adult males, but found no females. Observations from this study help to elucidate foraging and feeding behavior and activity patterns in L. madagascariensis. With respect to foraging behavior, the vinesnake proved largely to be a sit and wait predator, although it actively pursued prey on some occasions. Contrary to expectations, it consumed both arboreal and terrestrial lizards. One male I observed for several days and nights demonstrated an interesting behavior whereby each night he returned to the same branch and hung from it pointing straight downwards until the morning. These observations help shed light on a little-studied snake that faces high levels of habitat loss.","2012","2019-06-28 14:43:40","2019-06-28T14:43:40Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Feeding ecology; Foraging behavior; Madagascar; Natural history; Sexual dimorphism; Vinesnake",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Examples are grouped in six different categories depending on their potential nature conservation and management functions. We compare RHTs with contemporary measures of conservation and identify and discuss some key benefits that may render them useful in partnership designs for conservation and manage- ment. We conclude that many RHTs have functions similar to those of formal institutions for nature conservation in contemporary society but have not been sufficiently recognized in this capacity. We suggest that designs for conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use in developing countries focus more on informal institutions, like social taboos, because they may offer several advantages compared to conventional measures.

However, mainstreaming has faced a number of interrelated institutional, financial, legal, knowledge and policy barriers. As such, despite 15 years of existence of the UNCCD, successes in reversing and/or preventing land degradation are widely perceived to be limited. This paper highlights the nature of these barriers to mainstreaming and identifies ways in which specific limitations that hamper mainstreaming of land degradation into national, regional and international activities and policies may be overcome. It also identifies institutional infrastructures through which scientific findings may more effectively enter policy, suggesting that scientific bodies are required to strategise, coordinate and stimulate the global scientific research community to support mainstreaming and the up-scaling of efforts to combat land degradation. Such a scientific body could also stimulate national cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder knowledge exchange. The paper then moves to the national level to examine mainstreaming processes in Namibia, a country particularly advanced in taking a more integrated approach. Although the Namibia case study shows an impressive degree of integration, there are still many lessons to be learned in order to further strengthen mainstreaming processes. These lessons form the basis of our conclusion and recommendations, which outline a potential way forward.","2011","2019-06-28 14:43:26","2019-06-28T14:43:26Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1002/ldr.1058",NA,NA,NA,"Desertification; Institutions; Land degradation; Mainstreaming; Policy; Science-policy interface; UNCCD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The resilience and sustainability of related local institutions, however, is influenced by their relationship with external actors and institutions, particularly in facilitating, supporting or hindering local institutional arrangements. From this standpoint, this paper examines the case of local community based institutions involved in wetland management in western Ethiopia. Drawing upon the findings of participatory fieldwork undertaken in eight wetland-using communities of Illubabor and Western Wellega zones in Oromia Region it is argued that although local institutions do play a key role in coordinating wetland management and sustaining the benefits from wetlands, the sustainability and resilience of the institutions themselves is threatened by a range of factors. Despite their grassroots nature, their effectiveness is influenced by their reliance on local government backstopping that appears to have diminished in recent years, as well as a perceived lack of local government support for collective action over individual rights.","2008","2019-06-28 14:43:12","2019-06-28T14:43:12Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ethiopia; Indigenous knowledge; Local institutions; Social capital; Wetland management",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

CAMPFIRE aims to help communities to manage resources, especially wildlife, for their own local developments. The program;s central pbjectives is to alleviate rural poverty by giving rural communities autonomy over resource management and to demonstrate to them that wildlife is not necessarily a hindrance to arable agriculture, ""but a resource that could be managed and 'cultivated' to provide income and food"". In this paper, we assess two importance elements of CAMPFIRE: poverty alleviation and local empowerment and comment on the program's performance in achieving these highly interconnected objectives. We analyze the program's achievements in poverty alleviation by exploring tenurial patterns, resource ownership adn the allocation of proceeds from resource exploitation; and its progress in local empowerment by examining its adminstrative and decision making structures.

Farmers' forecasting knowledge encompasses shared and selective repertoires. Most farmers formulate expectations from observation of natural phenomena. Cultural and ritual spiritualists also predict rainfall from divination, visions, and dreams. Rather than positing local and scienti®c knowledge as self-exclusive, our research shows that farmers operate in multiple cognitive frameworks. Moreover, they are interested in receiving scienti®c information because they perceive local forecasts as becoming less reliable as a result of increasing climate variability. Some aspects of local forecasting knowledge, such as those stressing the relationship between tem-peratures, wind, and rainfall, can help explain meteorology-based forecasts. But signi®cant discordance remains between scienti®c and local forecasts. The former predict total rainfall quantity at a regional scale, whereas the latter stress rainfall duration and distribution and are more attuned to crop±weather interactions. Local systems of thought stress the relationship between knowledge and social responsi-bility. This emphasizes the need for scientists to integrate information dissemination projects with efforts to improve farmers' capacity to respond to forecasts and to cope with suboptimal climate impacts.","2002","2019-06-28 14:42:55","2019-06-28T14:42:55Z",NA,"409–427","","","15",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Burkina Faso; climate variability; environmental indicators; farmer knowledge; indigenous meteorology; seasonal rainfall forecasts 409",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We describe the internal organization and governance of Bonsucro and the process it followed to develop and implement the scheme. We then apply collective action and governance theories to analyze Bonsucro's case and make observations as to how MSIs and alternative governance structures might be organized to address sustainability in global agrifood chains.","2012","2019-06-28 14:42:52","2019-06-28T14:42:52Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Adaptive management is the accepted approach for managing complex SES to ensure their resilience, but unless it is supported by a governance system that is itself adaptive it has little chance of success. Scholars have identified certain principles conducive to adaptive governance. Environmental legislation, an important component of the governance system, is often misaligned with these principles. In this paper we assess adaptive governance principles with regard to legislation governing South Africa's national parks. This assessment indicates that, to enable adaptive governance and adaptive management, legislation should (1) be co-produced by policy-makers, policy implementers and users of protected area ecosystem services; (2) commit and empower management agencies to apply the principles of adaptive governance and adaptive management, particularly in the collaborative development of management plans; (3) commit agencies to review management plans and allow flexibility to adapt plans; (4) ensure that the temporal and spatial scales of the governance system match those of the SES being managed; (5) anticipate change and avoid assumptions of system stability and predictability; and (6) provide for flexible financing mechanisms, so that funds can be prioritised and timed to meet the unpredictable demands of complex systems.","2016","2019-06-28 14:42:40","2019-06-28T14:42:40Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Accountability; Adaptive financing; Adaptive management; Environmental legislation; Knowledge co-production; Protected areas",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The scenario framework is organized around a matrix with two main axes: radiative forcing levels and socio-economic conditions. The radiative forcing levels (and the associated climate signal) are described by the new Representative Concentration Pathways. The second axis, socio-economic developments comprises elements that affect the capacity for mitigation and adaptation, as well as the exposure to climate impacts. The proposed scenarios derived from this framework are limited in number, allow for comparison across various mitigation and adaptation levels, address a range of vulnerability characteristics, provide information across climate forcing and vulnerability states and span a full century time scale. Assessments based on the proposed scenario framework would strengthen cooperation between integrated-assessment modelers, climate modelers and vulnerability, impact and adaptation researchers, and most importantly, facilitate the development of more consistent and comparable research within and across these research communities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2012","2019-06-28 14:42:27","2019-06-28T14:42:27Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 70953283",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Climate change; Climate impacts; Integrated assessment; Mitigation; Scenario analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper aims to better understand the process of creating legitimacy in these Roundtables. The legitimization processes of two cases are analyzed: the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Roundtable on Responsible Soy. From this analysis explanations for the specific development of such a process are derived. The first level of explanation is actor-based and addresses the factors trust and collaborative advantage. The second level refers to institutional factors that provide opportunities and constraints for legitimate interactions to develop, such as the structure of the commodity chain, the type of lead firms in it and the role of governmental policies. The analysis reveals several characteristics of possible legitimization problems and their implications for the application of this governance model.","2012","2019-06-28 14:42:09","2019-06-28T14:42:09Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Legitimacy; Multi-stakeholder governance; Palm oil; Roundtables; Soy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Credit: Morgan Trimble (Accompanying photography at MorganTrimble.com). Bone dry in Majete It was the end of November and the rains were late. The landscape was brown and desolate. The smell of death hung in the 40 ̊ C air at Majete Wildlife Reserve in southern Malawi. With so little vegetation remaining, it was easy to spot the corpses of unfortunate warthog and waterbuck—the most drought sensitive animals— desiccated on the parched earth, stiffened scraps of hide cloaking the outline of their skeletons like old sheets hastily thrown over the furniture in an abandoned house. Park rangers hustled to sniff out and remove the carcasses in the vicinity of Majete's new tourism facilities, the Thawale luxury tented camp, the community campsite, and the Mwembezi restaurant. Much as safari-goers flock to the bar for a cold Carlsberg, waterholes built for game viewing attract the starving animals, desperate for a drink. Many die nearby. Though gloomy, this tale of death triggered by the late rains is only temporary and is an entirely different horror than that transpiring across many of Malawi's conservation areas.","","2019-06-28 14:42:05","2019-06-28T14:42:05Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This essay introduces a collection of ground-breaking studies that discuss responses that range from various types of organized and everyday resistance to demands for incorporation or for better terms of incorporation into land deals. Initiatives ‘from below' in response to land deals have involved local and transnational alliances and the use of legal and extra-legal methods, and have brought victories and defeats. The relevance of political reactions to land grabbing is discussed in light of theories of social movements and critical agrarian studies.

In this paper, focus is on identifying storylines, phrases, myths, and local and indigenous knowledge systems of ethical and ecological significance. Using examples from written and unwritten narratives of Hausa – one of the widely spoken languages in sub-Saharan Africa, this study shines light on some key narratives relevant to present day critical environmental issues such as management of agricultural landscapes, municipal waste, ecosystem services, integrated natural resource management, and biodiversity loss.

"W3X4DWWP","journalArticle",2015,"WWF; African Development Bank","African ecological futures 2015","","","","","","The past decade and a half has seen many countries sustain growth rates of five per cent and above. As the continent opens up to futuristic prospects, the narrative is rightly beginning to question the extent to which Africa's growth is sustainably transforming livelihoods while lifting millions from abject poverty. While celebrating Africa's huge and diverse natural resource base, this report equally recognizes the continent's rich ecosystems – and the role both play in economic development. It notes that the current development trajectories and choices made by African countries both individually and collectively will have direct impacts on people and nature. These impacts will touch not only on inclusivity but also on the sustainability of the natural resources and ecosystem services that anchor economic growth. The report shares well examined perspectives of the pressures and drivers of Africa's economic fortunes over the next 50 years. It provides detailed analysis of population trends, urbanization, changing consumption patterns, investment levels as well as the role of the global economy in both African agriculture and extractives. Trends in these areas, as well as in those in the infrastructure domain, will have implications on the quality and ecological sustainability of Africa's growth. It is our conviction that appreciation of the development trajectories and their relationship with primary resources; the water -agriculture-energy-extractives nexus and their impacts on natural resource endowments, is critically important for planning for inclusivity and sustainability. It is pertinent to consider what Africa's economic development means for its ecological systems. Development planners must take these implications into account to ensure sustainable outcomes.

LCC was conducted using orthorectified Landsat multi-temporal imagery for 1970/1972, 1986/1987, 2000/2001 and 2006 using maximum likelihood classification and change detection techniques. The results showed a decrease in the forest area and an increase in built-up and cultivation/others (open space, bare land, grassland) areas. Between 1972 and 2006, forest reduced by about 50% while built-up areas increased by about 300%. A Participatory Learning Approach (PLA) involving experienced elderly local experts above 65 years old was conducted to assess their observations in the region on (i) LCC and (ii) the causes of water shortage, and (iii) the associated risk and adaptation/recommendation. The communities' local experts reported that changes in climatic condition, deforestation in the last 30 years and constructions of surface storages (reservoirs) are the major factors responsible for declining surface water in the region. There is thus, a good corroboration between the results of remotely sensed data of LCC assessment and the communities' local experts' observations of land cover changes and changes in surface water resources in the region. The study therefore inferred that LCC map products-information could be used in a participatory approach involving the communities to assess the impact of environmental change on an important service of forest ecosystems such as fresh water resources.","2016","2019-06-28 14:41:35","2019-06-28T14:41:35Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental changes; Local experts; Perceptions; SW-Nigeria; Surface water; Vegetation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"VXTZ8HLB","journalArticle",NA,"","FOREWORD AfDB & WWF","","","","","","The past decade and a half has seen many countries sustain growth rates of five per cent and above. As the continent opens up to futuristic prospects, the narrative is rightly beginning to question the extent to which Africa's growth is sustainably transforming livelihoods while lifting millions from abject poverty. While celebrating Africa's huge and diverse natural resource base, this report equally recognizes the continent's rich ecosystems – and the role both play in economic development. It notes that the current development trajectories and choices made by African countries both individually and collectively will have direct impacts on people and nature. These impacts will touch not only on inclusivity but also on the sustainability of the natural resources and ecosystem services that anchor economic growth. The report shares well examined perspectives of the pressures and drivers of Africa's economic fortunes over the next 50 years. It provides detailed analysis of population trends, urbanization, changing consumption patterns, investment levels as well as the role of the global economy in both African agriculture and extractives. Trends in these areas, as well as in those in the infrastructure domain, will have implications on the quality and ecological sustainability of Africa's growth. It is our conviction that appreciation of the development trajectories and their relationship with primary resources; the water -agriculture-energy-extractives nexus and their impacts on natural resource endowments, is critically important for planning for inclusivity and sustainability. It is pertinent to consider what Africa's economic development means for its ecological systems. Development planners must take these implications into account to ensure sustainable outcomes. This report has systematically treated this very fluid and dynamic subject by considering and analyzing critical drivers of various economic objectives in key development sectors that will steer Africa's progress in the next 50 years and beyond.","","2019-06-28 14:41:34","2019-06-28T14:41:34Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is the type of adaptation that aims to combine these outcomes and is particularly relevant to developing nations that safeguard most of the planetary biodiversity and healthy ecosystems. Although conceptually new, ecosystem-based adaptation is fastly gaining traction both as a research arena and as an integrated policy instrument. This paper aims to revisit this concept and to discuss the science and policy challenges faced by it. It argues that ecosystem-based adaptation is a policy mix that promotes adaptive transition, which is a step towards sustainability transitions. It faces two major challenges in promoting transitions towards adaptation and sustainability. First, research on ecosystem-based adaptation mostly takes place within the socio-ecological systems framework, which is often carried out in isolation from socio-technical systems research. It is widely recognized that both types of research should be integrated, for the benefit of science and policy-making, and the paper discusses the potential of ecosystem-based adaptation in providing such bridge. Second, there is a divide between global and local research and policy, while at local level this divide is related to the setting (e.g., coastal, urban, rural). The resulting mosaic of information lacks integration, which hinders scalability of actions and policies. Finally, I examine the opportunity for ecological and conservation scientists to interact with social, economic and political scientists on ecosystem-based adaptation research, and discuss how timely this opportunity is for Brazil.",2017,"2019-06-28 14:41:29","2019-06-28T14:41:29Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1016/j.pecon.2017.05.003",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive transition; Ecosystem services; Nature-based solutions; Policy mix; Sustainability transitions",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is inspired by two landmark documents of the United Nations (UN) – the Brundtland Commission's report, Our Common Future, and Agenda 21 – and Africa's own vision of renaissance. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission advised that: “The downward spiral of poverty and environmental degradation is a waste of opportunities and of resources. What is needed now is a new era of economic growth – growth that is forceful and at the same time socially and environmentally sustainable” (WCED1987). Echoing this approach the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), in its environmental programme of action, Agenda 21 reaffirmed the links between environment and development, drawing attention to the fundamental connection between environmental goods-and-services and human well-being: “Integration of environment and development concerns and greater attention to them will lead to the fulfilment of basic needs, improved living standards for all, better protected and managed ecosystems and a safer, more prosperous future” (UN 1992). Building on this vision, Africa Environment Outlook 2 – Our Environment, Our Wealth (AEO-2) profiles Africa's environmental resources as an asset for the region's development. The assessment highlights the opportunities presented by the natural resource base to support development and the objectives of the African Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). The report reaffirms the need for sustainable livelihoods, and the importance of environmental initiatives in supporting them. The emphasis is put on what should and can be done with existing (remaining) environmental assets, in the context of identified constraints (issues), rather than focusing on what has been (already) lost. The following are particularly illustrated: ● adding value to the resource that still exists (or remains); ● using natural resources efficiently (and sustainably) to derive maximum benefit ; ● mitigating the constraints and negative effects; ● maximizing the total value of Africa's natural assets; ● making a case for safeguarding and improving the remaining assets; and ● converting the current environmental challenges into opportunities for development.",2006,"2019-06-28 14:41:23","2019-06-28T14:41:23Z",NA,"","146","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both kinds of schemes aim to achieve similar conservation outcomes, however, and generally function in analogous social, political and economic environments. Given the relative novelty of PES, what lessons can be learnt and applied from earlier initiatives? In this paper, we describe the evolution over the first 12 years (1989-2001) of Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), a community-based natural resource management programme in which Rural District Councils, on behalf of communities on communal land, are granted the authority to market access to wildlife in their district to safari operators. These in turn sell hunting and photographic safaris to mostly foreign sport hunters and eco-tourists. The District Councils pay the communities a dividend according to an agreed formula. In practice, there have been some underpayments and frequent delays. During 1989-2001, CAMPFIRE generated over US$20 million of transfers to the participating communities, 89% of which came from sport hunting. The scale of benefits varied greatly across districts, wards and households. Twelve of the 37 districts with authority to market wildlife produced 97% of all CAMPFIRE revenues, reflecting the variability in wildlife resources and local institutional arrangements. The programme has been widely emulated in southern and eastern Africa. We suggest five main lessons for emerging PES schemes: community-level commercial transactions can seldom be pursued in isolation; non-differentiated payments weaken incentives; start-up costs can be high and may need to be underwritten; competitive bidding can allow service providers to hold on to rents; and schemes must be flexible and adaptive. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

According to fishers' LEK, the bluefish spawn mainly during the winter, migrate throughout year (from the South to North), and eat mainly small fish (Clupeidae and Engraulidae), plus shrimp and squid. The biological survey confirmed the hypothesis on bluefish diet (78% of fish with stomach contents had fish in their stomachs) but not that on reproduction: we observed larger fish and more fish with visible eggs during summer and autumn. Migratory move- ments mentioned by fishers agreed with literature data.

Only about 31% of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity, with 14% access rate in rural areas. Compounding the challenge, traditional biomass supplies up to 85% of primary energy supply, and accounts for 80% of energy consumption. With limited energy efficiency, installed generation capacity and weak institutions and energy sector governance, energy security in Africa has become a critical concern. Adaptation to climate change is another challenge to sustainable development in Africa. Even though Africa contributes less than 4% of global GHG emissions, it is disproportionately affected by climate change effects such as food security, water supply, biodiversity, climate- related diseases and other such effects. Energy and climate change are however related, as much of the GHG emissions are related to the way society produces, distributes and consumes energy. This connection offers a policy opportunity that can allow the achievement of energy security goals in a sustainable manner, and in less carbon-intensive ways. The joint exploration of policies that can spur clean energy development that have inherent climate change mitigation benefits is the main focus of this paper. Renewable energy technology adoption can lead to larger mitigation outcomes while enhancing access to clean energy. While coal- and fossil fuel-based energy production emit significant carbon per unit of energy generated, hydro, bioenergy, wind and solar thermal and PV technologies offer carbon-neutral energy generation opportunities. Therefore, reducing barriers to renewable energy development through innovative public policy should interest energy and climate policymakers. Such policies as net metering, feed-in tariff, renewable energy portfolios, voluntary targets, production tax credits and fiscal incentives are shown to encourage clean energy development. To advance integrated renewable energy and climate change adaptation/ mitigation policies in Africa, this paper recommends policies and strategies, including: (1) establishment of clear energy and climate change adaptation/mitigation policies in Africa; (2) implementation of renewable energy development-inducing policies; (3) creating conducive environments for private-public partnerships in clean energy development; (4) enhancement of broader regional and continental collaboration in energy and climate change policies; (5) accessing existing international funding sources for promoting less carbon-intensive energy technologies; and (6) implementation of energy portfolio diversification. As African countries seek to develop their energy sector, renewable energy offers a great opportunity. Recognising the links between energy security and climate change, integrative policies that advance energy development through less carbon-intensive technologies will remain to be valuable. Energy and climate change policymakers and stakeholders are encouraged to promote such innovative policies to meet energy and climate change challenges in the 21st century",2011,"2019-06-28 14:40:45","2019-06-28T14:40:45Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is, therefore, a great need within emerging global assessment programs, such as the IPBES and other international efforts, to develop functioning mechanisms for legitimate, transparent, and constructive ways of creating synergies across knowledge systems. We present the multiple evidence base (MEB) as an approach that proposes parallels whereby indigenous, local and scientific knowledge systems are viewed to generate different manifestations of knowledge, which can generate new insights and innovations through complementarities.

The complexity of using rules as tools to change the struc- ture of commons dilemmas is then discussed, drawing on extensive research on rules in field settings. Viewing all policies as experiments with a probabil- ity of failure, recent research on a different form of general organiza- tion—that of complex adaptive systems—is applied to the process of chang- ing rules.

Trophodynamic indicators are needed to measure the strength of the interactions between the different living components, and of structural ecosystem changes resulting from exploitation. We review trophodynamic indicators derived from models, as well as from emergent patterns such as trophic cascades and regime shifts. From 46 indicators identified in the literature, six (catch or biomass ratios, primary production required to support catch, production or consumption ratios and predation mortality, trophic level of the catch, fishing-in-balance, and mixed trophic impact) were selected because of their ability to reveal ecosystem-level patterns, and because they match published criteria. This suite of indicators is applied to the northern and southern Benguela ecosystems, and their performance is evaluated to depict drastic and contrasted ecosystem changes. A few complementary indicators are suggested as needed to detect the trophodynamic impacts of fisheries and ecosystem changes. Trends in indicators are sensitive to the choice of trophic level made for certain species. Trophodynamic indicators appear to be conservative, because they respond slowly to large structural changes in an ecosystem. Application of the selected indicators to other marine ecosystems is encouraged so as to evaluate fully their usefulness to an ecosystem approach to fisheries, and to establish international comparability. © 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, seeks to ensure international wildlife trade is sustainable, relying on trade bans and controls. However, there has been little comprehensive review of its effectiveness and here we review approaches taken to regulate wildlife trade in CITES. Although assessing its effectiveness is problematic, we assert that CITES boasts few measurable conservation successes. We attribute this to: non-compliance, an over reliance on regulation, lack of knowledge and monitoring of listed species, ignorance of market forces, and influence among CITES actors. To more effectively manage trade we argue that interventions should go beyond regulation and should be multi-faceted, reflecting the complexity of wildlife trade. To inform these interventions we assert an intensive research effort is needed around six key areas: (1) factors undermining wildlife trade governance at the national level, (2) determining sustainable harvest rates for, and adaptive management of CITES species, (3) gaining the buy-in of local communities in implementing CITES, (4) supply and demand based market interventions, (5) means of quantifying illicit trade, and (6) political processes and influence within CITES.",2015,"2019-06-28 14:40:18","2019-06-28T14:40:18Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1016/j.gecco.2014.11.010",NA,NA,NA,"CITES; Community conservation; Compliance; Economics; Regulation; Wildlife trade",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The risk of collapse also requires adjustments to NDP, as any capital revaluation associated with ecosystem conversionmust be adjusted for this risk, and the discounted minimum value of ecosystems associated with collapse must be subtracted from NDP.

Three challenges are highlighted: (1) ensuring the appropriate scope for action; (2) moving beyond intervention-based decision guidance; and (3) developing long-term shared capacity for strategic planning. To overcome these challenges we have applied explorative scenarios and normative back-casting with stakeholders from different sectors at the regional level in East Africa. We then applied lessons about appropriate scope, enabling adaptation pathways, and developing strategic planning capacity to scenarios processes in multiple global regions. Scenarios were created to have a broad enough scope to be relevant to diverse actors, and then adapted by different actor groups to ensure their salience in specific decision contexts. The initial strategy for using the scenarios by bringing a range of actors together to explore new collaborative proposals had limitations as well as strengths versus the application of scenarios for specific actor groups and existing decision pathways. Scenarios development and use transitioned from an intervention-based process to an embedded process characterized by continuous engagement. Feasibility and long-term sustainability could be ensured by having decision makers own the process and focusing on developing strategic planning capacity within their home organizations.",2014,"2019-06-28 14:40:14","2019-06-28T14:40:14Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation pathways; Back-casting; Climate change; Food systems; Scale; Scenarios",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Following a review of the challenges associated with knowledge integration, we present a series of questions for identifying, engaging, evaluating and applying different knowledges during project design and delivery. These questions are used as a basis to compare three environmental management projects that aimed to integrate knowledge from different sources in the United Kingdom, Solomon Islands and Australia. Comparative results indicate that integrating different types of knowledge is inherently complex - classification of knowledge is arbitrary and knowledge integration perspectives are qualitatively very different. We argue that there is no single optimum approach for integrating local and scientific knowledge and encourage a shift in science from the development of knowledge integration products to the development of problem-focussed, knowledge integration processes.

Economics provides a useful perspective on issues of biodiversity, at three levels. At the international level, governments may need to consider the impact of global economic policies, such as commodities prices, on bio-diversity; and because the conservation of biodiversity provides global economic benefits, economic incentives should be provided to governments at the international level (for example, through the Global Environment Facility, but also through terms of trade). At the national level, governments need to be able to assess the impact of their policies on the biological resources of the country, and consider the utility of using a combination of economic incentives (such as differential access to resources, compensation for animal damage, subsidies and grants) and economic disincentives (such as fines and withholding of benefits) to promote conservation objectives. Govern-ments need to address, the problem of ""perverse in-centives"" -economic instruments which promote the destruction of biodiversity. Many government subsidies and foreign assistance projects have had such effects. At the level of government agencies responsible for conserv-ing biodiversity, incentives can often be used to enhance the performance of staff, improve relations with surround-ing communities, and provide long-term financial support to the agency. Examples from throughout Africa are pro-vided to show how economic incentives can enable governments and the private sector to support national conservation objectives more efficiently than can tradi-tional regulatory approaches.",1993,"2019-06-28 14:40:03","2019-06-28T14:40:03Z",NA,"144–150","","2",223,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Accounting for ecosystems and their services leads to adjusting net domestic product (NDP) for the direct benefits provided by the current stock of ecosystems but not for their indirect contributions in terms of protecting or sup- porting economic activity, property and human lives.When ecosystems are irreversibly converted for economic development,NDP must be furthermodified to reflect any capi- tal revaluation that occurs with the current conversion of ecological capital to other land uses. The risk of collapse also requires adjustments to NDP, as any capital revaluation associated with ecosystem conversionmust be adjusted for this risk, and the discounted minimum value of ecosystems associated with collapse must be subtracted from NDP. These various contributions of ecological capital to wealth accounts are illustrated with the example of mangroves in Thailand over the period 1970–2009.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:39:48","2019-06-28T14:39:48Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dans son étude, plus sommaire, que nous signalons aujourd'hui, l'auteur poursuit ses recherches en la matière du contrat et en approfondit certains aspects. La phrase expressive du doyen René Savatier, « elle était si belle et si simple, la notion de contrat dans le Code civil ! » (2), constitue le point de départ de l'analyse entreprise par M. Kramer. Il constate que dans tous les pays ayant adopté la conception libérale du contrat, à l'heure actuelle on parle fréquemment de la crise du contrat, sans chercher cependant à définir la nature de cette crise ni les moyens d'y remédier. L'auteur précise qu'il n'entend pas procéder à un examen de la crise du système dogmatique de la matière du contrat, crise qui résulte du problème de faire entrer dans le système du contrat des phénomènes juridiques essentiellement différents de ce dernier, tels que, à titre d'exemple, les conditions générales ou les rapports juridiques de fait (faktische Vertragsverhältnisse). Laissant au second plan les considérations d'ordre dogmatique, M. Kramer cherche à révéler le fond idéologique de ce système et à explorer les possibilités d'une réforme progressive (evolutionär) de la matière du contrat. Ces deux problèmes constituent respectivement l'objet des deux principaux chapitres (numérotés par les lettres B et C) de ce travail. Il convient de signaler, dans le premier, notamment la section portant sur la liberté contractuelle et la justice contractuelle (p. 19 et s.), et, dans le second, celle consacrée aux « frontières immanentes » de la liberté contractuelle (p. 48 et s.) ; dans cette dernière le lecteur trouvera entre autres un résumé analytique de la position prise sur ce point par un certain nombre d'auteurs bien connus (Esser, L.

Macrez. — Droit de la protection de la nature et de l' environnement, Paris, Librairie générale de droit et de jurisprudence, 1973, 974 pages. Cet ouvrage était attendu par tous. Véritable traité du droit de l'environnement, il constitue la source la plus complète du droit positif français. L'auteur, dans son avant-propos, semble s'excuser de ne faire en la matière qu'un ouvrage de droit, c'est là son mérite le plus grand. Il fallait que tous ceux qui prétendent lutter pour la défense de l' environnement puissent connaître avec le plus grand détail tous les textes et la jurisprudence. On est quelque peu pris de vertige en constatant que notre pays dispose de tant d'instruments juridiques, il semble que tout soit prévu et réglementé. En réalité, les règles juridiques sont trop nombreuses pour être efficaces. Après avoir étudié les institutions de l'environnement au niveau central et local, le professeur Lamarque divise son ouvrage en deux parties consacrées respectivement à la protection de la nature d'une part et à la lutte contre les nuisances d'autre part.

Two approaches are commonly used to sustain biodiversity in National Parks. Past and current studies show that both approaches are generally ineffective in conserving biodiversity in National Parks in Africa. However, there are a handful of cases where these approaches have been successful at conserving biodiversity in National Parks. The question this paper attempts to answer is why in some cases these approaches have been successful and in other cases they have failed. A metadata analysis of 123 documents on case studies about conservation of biodiversity in National Parks in Africa was conducted. A series of search engines were used to find papers for review. Results showed that all factors responsible for both the success and failure of conserving biodiversity in National Parks in various contexts were socioeconomic and cultural in nature. The highest percentage in both successful case studies (66%) and unsuccessful cases studies (55%) was associated with the creation and management of the park. These results suggest that future conservation approaches in National Parks in Africa should place more emphasis on the human dimension of biodiversity conservation than purely scientific studies of species and habitats in National Parks.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:39:44","2019-06-28T14:39:44Z",NA,"","","",20,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A system of prohibitions known as fady is central to Malagasy culture. We examined whether fady that relate to the use of natural resources in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar play an important conservation role. Prohibitions ranged from strict taboos in which a species or area was forbidden by the ancestors to social norms that concerned acceptable behavior when harvesting wild species. Strict taboos offered real protection to threatened species, such as the lemur Propithecus edwardsi and the carnivore Cryptoprocta ferox. Taboos also reduced pressure on some economically important endemic species by preventing their sale or limiting the harvest season. Despite their value for conservation, the taboos did not appear to originate from attempts to sustainably manage resources. Nevertheless, social norms, in which the sanction was social disapproval rather than supernatural retribution, encouraged sustainable harvesting practices for tenrecs (Tenrec ecudatus) and pandans (Pandanus spp.). Unfortunately, the social norms concerning methods of harvesting pandans appeared to be breaking down in villages surrounding Ranomafana National Park, and we suggest that the imposition of external conservation rules is weakening traditional management. Informal institutions are important to conservation because they suggest ways of improving cultural understanding and conservation communication. Food taboos influence societal preferences, which affect the wider demand for a species. Most important, where capacity to enforce external conservation rules is limited, informal institutions may provide the only effective regulations. Informal institutions should receive greater attention from conservation biologists so that local people's conservation roles can be acknowledged fairly and so that potential synergies with conservation objectives can be realized.","2008-08","2019-06-28 14:39:32","2019-06-28T14:39:32Z",NA,"976–86",NA,"4","22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18616743",NA,NA,NA,"Ranomafana National Park; co-management; community-based conservation; culture; customs; fady; taboos",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In conse-quence, there has been a conspicuous surge in direct investment in agricultural land over the past couple of years. Dubbed 'land grabs' in the media, these investments have kindled much international debate, in which strong positions are taken on the impacts of such investments on environment, rights, sovereignty, livelihoods, development and conflict at local, national and international levels. An analysis of this complex and shifting situation, focusing on Africa, lays out key trends, drivers and main features, and outlines how to make the renewed momentum in agricultural investment work for development and avoid the pitfalls of exacer-bated political tensions. 1 International land acquisition: trends and drivers Large-scale international land acquisitions have been much in the news over the past year. 2 Amid the fanfare, what have been less available are quantitative assessments * International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).

The study involved analysis of a small sample of contracts, in-depth case studies in Mozambique and Tanzania, and quantitative national inventories of agricultural land acquisitions over 1,000ha from 1 Jan. 2004 to 31 March 2009 in Ethio-pia, Ghana, Madagascar and Mali. The inventories relied primarily on host government sources (such as invest-ment promotion agencies and ministries for agriculture), cross-checked through multi-stakeholder interviews.","2009","2019-06-28 14:39:28","2019-06-28T14:39:28Z",NA,"1233–1247",NA,"6","85",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

GPI adjusts for income distribution effects, the value of household and volunteer work, costs of mobility and pollution, and the depletion of social and natural capital. ISEW or GPI have been estimated for several countries around the world and a few Canadian provinces, but we report here on the first multi-scale application at the city, county and state levels in Vermont, USA. We show that it is feasible to apply the GPI approach at these smaller scales and to compare across scales and with the national average. Data limitations and problems still exist, but potential solutions to these problems also exist. All three Vermont scales had significantly higher GPI per capita since 1980 than the national average, indicating the major differences that can exist within countries. The GPI per capita for all Vermont scales was similar to the national average in the 1950-1980 period, but more than twice the national average by 2000. The main factors explaining this difference had to do with Vermont's much better environmental performance than the national average in the post-1980 period. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We, the people of Africa and her Diaspora, united in diversity, young and old, men and women, girls and boys from all walks of life, deeply conscious of history, express our deep appreciation to all generations of Pan-Africanists. In particular, to the founders of the Organisation of African Unity for having bequeathed us an Africa with exemplary successes in the fight against slavery, colonialism and apartheid. Agenda 2063, rooted in Pan Africanism and African Renaissance, provides a robust framework for addressing past injustices and the realisation of the 21st Century as the African Century. 2. We echo the Pan-African call that Africa must unite in order to realize its Renaissance. Present generations are confident that the destiny of Africa is in their hands, and that they must act now to shape the future they want. Fifty years after the first thirty-three (33) independent African states took a landmark decision to form the Organization of African Unity, we are looking ahead towards the next fifty years. 3. In this new and noble initiative, past plans and commitments have been reviewed, and we pledge to take into account lessons from them as we implement Agenda 2063. These include: mobilization of the people and their ownership of continental programmes at the core; the principle of self-reliance and Africa financing its own development; the importance of capable, inclusive and accountable states and institutions at all levels and in all spheres; the critical role of Regional Economic Communities as building blocks for continental unity; taking into account of the special challenges faced by both island and land-locked states; and holding ourselves and our governments and institutions accountable for results. Agenda 2063 will not happen spontaneously, it will require conscious and deliberate efforts to nurture a transformative leadership that will drive the agenda and defend Africa's interests.","2015","2019-06-28 14:39:16","2019-06-28T14:39:16Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper explores the methods, costs, and benefits of developing and linking scenarios of social-ecological systems across multiple spatial scales. Drawing largely on experiences in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, we suggest that the desired degree of cross-scale linkage depends on the primary aim of the scenario exercise. Loosely linked multiscale scenarios appear more appropriate when the primary aim is to engage in exploratory dialog with stakeholders. Tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios seem to work best when the main objective is to further our understanding of cross-scale interactions or to assess trade-offs between scales. The main disadvantages of tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios are that their development requires substantial time and financial resources, and that they often suffer loss of credibility at one or more scales. The reasons for developing multiscale scenarios and the expectations associated with doing so therefore need to be carefully evaluated when choosing the desired degree of cross-scale linkage in a particular scenario exercise.","2007","2019-06-28 14:39:15","2019-06-28T14:39:15Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 732279",NA,NA,NA,"Cross-scale scenarios; Environmental assessment; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment; Multiscale scenarios; Scenario analysis; Stakeholder engagement",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Countries generally tax the forestry sector to achieve the twin objectives of revenue maximization and sustainability of logging levels. In an ideal world of perfect markets and information, auctions would be the best instrument to determine the price of extraction rights. However, a number of factors—including a lack of information on the forest resources under consideration, uncertainties as to the stability of property rights over time, and a lack of access to credit—have limited the use of auctions so far, particularly in low-income countries. To establish transparency of the forestry sector's financial flows, this paper discusses a radical simplification of Liberia's current timber tax structure, including a proposal to reduce the sector's current tax system to two instruments, an area tax and an export tax.","2005","2019-06-28 14:39:10","2019-06-28T14:39:10Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; H20; JEL Classification Numbers; Liberia; O55 Keywords; Q23; forestry; taxation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of “bridging organizations” seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts.

The paper is based on an empirical analysis of interviews with 32 researchers and stakeholders across 13 environmental management research projects, each of which included elements of knowledge co-creation and sharing in their design. The projects focused on a range of upland and catchment management issues across the UK, and included Research Council, Government and NGO funded projects. Preliminary findings were discussed with knowledge exchange professionals and academic experts to ensure the emerging principles were as broadly applicable as possible across multiple disciplines. The principles suggest that: knowledge exchange needs to be designed into research; the needs of likely research users and other stakeholders should be systematically represented in the research where possible; and long-term relationships must be built on trust and two-way dialogue between researchers and stakeholders in order to ensure effective co-generation of new knowledge. We found that the delivery of tangible benefits early on in the research process helps to ensure continued motivation and engagement of likely research users. Knowledge exchange is a flexible process that must be monitored, reflected on and continuously refined, and where possible, steps should be taken to ensure a legacy of ongoing knowledge exchange beyond initial research funding. The principles have been used to inform the design of knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement guidelines for two international research programmes. They are able to assist researchers, decision-makers and other stakeholders working in contrasting environmental management settings to work together to co-produce new knowledge, and more effectively share and apply existing knowledge to manage environmental change.","2014","2019-06-28 14:38:53","2019-06-28T14:38:53Z",NA,"337–345",NA,"","146",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25194520",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental management; Knowledge exchange; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Knowledge translation; Research; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder participation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given the increases in extreme weather events projected to affect the Southern Africa region, it is essential to assess how household and community-level adaptations have been helped or hindered by institutional structures and national policy instruments. In particular, there is a need to reflect on efforts related to the United Nations' environmental conventions to ensure that policies support the maintenance of local adaptations and help retain the resilience of socio-economic and environmental systems. This paper examines three interlinked drivers of adaptation: climate change, desertification and drought, assessing the extent to which international and national policy supports local adaptive strategies in three countries in southern Africa. We show that while common ground exists between desertification and climate change adaptations at the policy level, they are insufficiently mainstreamed within broader development approaches. Similarly, there are some overlaps between policy-driven and autonomous local adaptations, but the mutually supportive links between them are poorly developed. Further efforts to integrate local adaptation strategies within policy could increase local resilience to environmental change, while also contributing to wider development goals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, incentives cannot work if people do not know about them, if they are inappropriate or if they are delivered in insufficient quantities. In southern African CBNRM initiatives, many incentives are offered, particularly jobs and community income from hunting and photographic tourism activities. There is a need to assess - jointly - residents' knowledge and perceptions of these incentives and their actual delivery to determine whether they are likely to be effective in sustaining participation in CBNRM activities over the long run. This paper reports the results of just such an assessment at two CBNRM sites, the Tchuma Tchato project in Mozambique and Kwandu Conservancy in Namibia. While different types of benefits were delivered at both sites, they were largely of low value and low in volume. It appears that the incentives offered are not inappropriate, but are insufficient - too few people benefit directly and the level of benefits is generally too small. Further, a large minority of households feel benefits have been inequitably distributed and that the direct costs of living with wildlife have been ineffectively addressed. These issues should be viewed as potentially serious challenges to maintaining local participation in CBNRM activities in the long run. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","2013","2019-06-28 14:38:49","2019-06-28T14:38:49Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Community based natural resource management; Equity; Incentives; Mozambique; Namibia; Perceptions",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the new multi-stakeholder partnerships being formed and the factors affecting their outcomes remain poorly understood. This paper aims to identify the characteristics of partnership models that can lead to successful delivery of CCD projects by analyzing case study data from two projects in Zambia. The projects are primarily funded under the umbrella of Corporate Social Responsibility and support activities such as conservation farming which can have carbon storage (mitigation), adaptation and rural development benefits. In each of the case study projects, multiple partnerships have been established between private sector companies, government, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), traditional authorities and community stakeholders to achieve project aims. A new partnership evaluation model is developed and applied to analyze the partnerships formed. Findings show that the rationale behind the partnership, partner-related factors, and process-related factors can all affect achievement of the project's aims. Good practices are identified which can inform future partnerships and projects. For example, when establishing a project, the initiating partner must identify gaps that can be addressed by establishing one or more partnership(s). Careful consideration of which partners can best address these gaps allows for synergies in contributions across the partnership required for successful project implementation. Transparency, openness and communication over roles and responsibilities are key to successful partnerships, and power imbalances between partners will reduce the utilization of each partner's strengths. When working with communities, extra care must be taken to ensure projects are appropriate and relevant to local needs, as well as allowing goals to be met, by engaging communities from the beginning of the project.","2013","2019-06-28 14:38:40","2019-06-28T14:38:40Z",NA,"1–25",NA,"1","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"best practices; climate change; communities; participation; stakeholders; sustainability",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An area of 1400 ha was rented to investors for agriculture and livestock-keeping. These activities caused contamination of the water sources which feed a water supply scheme managed by a downstream local community and serving a population of 45,000. While there are mechanisms within Tanzanian law to limit potentially polluting activities, establish protected zones around water sources and empower water user organisations to exercise control over activities that damage the quality of water, in practice, in the Iringa region, these were not effective as many procedures were not followed. This paper examines the cause of this, the effect that these failures had on downstream access to safe drinking water and the subsequent (largely successful) process of correcting the damage done. The paper discusses the direct causes of water contamination (the use of fertilisers and pesticides and the presence of cattle) and the indirect causes (unclear administrative boundaries, lack of participation and transparency, procedures not followed and limited resources). The negotiation process and its outcomes are described. From this study we conclude that stakeholder communication and transparency are key elements in anticipating and preventing the arising of such situations. Often, these are in short supply when large land deals occur. In this case, ex-post solutions were arrived at. Finally, the paper looks at the broader dimensions of land deals that pollute the water feeding a water supply scheme. Such situations are a clear violation of the human right to safe drinking water – an issue that has not yet been sufficiently documented in the literature and which merits further attention.

Evidence from tree-based projects in Africa suggests that currently, only carbon sequestration and emission reduction are 'commoditised', however in an artificial way where payments are not matched to ES delivery, but adjusted or supplemented with co-benefits.

The project is a commercial venture and during the last five years it has unfolded in a relatively vulnerable Kenyan setting. A policy process analysis, interactive fieldwork and document review has explored its interrelationship with local livelihood assets and state institutional capabilities. The paper reveals that while REDD+ institutions are globally standardised through negotiations interlocked with political and development interests, projects are faced with state and local resource histories and perceptions, and in responding to such settings, these projects become highly contextual. Locally, the Kasigau project links carbon benefits to specific and significant local vulnerabilities such as low ‘value' dryland, water scarcity and illiteracy. This has yielded an apparently uncontested acceptance and favourable perception of the project among the Kasigau people, appearing to reverse long histories of exclusion from their resources by centralised state-based resource management regimes. Yet the negative perception of state institutions that the Kasigau people have built up over time raises questions as to whether the state can ably oversee a successful REDD+ process, as is assumed by the international community. If resource management is not factually decentralised in particular countries, greater capture of local resource rights in REDD+ could result from state regimes than from private-commercial regimes. As such, international gains in safeguarding local communities in REDD+ could be seriously compromised. Kenya recently initiated land reforms as part of resource decentralisation, but the resulting regimes remain fuzzy, subordinate to powerful centralised interests, focused on individual title, and inadequately adapted to particular local contexts. Such reforms potentially re-shuffle the local engagement of the Kasigau project which draws its apparent success partly from a communalised land tenure system. This paper concludes that communal systems, if well-defined, may provide a better basis for the governance of REDD+ projects, enabling inclusivity, collective action and societal benefits. If projects can genuinely enable local people to manage and benefit from their forest resources, REDD+ promises to be a multi-governance programme that bridges the gap between global and local institutions and interests in the sustainable use of forests.","2013","2019-06-28 14:38:15","2019-06-28T14:38:15Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Brighton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While efforts to conserve the island's biological diversity have centred primarily on the designation of protected areas, policies have increasingly focused on local communities. The experiences of the last 20 years have shown that community-based approaches to conservation offer considerable challenges due to the complex politics of natural resource use, which involve multiple and diverse stakeholders, often with very different and sometimes conflicting values. In this paper, I focus on the environmental perceptions and values of two groups in the Central Menabe region of western Madagascar – conservation organisations and rural households – revealing a contrasting set of views regarding the region's forest. I show that the conservation discourse has changed over time, increasingly emphasising the biological diversity of the region's tropical dry-deciduous forest and prioritising non-consumptive uses of natural resources. Although policy has changed in response to changing values, I show that it has been underpinned by the notion that hatsake (‘slash-and-burn' agriculture) is an irrational practice driven by necessity rather than choice. Policy has thus sought to provide livelihood alternatives, firstly through forestry, then through changes in cultivation and increasingly through tourism. This misunderstands the local view of the forest, which sees hatsake as a way to make the land productive, as long as it is carried out responsibly according to local fady (taboos). As well as facing problems of translating conservation goals into local values and misunderstanding the motives for forest clearance, policy has been based on a narrative that attaches particular land use practices to ethnic identities.

Improving smallholder agriculture remains a key development pathway to tackle these challenges. The dryland development paradigm (DDP), introduced in 2007, presented a highly influential framework for dryland development based on systems research. This paper empirically derives a new, updated DDP. It assesses recent, cutting-edge dryland science, combining literature review with qualitative and quantitative analysis of research published by the world's largest dryland science and development research initiative. The new DDP comprises eight characteristics that are distilled into three integrative principles: Unpack, Traverse and Share. The new DDP is applied and tested to identify key dryland knowledge and development gaps. A future research agenda is then elucidated, grounded in a research in development approach, in which research anchored in the three integrative principles is embedded within the context it seeks to improve. Supported by greater trans-disciplinarity and knowledge co-production, operationalization of the new DDP can deliver both novel scientific insights and development impact in line with the aspirations of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.","2017","2019-06-28 14:38:03","2019-06-28T14:38:03Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"agricultural systems; arid and semi-arid environments; livelihoods; social-ecological resilience; sustainable development goals",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the term biocultural diversity, introduced to denote this link, is being used increasingly, there has been little critical reflection on what it precisely refers to. I argue that it is used with partic ular reference to 'indigenous traditional' people, but that there is scope for extending its application within biocultural discourse. I therefore review the concept of culture and discuss what constitutes cultural values of the nat ural environment. I conclude that the concept of culture must be under stood as involving a dynamic process of trans cultural exchange and constant re-articulations of tradition resulting in the persistence of certain cultural practices.

Alien trees can simultaneously bring many benefits and cause sub- stantial environmental harm, very often leading to conflicts over how they should be managed. The impacts grow over time as invasions spread, and societal perceptions of the value of alien trees also change as understanding grows and as values shift. This leads to a dynamic environment in which trade- offs are required to maximise benefits and minimise harm. The management of alien tree populations needs to be strategic and adaptive, combining all possible management interventions to promote the sustainable delivery of optimal outcomes. We use examples, mainly from South Africa (where issues relating to invasive alien trees introduced for forestry have received most attention), to argue for holistic and collaborative approaches to alien tree management. Such approaches need to include bold steps, such as phasing out unsustainable plantation forestry that is based on highly invasive species, and in which the costs are externalised. Furthermore, it would be advisable to impose much stricter controls on the introduction of alien trees to new environments, so that problems that would arise from subsequent invasions can be avoided",2014,"2019-06-28 14:37:49","2019-06-28T14:37:49Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biological invasions; Conflicts of interest; Economic assessments; Ecosystem services; Tree invasions",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A system of prohibitions known as fady is central to Malagasy culture. We examined whether fady that relate to the use of natural resources in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar play an important conservation role. Prohibitions ranged from strict taboos in which a species or area was forbidden by the ancestors to social norms that concerned acceptable behavior when harvesting wild species. Strict taboos offered real protection to threatened species, such as the lemur Propithecus edwardsi and the carnivore Cryptoprocta ferox. Taboos also reduced pressure on some economically important endemic species by preventing their sale or limiting the harvest season. Despite their value for conservation, the taboos did not appear to originate from attempts to sustainably manage resources. Nevertheless, social norms, in which the sanction was social disapproval rather than supernatural retribution, encouraged sustainable harvesting practices for tenrecs (Tenrec ecudatus) and pandans (Pandanus spp.). Unfortunately, the social norms concerning methods of harvesting pandans appeared to be breaking down in villages surrounding Ranomafana National Park, and we suggest that the imposition of external conservation rules is weakening traditional management. Informal institutions are important to conservation because they suggest ways of improving cultural understanding and conservation communication. Food taboos influence societal preferences, which affect the wider demand for a species. Most important, where capacity to enforce external conservation rules is limited, informal institutions may provide the only effective regulations. Informal institutions should receive greater attention from conservation biologists so that local people's conservation roles can be acknowledged fairly and so that potential synergies with conservation objectives can be realized.",2008,"2019-06-28 14:37:48","2019-06-28T14:37:48Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18616743",NA,NA,NA,"Co-management; Community-based conservation; Culture; Customs; Fady; Ranomafana National Park; Taboos",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The paper focuses on a selection of these: knowledge generation, bridging organizations, social learning, and the emergence of adaptive co-management. Co-management can be considered a knowledge partnership. Different levels of organization, from local to international, have comparative advantages in the generation and mobilization of knowledge acquired at different scales. Bridging organizations provide a forum for the interaction of these different kinds of knowledge, and the coordination of other tasks that enable co-operation: accessing resources, bringing together different actors, building trust, resolving conflict, and networking. Social learning is one of these tasks, essential both for the co-operation of partners and an outcome of the co-operation of partners. It occurs most efficiently through joint problem solving and reflection within learning networks. Through successive rounds of learning and problem solving, learning networks can incorporate new knowledge to deal with problems at increasingly larger scales, with the result that maturing co-management arrangements become adaptive co-management in time. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Most farmers in this area were not familiar with the application of weather forecasts/climate predictions for agricultural production, or with other science-based agrometeorological products. They relied almost fully on their experience and traditional knowledge for farming decision making. The indicators for traditional knowledge are demonstrated here in broad terms, relying on the stories and indications from observations and years of experience of their use by the farmers. These means of engagement with the natural environment, are skills not well understood by most scientists, but useful to the farmers. They range from the constellation of stars, animal behavior, cloud cover and type, blossoming of certain indigenous trees, appearance and disappearance of reptiles, to migration of bird species and many others. It is suggested that some short-term traditional forecasts/predictions may be successfully merged with science-based climate predictions.

Nonetheless, many successful examples exist, although an equal number have seemingly not met expectations. Is this because of poor implementation or rather a generally flawed model?

The successes and issues that emerge at different stages of the grazing project reflect local socioeconomic priorities and show how people manage their time and labor according to household livelihood goals. However, the project favored the interests of cattle owners who were already the more socially and politically powerful members of the community.

The mix of local institutions created in preceding participatory development projects resulted in fragmented forms of authority. Elsewhere, local communities have developed their own institutions for managing local affairs. How in such a context do elected local governments wield power, recognise other authorities and contribute to restoration of national state legitimacy? The Lokoly forest in Benin was never subject to state intervention. The Toui-Kilibo forest, however, has been a protected state forest since 1940 and a site for participatory forest management projects since early 1990s. In both cases, the public domain has been enclosed and local government legitimacy over forest resource management contested, hampering the formation of a so-called democratic local government. This article compares these two cases, elaborating on social actors' strategies in the symbolic construction and channelling of power, and on the challenges local governments face when attempting to wield legitimate authority over public spaces and articulate local politics to national state building.",2008,"2019-06-28 14:37:12","2019-06-28T14:37:12Z",NA,"49–61",NA,"1",6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"agement; biodiversity; decentralisation; democracy; institutional development; local government; local politics; natural resource man-; power; west africa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Different sectors of society typically value, need and demand different bundles of ecosystem services. At the same time, important trade-offs exist between the production of different services, and it is not possible to increase the resilience of all ecosystem services simultaneously. Decisions about which services to sustain in a particular social–ecological system therefore require trade-offs that are inherently political. Politics can be described as ‘the authoritative allocation of values for a society' (Easton 1965). To further complicate matters, the desired mix of services will evolve with changing societal values and preferences, and the resilience of ecosystem services is only one among many desired outcomes (e.g. equality, human rights, democracy) of social–ecological systems. Resolving these trade-offs requires resolution of collective-action dilemmas and intergroup conflicts, a process that comes replete with power inequalities, asymmetric resource bases and unequal outcomes. This chapter discusses some of the asymmetries and power dynamics that underlie decisions of which ecosystem services should form the focus for resiliencebuilding initiatives; the remainder of the book assumes these choices have been made and focuses on how the resilience of some agreed-on mix of ecosystem services may be enhanced. Here, we focus specifically on the social consequences of trade-offs between ecosystem services; asymmetries in the distribution of ecosystem services; and we briefly discuss the broad literature of how these may be addressed through wider deliberative processes. We find that issues associated with the allocation of ecosystem services are poorly integrated into the resilience literature, and suggest that an improved understanding of allocation trade-offs could result from more applied research on use of ecosystem services that integrates perspectives from the social sciences about how and why people make and respond to decisions concerning ecosystem services. Prompted by escalating rates of environmental change, resilience thinking is one emerging applied field that explicitly seeks to inform managers and policy-makers in the governance of social-ecological systems (SES) and the ecosystem services they produce (Berkes et al. 2000; Walker and Salt 2006).",2015,"2019-06-28 14:37:06","2019-06-28T14:37:06Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1017/CBO9781316014240.003",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thus, any adverse impacts on ecosystems can alsohave an adverse impact on those cultures, societies and communities.Governments should therefore consider the promotion of sustainable use principles and guidelines as additional instruments for the protection and maintenance of traditional cultures and societies. Because of their interdependence, the fourteen principles should be consideredtogether. However, the principles will not apply equally to all situations. They areof general relevance and should be adapted to different contexts. Their application will vary according to the biodiversity being used, the conditionsunder which they are being used, and the institutional and cultural context inwhich the use is taking place. The practical principles in most instances apply to both consumptive and non-consumptive uses of biodiversity components. They take into accountrequirements related to policies, laws and regulations; management of biologicaldiversity; socio-economic conditions; and information, research and education. The principles and guidelines are a valuable tool to promote conservation andcontribute to poverty alleviation. However, the application of the principles andguidelines will be most effective when appropriate measures are taken for theprotection of biological resources and remediation of the harmful effects of pollution, civil and armed conflicts, displacement of people and other externallyderived impacts are being undertaken. The sustainable use of biodiversity willalso be enhanced if provisions are made for mitigation, remediation, compensation and /or rehabilitation when biodiversity loss results from overuse.Finally, it is important to underline that, in many cultures and societies, womenare often the primary users and managers of components of biodiversity. It follows that special consideration should be given to involve and empowerwomen in the implementation of these principles and guidelines and, in general,in the management of biodiversity components.",2004,"2019-06-28 14:37:00","2019-06-28T14:37:00Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, this gap is empirically addressed on a sample of 48 sub-Saharan countries over the 1990-2009 period taking the ""Ecoregion protection"" score provided by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) as a measure of biodiversity conservation policies. It is sought whether economic incentives such as biodiversity targeted international transfers as well as tourism revenues have an impact on biodiversity conservation policies. Moreover, spillover effects are also hypothesized owing to the public good character of biodiversity conservation policies. International financial assistance as well as tourism are found to have an effect on biodiversity conservation policymaking. Our results also evidence complementary spatial spillover effects between biodiversity conservation policies.",2016,"2019-06-28 14:36:52","2019-06-28T14:36:52Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Ecoregion score; Local spillover; Spatial econometrics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we discuss and integrate the perspectives of various disciplines academics and stakeholders who participated in a workshop on scales of European biodiversity governance organised in Brussels in the autumn of 2010. The 23 participants represented various governmental agencies and NGOs from the European, national, and sub-national levels. The data from the focus group discussions of the workshop were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The core scale-related challenges of biodiversity policy identified by the participants were cross-level and cross-sector limitations as well as ecological, social and social-ecological complexities that potentially lead to a variety of scale-related mismatches.

Fundamentally, we must know where individual species live, which ones are vulnerable, where human actions threaten them, and their levels of protection. As conservation knowledge and threats change, we must reevaluate priorities. We mapped priority areas for vertebrates using newly updated data on \textgreater21,000 species of mammals, amphibians, and birds. For each taxon, we identified centers of richness for all species, small-ranged species, and threatened species listed with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Importantly, all analyses were at a spatial grain of 10 x 10 km, 100 times finer than previous assessments. This fine scale is a significant methodological improvement, because it brings mapping to scales comparable with regional decisions on where to place protected areas. We also mapped recent species discoveries, because they suggest where as-yet-unknown species might be living. To assess the protection of the priority areas, we calculated the percentage of priority areas within protected areas using the latest data from the World Database of Protected Areas, providing a snapshot of how well the planet's protected area system encompasses vertebrate biodiversity. Although the priority areas do have more protection than the global average, the level of protection still is insufficient given the importance of these areas for preventing vertebrate extinctions. We also found substantial differences between our identified vertebrate priorities and the leading map of global conservation priorities, the biodiversity hotspots. Our findings suggest a need to reassess the global allocation of conservation resources to reflect today's improved knowledge of biodiversity and conservation.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:36:42","2019-06-28T14:36:42Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23803854",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is widely thought that private sector expectations of higher agricultural commodity prices and government concerns about longer-term food and energy security underpin much recent land acquisition for agricultural investments. These processes are expected to have lasting and far-reaching implications for world agriculture and for livelihoods and food security in recipient countries. This paper critically examines evidence of trends, scale, geography and drivers in the global land rush.While this analysis broadly corroborates some widespread assumptions, it also points to a more complex set of drivers that reflect fundamental shifts in economic and geopolitical relations linking sovereign states, global finance, and agribusiness through to local groups. Only a solid understanding of these fundamental drivers can help identify levers and pressure points for policy responses to address the challenges raised by large-scale land acquisitions.",2012,"2019-06-28 14:36:37","2019-06-28T14:36:37Z",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; China; agriculture; biofuels; food; international political economy; investment; land grab",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In urban areas, ecosystem service assessment studies need to account for the complex land use patterns, which change over relatively short periods of time. We discuss an analytical framework for the spatial and temporal integration of different ecosystem services in an urban region to determine synergies, trade-offs and losses, and we employ a case study in Leipzig-Halle, Germany. The following five ecosystem services, which are of special importance for urban areas, were selected: local climate regulation, recreation potential, biodiversity potential, food supply, and above-ground carbon storage. These services were analyzed from 1990 to 2006. Our results identified only slight increases in urbanization (1% or 3 km²) and in mining restoration (-11 km²). However, the detected land use changes led to synergies with biodiversity and climate regulation of \textgreater 50% of the total area, whereas trade-offs of approximately 60% were detected between variables such as climate regulation and recreation. Finally, we address both the opportunities and the challenges that were encountered in the integration study, specifically with respect to the application in land use planning.

By offering detailed case studies and a systematic analysis of results, the book examines the effects of institutional interaction on environmental governance and explores the ways in which international and European Union policies can either reinforce or undercut one another.After a conceptual overview in which Oberthur and Gehring identify three causal mechanisms by which institutional interaction can affect environmental governance, ten case studies apply this theoretical approach. Six cases use an international institution as their starting point and four begin with a European Union legal instrument. The international regimes examined include the widely known Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and World Trade Organization and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The EU instruments analyzed include lesser-known directives on the protection of habitats, the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment, and air quality. The studies show that although conflict and interference among different regimes and institutions do take place, synergistic interactions are common. The findings on the importance of, and mechanisms behind, these outcomes offer valuable insights for both scholars and policymakers.Contributors: Beatrice Chaytor, Clare Coffey, Andrew Farmer, Thomas Gehring, John Lanchbery, Sebastian Oberthur, Alice Palmer, G.

Given the increases in extreme weather events projected to affect the Southern Africa region, it is essential to assess how household and community-level adaptations have been helped or hindered by institutional structures and national policy instruments. In particular, there is a need to reflect on efforts related to the United Nations' environmental conventions to ensure that policies support the maintenance of local adaptations and help retain the resilience of socio-economic and environmental systems. This paper examines three interlinked drivers of adaptation: climate change, desertification and drought, assessing the extent to which international and national policy supports local adaptive strategies in three countries in southern Africa. We show that while common ground exists between desertification and climate change adaptations at the policy level, they are insufficiently mainstreamed within broader development approaches. Similarly, there are some overlaps between policy-driven and autonomous local adaptations, but the mutually supportive links between them are poorly developed. Further efforts to integrate local adaptation strategies within policy could increase local resilience to environmental change, while also contributing to wider development goals. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

IWRM has a long history, and rich experiences, both positive and negative, have been reported.

However, the concept remains loose and many different conservation approaches are published under the 'PES label'. We reviewed 457 articles obtained in a structured literature search in order to present an overview of the PES literature. This paper (1) illustrates the different analytical perspectives on PES concepts and types, (2) shows the geographic focus of PES research and (3) identifies the major foci of the overall PES research. The paper finally (4) identifies differences and similarities in conservation programs and main research topics between developing and industrialized countries to (5) disclose potentials for research synergies, should research experiences in the two types of countries be exchanged more deliberately. We demonstrate that only few publications describe Coasean PES approaches. The majority of research refers to national governmental payment programs. The overall design of national PES programs in Latin America resembles the design of those in the US and EU considerably. Programs in the US and EU have been in place longer than most of the frequently published Latin American schemes. However the former are hardly considered in the international PES literature as research is usually published under different terminologies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:36:14","2019-06-28T14:36:14Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agri-environmental programs; Conservation measures; Economic instruments; Environmental incentives; PES; Payments for environmental services",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper examines the role of the VES concept in measuring trends in human wellbeing. Under conventional arguments from applied welfare economics, standard measures of market consumption may be extended to include the value of direct environmental services, which affect welfare in ways that are not mediated by the consumption of purchased goods. The VES concept does not capture values such as ecological sustainability and distributional fairness that are not reducible to individual welfare. And its operationalization is constrained by the well-known limitations of nonmarket valuation methods. Nonetheless, attempts to calculate the value of environmental services can provide insights into the tradeoffs between market activity and environmental quality that are implicit in the process of economic growth. Such efforts can promote informed debate concerning the achievement of sustainable development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It has the potential to influence global forest governance in a socially acceptable way. The mechanism as it stands needs much improvement to avoid the pitfalls of earlier forest governance mechanisms. The research, at this stage, is not sufficient to improve it. Most of the literature is fairly slanted towards technical issues and the prospective design of the scheme or normative opposition to it. Despite this copious amounts of scholarly and advocacy work, there is too little attention focused on the social and governance dimensions of the proposals. Author's Note Forests are crucial in the struggle for sustainable development. Not only do they have a role in the preservation of global ecological systems, but moreover they are especially important for supporting the livelihoods of local populations. When forests were first addressed in the context of climate change, they were assessed in mostly financial and technical terms. We think there is a need to insert a social perspective into the debate, taking into account the lessons learned from many years of intervening in developing countries "" forests. Engineers who have designed REDD as a brilliant, but top-down, scheme for tropical forests conservation seem to have forgotten such lessons. Without addressing deforestation, climate objectives cannot be reached. But further, drawing from years of work on forests, we see that without considering the impacts on local societies and the lessons learned from development aid REDD cannot succeed.

However, despite this acknowledgement there continues to be a gap in reaching the right people with the correct strategies for disaster risk reduction. This paper identifies the need for a specific framework identifying how indigenous and western knowledge may be combined to mitigate against the intrinsic effects of environmental processes and therefore reduce the vulnerability of rural indigenous communities in small island developing states (SIDS) to environmental hazards. This involves a review of the impacts of environmental processes and their intrinsic effects upon rural indigenous communities in SIDS and how indigenous knowledge has contributed to their coping capacity. The paper concludes that the vulnerability of indigenous communities in SIDS to environmental hazards can only be addressed through the utilisation of both indigenous and Western knowledge in a culturally compatible and sustainable manner. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet many projects are based on weak scientific foundations, and effectiveness is rarely evaluated with the rigor necessary for scaling up and understanding the importance of these approaches as policy instruments and conservation tools (2, 5, 6).

Location: Global. Methods: We applied generalized linear modelling to a global database of local ant assemblages to predict the species density of ants globally. Predictors evaluated included simple climate variables, combined temperature × precipitation variables, biogeographic region, elevation, and interactions between select variables. Areas of the planet identified as beyond the reliable prediction ability of the model were those having climatic conditions more extreme than what was represented in the ant database. Results: Temperature was the most important single predictor of ant species density, and a mix of climatic variables, biogeographic region and interactions between climate and region yielded the best overall model. Broadly, geographic patterns of ant diversity match those of other taxa, with high species density in the wet tropics and in some, but not all, parts of the dry tropics. Uncertainty in model predictions appears to derive from the low amount of standardized sampling of ants in Asia, in Africa and in the most extreme (e.g. hottest) climates. Model residuals increase as a function of temperature. This suggests that our understanding of the drivers of ant diversity at high temperatures is incomplete, especially in hot and arid climates. In other words, our ignorance of how ant diversity relates to environment is greatest in those regions where most species occur – hot climates, both wet and dry. Main conclusions: Our results have two important implications. First, temperature is necessary, but not sufficient, to explain fully the patterns of ant diversity. Second, our ability to predict ant diversity is weakest exactly where we need to know the most, the warmest regions of a warming world. This includes significant parts of the tropics and some of the most biologically diverse areas in the world.",2011,"2019-06-28 14:35:57","2019-06-28T14:35:57Z",NA,"652–662",NA,"4","17",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18957298",NA,NA,NA,"Aridity; Biodiversity; Biogeography; Formicidae; Species richness; Temperature",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The cycle is repeated at the end of the last step. It is important to stress that environmental problems are not merely technical; they raise inherent political and social questions as well.

We present a national-level analysis that empirically estimates socioeconomic impacts of CBNRM across Tanzania, while systematically controlling for potential sources of bias. Specifically, we apply a difference-in-differences model to national-scale, cross-sectional data to estimate the impact of three different CBNRM governance regimes on wealth, food security and child health, considering differential impacts of CBNRM on wealthy and poor populations. We also explore whether or not longer-standing CBNRM efforts provide more benefits than recently-established CBNRM areas. Our results show significant improvements in household food security in CBNRM areas compared with non-CBNRM areas, but household wealth and health outcomes in children are generally not significantly different. No one CBNRM governance regime demonstrates consistently different welfare outcomes than the others. Wealthy households benefit more from CBNRM than poor households and CBNRM benefits appear to increase with longer periods of implementation. Perhaps evidence of CBNRM benefits is limited because CBNRM hasn't been around long enough to yield demonstrable outcomes. Nonetheless, achieving demonstrable benefits to rural populations will be crucial for CBNRM's future success in Tanzania.",2015,"2019-06-28 14:35:54","2019-06-28T14:35:54Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 26186210",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traditional strategies of rangeland and water management were described and the most important forage species identified. Pastoralists' perceptions were compared across age, gender and site. There was a positive correlation between pastoralists' preference ranking of forage species and crude protein content of the species. IEK of men and women was complementary. The process of rangeland degradation was described as shortage of grass and decrease in density and frequency of highly palatable grass species, leading to low milk production and reduced conception rates in cows. The results confirmed that the IEK of these pastoralists could still provide the basis for sustainable resource utilization and rangeland rehabilitation. However, the young generation in the area had not only limited knowledge but also showed less interest to learn and apply the traditional resource management strategies. Therefore, there is high need to perpetuate, document and use this IEK for sustainable development. On the other hand, shortage of forage resources as a result of rangeland shrinkage (leading to rangeland degradation and woody plants encroachment), less application of IEK, the gap between traditional and formal systems, and trends of disobeying traditional rules and regulations were identified as current challenges for the Borana pastoralists.",2006,"2019-06-28 14:35:38","2019-06-28T14:35:38Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Borana pastoralists; Current challenges; Indigenous ecological knowledge; Traditional management",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Consequently, the paper comõplements and reframes 'DPSIR' using a complex system methodology based on the distinction between four 'spheres' of sustainability (environmental, economic, social and political) and the analysis of their functioning and relationships. The pair-wise interface aspects are characterised through investigation of the 'demands' and 'supply' of each sphere relative to the others.

First, CBC can be seen in the context of paradigm shifts in ecology applied ecology.

The lessons from these fields inc the importance of cross-scale conservation, adaptive comanagement, the question of incentives and mult stakeholders, the use of traditional ecological knowledge, and development of a cross-cultural conservati ethic.

In 2004, the South African Department of Science and Technology, through the National Research Foundation, established a Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology, with the primary goal of providing scientific understanding and building capacity in the field of biological invasions. South Africa is an extraordinary natural laboratory for the study of biological invasions, and the Centre for Invasion Biology (C·I·B) has capitalised on this situation. During its first decade, the C·I·B generated over 800 publications, and produced almost 200 graduates at honours, master's and doctoral levels. The C·I·B has therefore made a considerable contribution to building human capacity in the field of biological invasions. Substantial advances have been made in all aspects of invasion science, which is not limited to biology and ecology, but includes history, sociology, economics and management. The knowledge generated by the C·I·B has been used to inform policy and improve management practices at national and local levels. The C·I·B has emerged as a leading institute in the global field of invasion biology, with several unique features that differentiate it from similar research institutes elsewhere. These features include a broad research focus that embraces environmental, social and economic facets, leading to a diverse research programme that has produced many integrated products; an extensive network of researchers with diverse interests, spread over a wide geographical range; and the production of policy- and management-relevant research products arising from the engaged nature of research conducted by the C·I·B.",2014,"2019-06-28 14:35:27","2019-06-28T14:35:27Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1590/sajs.2014/a0074",NA,NA,NA,"Biological invasions; Capacity building; Centres of Excellence; Invasive alien species; Research strategy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Beyond that, water as a renewable natural resource does not fall into conventional analytical paradigms. It is an input to many economic activities but also an integral part of the natural environment with important social and cultural dimensions. It has proven difficult to provide an analytical definition of the resource, for legal and management purposes. Recent economic literature, notably the writings of Professor Elinor Ostrom, offer a helpful framework. Her suggestion that water resources should be seen as a 'common-pool resource', best managed under 'common-property regimes' in 'polycentric governance systems' is helpful, if apparently abstract. The reform of South African water law and management arrangements since 1994 illustrates many of the underlying issues and provides a practical example of Ostrom's approach. The challenges of implementation highlight the importance of understanding the analytical concepts in their full context as failure to do so can undermine their usefulness and effectiveness as practical management tools.

Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options.

"VPWDZYZ6","journalArticle",2014,"Wright, Claire","Developments And Challenges To The UN Declaration On The Rights Of Indigenous Peoples Five Years On: Insights On Biodiversity And Case Studies In Bangladesh, Brazil, Japan And Uganda: An Introduction To The Special Issue","Indigenous Policy Journal","","","","","After many years of drafts and negotiations, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (hereafter 'UNDRIP') was adopted on the 13th of September 2007. Building on the scope offered by other international instruments such as the ILO Convention Nº 169, the Declaration enshrines both the individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples: including the right to self-determination, the right to education, the right to development, land and natural resource rights, intellectual property rights, cultural rights, and the right to treaty recognition (Allen & Xanthaki, 2009). The adoption of the Declaration undoubtedly constitutes an important victory for indigenous peoples around the world and a result of years of efforts to gain recognition and respect for their rights as peoples. UNDRIP has been met with both high expectations over its potential impact and considerable concern over some States' initial reticence to ratify it and implement in practice. In order to be meaningful, the resulting debate should be fueled by theoretical considerations, real-life experiences, practical guidelines, and – most importantly – the participation of indigenous peoples themselves. In this special issue, we hope to contribute to this important debate. In the following pages we present five articles researched and written by scholars working on the implementation of UNDRIP at international level as well as the situation of indigenous peoples in different rather under-researched corners of the world: Bangladesh, Brazil, Japan, and Uganda. Working from different perspectives and scholarly disciplines, the articles presented here highlight both the opportunities presented by the Declaration in terms of the protection of indigenous peoples' cultural and territorial rights and the difficulties faced in implementing specific clauses at the national level. The evidence in this issue suggests that the "" boomerang "" pattern of using international allies and legal instruments to exert pressure over unwilling national governments leads to mainly symbolic rather than substantive victories (Keck and Sikkink 1998). Nonetheless, there is also plenty of evidence to suggest that the UNDRIP itself has opened up new avenues for the protection of specific rights and therefore what is needed are guidelines for its successful implementation. Offering a legal perspective on the potential of the UNDRIP, Federica Cittadino (University of Trento-EURAC) shows that the Declaration constitutes an important step forward for two reasons: on the one hand, because it is one of the most comprehensive legal frameworks on indigenous peoples' collective and individual rights; and on the other because it can be used as a powerful instrument to clarify the Wright, Tomaselli, Ordóñez Ganoza. Introduction to the Special Issue. scope of the clauses of the Convention on Biological Diversity that affect indigenous peoples. Offering a more holistic approach to the question of indigenous rights, Federica shows how they are intrinsically linked to the protection of biodiversity and benefit-sharing, an additional and beneficial consequence of the UNDRIP. Despite the generally optimistic perspective, the article highlights that the lengthy process to adopt the Declaration reflects how the question of the respect for human rights and indigenous peoples is a difficult one for many States as well as the importance of offering guidelines to ensure that the UNDRIP is implemented in practice. The other articles in the edition are country-based case studies, offering both encouraging and discouraging evidence on the potential impact of the UNDRIP in relation to both cultural and territorial rights. Referring to the case of the Ainu People in Japan, Yoko Tanabe (University of London) highlights the important role of the UNDRIP in their recognition as an indigenous people by the Japanese government. Throughout the text Yoko describes the government's historical policies towards the Ainu and the sudden change in the context of the momentum gained by the Japanese indigenous movement coupled with the impact of the UNDRIP. Indeed, in 2008 the National Diet of Japan recognized the Ainu as an indigenous people for the first time, constituting an enormous victory in the context of the government's ratification of the Declaration. Nevertheless, Yoko explains that as a result of generations of inequality and assimilation policies, the Ainu people still face many difficulties due to the political context in which indigenous issues are framed. On the other hand, Eva Gerharz (Ruhr-Universität Bochum) refers to the expectations created by the Declaration throughout the world and the frustration of these expectations in the case of Bangladesh, where indigenous peoples expected the new discourse to improve their bargaining position over the national government which had in the past limited their political demands. In this sense, Eva refers to the Constitutional Amendment of 2011 as a lost "" window of opportunity "" when the Bangladeshi government rejected a demand for the constitutional recognition of indigenous people. Consequently, the article traces the emergence of indigenous activism in Bangladesh, outlining the largely "" constraining "" socio-political changes in recent years and analysing the political process that led to the rejection of the demand for recognition in the Constitution. Essentially, Eva's research contests the "" boomerang "" paradigm prevalent in social science studies on transnational activism and domestic legal systems. In the same way, Sayuri Fujushima (Brazil) outlines frustrated expectations in Brazil. Referring to the "" Belo Monte "" project to build a hydroelectric dam along the Xingu and Iriri rivers, an area well-known for its biological diversity and for being home to various indigenous territories, Sayuri highlights the importance of the free, prior, informed consent established in UNDRIP being applied and the difficulties in doing so. The article describes how the Belo Monte project has given rise to several debates, including its impact on indigenous peoples in the region, as a result of the potential environmental impact on their territories. Despite the 2011 ruling by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to suspend the dam construction, the Brazilian government is going ahead with its plans, contravening UNDRIP's requirement to consult indigenous people, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Fujushima's article reminds us that international standards such as the UNDRIP are only Wright, Tomaselli, Ordóñez Ganoza.

Challenges facing a network of representative marine protected areas in the Mediterranean: prioritizing the protection of underrepresented habitats. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 22– 28. The high endemism of the Mediterranean Sea provides strong motivation to develop a comprehensive plan for the conservation of its biodiversity and the management of its marine resources. Increasingly, this ecosystem-level approach calls for a comprehensive network of marine protected areas (MPAs) representative of the richness and diversity of this shared basin. Today, Mediterranean MPAs do not represent the diverse geography and habitats in the region. Despite a recent declaration on trawling restrictions in deep waters (.1000 m), there are no true deep-sea Mediterranean MPAs. All but one (98.9%) of the 94 marine areas currently under some type of protection or management are coastal. Moreover, 69 (73.4%) are located along the basin's northern shore, high-lighting the lack of MPAs in the south and east coasts. Yet, these underrepresented regions and habitats are ecologically distinctive by virtue of their particular oceanographic and biogeographic conditions. We identify several obstacles to Mediterranean MPA implementation and discuss how they can be overcome through strategic MPA network planning, contending that regional disparities in governance, institutional structures, wealth distribution, social capital, and availability of ecological data are responsible for discrepancies in the establishment and effectiveness of MPAs in this region.",NA,"2019-06-28 14:35:05","2019-06-28T14:35:05Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"MPA networks; Mediterranean Sea; biogeography; governance; oceanography; representation; site selection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most farmers in this area were not familiar with the application of weather forecasts/climate predictions for agricultural production, or with other science-based agrometeorological products. They relied almost fully on their experience and traditional knowledge for farming decision making. The indicators for traditional knowledge are demonstrated here in broad terms, relying on the stories and indications from observations and years of experience of their use by the farmers. These means of engagement with the natural environment, are skills not well understood by most scientists, but useful to the farmers. They range from the constellation of stars, animal behavior, cloud cover and type, blossoming of certain indigenous trees, appearance and disappearance of reptiles, to migration of bird species and many others. It is suggested that some short-term traditional forecasts/predictions may be successfully merged with science-based climate predictions. The traditional knowledge and its use, reported on in this paper, is what scientists learned from farmers. Berkes was right that scholars have wasted too much time and effort on a science versus traditional knowledge debate; we should reframe it instead as a science and traditional knowledge dialogue and partnership.

A substantial literature has developed on the reasons for failure in CBNRM. In this paper, we complement this literature by considering these factors in relation to two successful CBNRM case studies. These cases have distinct differences, one focusing on the conservation of hirola in Kenya on community-held trust land and the other focusing on remnant vegetation conservation from grazing pressure on privately held farm land in Australia. What these cases have in common is that both CBNRM projects were initiated by local communities with strong attachments to their local environments. The projects both represent genuine community initiatives, closely aligned to the original aims of CBNRM. The intrinsically high level of ""ownership"" held by local residents has proven effective in surviving many challenges which have affected other CBNRM projects: from impacts on local livelihoods to complex governance arrangements involving non-government organizations and research organizations. The cases provide some signs of hope among broader signs of crisis in CBNRM practice.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:34:55","2019-06-28T14:34:55Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23811773",NA,NA,NA,"Capacity building; Community participation; Community-based conservation; Livelihoods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper considers four key AC-related concepts and their relevance to public sector organisations with mandates to manage and conserve freshwater ecosystems for the common good. The concepts are the importance of in-house prior related knowledge, the importance of informal knowledge transfer, the need for motivation and intensity of effort, and the importance of gatekeepers. These concepts are used to synthesise guidance for a way forward in respect of such freshwater management and conservation, using the imminent release of a specific scientific conservation planning and management tool in South Africa as a case study. The tool comprises a comprehensive series of maps that depict national freshwater ecosystem priority areas for South Africa. Insights for implementing agencies relate to maintaining an internal science, rather than research capacity; making unpublished and especially tacit knowledge available through informal knowledge transfer; not underestimating the importance of intensity of effort required to create AC, driven by focussed motivation; and the potential use of a gatekeeper at national level (external to the implementing organisations), possibly playing a more general 'bridging' role, and multiple internal (organisational) gatekeepers playing the more limited role of 'knowledge translators'. The role of AC as a unifying framework is also proposed.",2011,"2019-06-28 14:34:53","2019-06-28T14:34:53Z",NA,"917–925",NA,"5","47",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21431779",NA,NA,NA,"Freshwater biodiversity; Gatekeepers; Knowledge transfer; Prior related knowledge; Social ecological systems; Systematic conservation planning",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, mainstreaming has faced a number of interrelated institutional, financial, legal, knowledge and policy barriers. As such, despite 15 years of existence of the UNCCD, successes in reversing and/or preventing land degradation are widely perceived to be limited. This paper highlights the nature of these barriers to mainstreaming and identifies ways in which specific limitations that hamper mainstreaming of land degradation into national, regional and international activities and policies may be overcome. It also identifies institutional infrastructures through which scientific findings may more effectively enter policy, suggesting that scientific bodies are required to strategise, coordinate and stimulate the global scientific research community to support mainstreaming and the up-scaling of efforts to combat land degradation. Such a scientific body could also stimulate national cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder knowledge exchange. The paper then moves to the national level to examine mainstreaming processes in Namibia, a country particularly advanced in taking a more integrated approach. Although the Namibia case study shows an impressive degree of integration, there are still many lessons to be learned in order to further strengthen mainstreaming processes. These lessons form the basis of our conclusion and recommendations, which outline a potential way forward.",2011,"2019-06-28 14:34:46","2019-06-28T14:34:46Z",NA,"299–312",NA,"2","22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Desertification; Institutions; Land degradation; Mainstreaming; Policy; Science-policy interface; UNCCD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It suffered several devastating droughts and famines between the late 1960s and early 1990s. Speculation about the climatology of these droughts is unresolved, as is speculation about the effects of land clearance on rainfall and about land degradation in this zone. However, recent findings suggest a consistent trend of increasing vegetation greenness in much of the region. Increasing rainfall over the last few years is certainly one reason, but does not fully explain the change. Other factors, such as land use change and migration, may also contribute.

Local norms and customs shape people's everyday forms of resource use. In contrast, the commercial uses of natural resources often remain highly centralized, conditioned by government policies of the colonial and post-colonial eras. During the past several decades, there has been a shift from this predominantly centralized natural resource management towards more devolved models known very broadly as Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM). CBNRM models work to strengthen locally accountable institutions for natural resource use and management, enabling local groups of people to make better decisions about the use of land and resources. Because it involves the transfer of authority over natural resources to local communities, including of potentially valuable resources such as wildlife and timber, CBNRM is often about major institutional reforms and fundamental changes in power. This pan-African review of the impacts, challenges, and future directions of CBNRM highlights the diverse range of forms of community involvement in natural resource management that have emerged across the continent during the past twenty years. CBNRM means different things to different actors in different places across sub-Saharan Africa. In much of western and central Africa, CBNRM is interpreted by government authorities, donor agencies, and NGOs as benefit-sharing or outreach between national parks and adjacent communities. In such instances communities are not empowered as authorized local resource managers but are involved principally as passive recipients of benefits controlled elsewhere. This form of outreach and benefit-sharing is also a characteristic of some protected area management in East African countries. In Southern Africa, CBNRM is most clearly defined in terms of the devolution of rights to make management decisions, and capture benefits, in relation to resources located on communal lands. In all instances CBNRM involves some degree of co-management of resources between central authorities, local government, and local communities which share rights and responsibilities through diverse institutional arrangements. The various forms of CBNRM and their many locally-specific adaptations have greatly diversified approaches to natural resource governance in sub-Saharan Africa. Some notable ecological, economic, and institutional achievements have been documented.",2009,"2019-06-28 14:34:36","2019-06-28T14:34:36Z",NA,"",207,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There has been a global shift in natural resource governance, particularly increased co-management of protected areas (PAs). Yet there has been little research on how this change may be affecting access to ES. We aim to fill this research gap by considering: (a) what ES are considered most important, (b) what factors are important in determining whether a person can access ES, and (c) how rules and regulations regarding ES access are decided and enforced. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using questionnaires, focus groups and interviews with stakeholders in a case study PA in Madagascar, co-managed by local community associations (VOIs) and an NGO. Data analysis was framed around the IPBES framework and access factors. Respondents considered provisioning services most important, but also valued cultural and regulating services. Institutions and social identity had the largest impact on access to ES. VOI members and indi-viduals who knew VOI committee members had greater access to ES than non-members. Findings show that co-management may be shifting ES access inequalities rather than reducing them, and we outline a number of challenges relating to PA co-management.

The answer to this question depends on how human societies develop in terms of demographics and economic development, technological change, energy supply and demand, and land use change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios describes new scenarios of the future, and predicts greenhouse gas emissions associated with such developments. These scenarios are based on a thorough review of the literature, the development of narrative ""storylines"", and the quantification of these storylines with the help of six different integrated models from different countries. The scenarios provide the basis for future assessnlents of climate change and possible response strategies. The report illustrates that future emissions, even in the absence of explicit climate policies, depend very much on the choices people make; how economies are structured, which energy sources are preferred, and how people use available land resources. The IPCC published previous greenhouse gas emissions scenarios in 1990 and 1992. The current scenarios introduce many innovative aspects, such as narrative descriptions of the scenarios, inclusion of information on the availability of energy technologies, and an analysis of international equity issues. This IPCC Special Report is the most comprehensive and state-of-the-art assessment available of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and provides invaluable information for industry, policy-makers, environmental organizations, and researchers in global change, technology, engineering and economics.",NA,"2019-06-28 14:34:10","2019-06-28T14:34:10Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The paper used both primary and secondary data sources. Data were analysed qualitatively. Results indicate that the ban led to a reduction of tourism benefits to local communities such as: income, employment opportunities, social services such as funeral insurance, scholarships and income required to make provision of housing for the needy and elderly. After the hunting ban, communities were forced to shifts from hunting to photographic tourism. Reduced tourism benefits have led to the development of negative attitudes by rural residents towards wildlife conservation and the increase in incidents of poaching in Northern Botswana. The implications of hunting ban suggest that policy shifts that affect wildlife conservation and rural livelihoods need to be informed by socio-economic and ecological research. This participatory and scientific approach to decision-making has the potential to contribute sustainability of livelihoods and wildlife conservation in Botswana.",2018,"2019-06-28 14:34:00","2019-06-28T14:34:00Z",NA,"41–61",NA,"1","100",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of these people are expected to live in developing countries and have higher incomes than currently is the case, which will result in increased demand for food. In the best of circumstances, the challenge of meeting this demand in a sustainable manner will be enormous. When one takes into account the effects of climate change (higher temperatures, shifting seasons, more frequent and extreme weather events, flooding, and drought) on food production, that challenge grows even more daunting. The 2010 floods in Pakistan and excessive heat and drought in Russia that resulted in wildfires and a grain embargo are harbingers of a troubled future for global food security. This research monograph follows the 2009 release of IFPRIs widely read food policy report, Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation, which used a detailed global agriculture model to analyze crop growth under two simulated future climate scenarios. This monograph takes advantage of and expands on IFPRIs cutting-edge climate modeling expertise to address the climate change threat in the context of larger food security challenges. It provides the most comprehensive analysis to date on the scope of climate change as it relates to food security, including who will be most affected and what policymakers can do to facilitate adaptation.

We adopt a scenario planning approach to cope with this problem of prediction. We use an ecological assessment framework developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment to determine key social and ecological driving forces in the Northern Highlands Lake District. From these, we describe three alternative scenarios to the year 2025 in which the projected use of ecological services is substantially different. The work reported in this paper demonstrates how scenarios can be developed for a region and provides a starting point for a participatory discussion of alternative futures for northern Wisconsin.

This article seeks to extend the applicability of governance theory by developing hypotheses about how different governance types can be expected to handle processes of change characterized by nonlinear dynam-ics, threshold effects, cascades, and limited predictability.

"NC3A8CH5","journalArticle",NA,"","FOREWORD AfDB & WWF","","","","","","The past decade and a half has seen many countries sustain growth rates of five per cent and above. As the continent opens up to futuristic prospects, the narrative is rightly beginning to question the extent to which Africa's growth is sustainably transforming livelihoods while lifting millions from abject poverty. While celebrating Africa's huge and diverse natural resource base, this report equally recognizes the continent's rich ecosystems – and the role both play in economic development. It notes that the current development trajectories and choices made by African countries both individually and collectively will have direct impacts on people and nature. These impacts will touch not only on inclusivity but also on the sustainability of the natural resources and ecosystem services that anchor economic growth. The report shares well examined perspectives of the pressures and drivers of Africa's economic fortunes over the next 50 years. It provides detailed analysis of population trends, urbanization, changing consumption patterns, investment levels as well as the role of the global economy in both African agriculture and extractives. Trends in these areas, as well as in those in the infrastructure domain, will have implications on the quality and ecological sustainability of Africa's growth. It is our conviction that appreciation of the development trajectories and their relationship with primary resources; the water -agriculture-energy-extractives nexus and their impacts on natural resource endowments, is critically important for planning for inclusivity and sustainability. It is pertinent to consider what Africa's economic development means for its ecological systems. Development planners must take these implications into account to ensure sustainable outcomes. This report has systematically treated this very fluid and dynamic subject by considering and analyzing critical drivers of various economic objectives in key development sectors that will steer Africa's progress in the next 50 years and beyond.",NA,"2019-06-28 14:33:31","2019-06-28T14:33:31Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the context of environmental governance, concerns center on perceived links between elite capture and decentralization, particularly in developing countries where decentralized natural resource governance has been widely implemented. But, there is limited empirical knowledge regarding if, and the conditions under which, decentralization might promote elite capture, or whether institutional design factors can militate against it. We examine how local institutional arrangements under forest sector decentralization affect the risk of elite capture of forest benefits, as well as the potential for a key institutional design factor (linkages to external organizations as an accountability-building mechanism) to mitigate this risk. We analyze forest product harvesting data as well as social, ecological, and institutional data from pre- and post-decentralization across 56 forests and 174 community groups in four countries. We employ hierarchical linear modeling to test the extent to which decentralization is associated with inequities in the distribution of forest harvest benefits within communities, and to characterize the institutional arrangements that affect elite capture outcomes. We find not only strong evidence for increased local rule-making under decentralization, but also significantly higher risk of elite capture of forest harvest benefits. This risk increases with increasing time since decentralization, but it is also substantially moderated in cases where an external organization was involved in organizing the local forest institution. Our findings highlight ways in which decentralization reforms are filtered by institutional arrangements to produce different outcomes, and generate new knowledge on micro-institutional factors that can reduce the risk of elite capture in decentralized environmental governance regimes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 14:33:29","2019-06-28T14:33:29Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Decentralization; Forests; Governance; Inequality; Institutions",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The model used for these experiments is a variable-resolution global atmospheric model, the conformal-cubic atmospheric model (CCAM). It is shown that CCAM may be used to obtain plausible projections of future climate change, as well as skilful forecasts at the seasonal and short-range time scales, over the Southern African region. The model is additionally applied for extended simulations of present-day climate at spatial scales ranging from global simulations at relatively low horizontal resolu- tion, to the micro-scale at ultra-high (1 km) resolution. Applying the atmospheric model at the shorter time scales pro- vides the opportunity to test its physical parameterisation schemes and its response to fundamental forcing mechanisms (e.g. ENSO). The existing skill levels at the shorter time scales enhance the confidence in the model projections of future climate change, whilst the related verification studies indicate opportunities for future model improvement.",2011,"2019-06-28 14:33:04","2019-06-28T14:33:04Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Multi-scale climate modelling; Variable-resolution atmospheric model",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the mechanisms for achieving integration in research have been the subject of few empirical studies. A major challenge of doing integrated research is how to combine and effectively manage diverse disciplinary perspectives and other knowledge/s in the generation of new knowledge for practice and policy change. We examined this challenge within a large catchment management research project in Australia's Murray Darling Basin and asked, 'What supports or enables integration in research?' Addressing this question requires an attention to integration as a dynamic process of knowledge production. We propose a model of this dynamic process which is characterised by a changing demand for integration in five different phases: (1) establishing the imperative for integration; (2) coordinating different disciplinary and other knowledge commitments; (3) consolidating arrangements for integration; (4) prioritising outputs from integration; and, (5) representing outputs of integration. For researchers and research managers this model can help identify the mechanisms required to support effective integration within research projects. We identify these mechanisms as sites and devices for integration that must be both planned (as part of the original integrated research design) and emergent (iteratively created and supported) in research projects.",2015,"2019-06-28 14:33:02","2019-06-28T14:33:02Z",NA,"18–31",NA,"1","47",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Catchment management; Integration; Interdisciplinary; Knowledge production; Mechanisms; Research practice; Transdisciplinary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The map is accompanied by measurements of deforestation between 1990, 2000 and 2010 for West Africa, Central Africa and Madagascar derived from a systematic sample of Landsat images-imagery from equivalent platforms is used to fill gaps in the Landsat record. Net deforestation is estimated at 0.28% yr(-1) for the period 1990-2000 and 0.14% yr(-1) for the period 2000-2010. West Africa and Madagascar exhibit a much higher deforestation rate than the Congo Basin, for example, three times higher for West Africa and nine times higher for Madagascar. Analysis of variance over the Congo Basin is then used to show that expanding agriculture and increasing fuelwood demands are key drivers of deforestation in the region, whereas well-controlled timber exploitation programmes have little or no direct influence on forest-cover reduction at present. Rural and urban population concentrations and fluxes are also identified as strong underlying causes of deforestation in this study.",2013,"2019-06-28 14:32:57","2019-06-28T14:32:57Z",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23878331",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Progress towards CCD requires multi-stakeholder, multi-sector working and the development of partnerships between actors who may not otherwise have worked together. This creates challenges and opportunities that require careful examination at project and institutional levels and necessitates the sharing of experiences between different settings. In this paper, we draw on the outcomes from a multi-stakeholder workshop held in Mozambique in 2012, the final in a series of activities in a regional project assessing emerging CCD partnerships across southern Africa. The workshop involved policymakers, researchers and representatives from NGOs and the private sector. We employ a content analysis of workshop notes and presentations to identify the progress and challenges in moving four case study countries (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe) towards CCD pathways, by exploring experiences from both project and policy levels. To advance institutional support for the development of successful CCD policies, practices and partnerships, we conclude that there is a need for: (a) institutional development at the national level to strengthen coordination and more clearly define roles and responsibilities across sectors, based on the identification of capacity and knowledge gaps; (b) partnership development, drawing on key strengths and competences of different stakeholders and emphasising the roles of the private sector and traditional authorities; (c) learning and knowledge-sharing through national and regional fora; and (d) development of mechanisms that permit more equitable and transparent distribution of costs and benefits. These factors can facilitate development of multi-stakeholder, multi-level partnerships that are grounded in community engagement from the outset, helping to translate CCD policy statements into on-the-ground action. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2014,"2019-06-28 14:32:41","2019-06-28T14:32:41Z",NA,"713–725",NA,"2","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 95047379",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Climate change; Community-based development; Mitigation; Multi-sector approaches; Policy; Southern Africa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Crops vary in the degree to which they benefit from pollinators, and many of the most pollinator-dependent crops are also among the richest in micronutrients essential to human health. This study examines regional differences in the pollinator dependence of crop micronutrient content and reveals overlaps between this dependency and the severity of micronutrient deficiency in people around the world. As much as 50% of the production of plant-derived sources of vitamin A requires pollination throughout much of Southeast Asia, whereas other essential micronutrients such as iron and folate have lower dependencies, scattered throughout Africa, Asia and Central America.

In Kenya, the youth bulge presents a number of challenges for both the youth and the country. Youth represent the most abundant asset Kenya has or will have over the near future. Nonetheless, there have been a considerable number of surveys conducted and reports and studies published that invariably conclude that there are persistent risks and challenges faced by Kenyan youth. The youth are, and will remain, a significant share of Kenya's population for the foreseeable future. Developing and implementing appropriate strategies, policies and programmes to mitigate the risks and challenges they (the youth) face must be much more of a priority for the government than it currently is. Any failure to provide appropriate opportunities for this large segment of the population could have enormous economic, political, cultural, and social consequences. Engaging the youth population fully is therefore no longer a choice but an imperative in the development process.

We suggest, on the basis of a multi-disciplinary analysis, that a pan-EU TGC system is not the way forward for Europe. It is vital that the Commission (and the majority of Member States) avoids implementation of such policy designs put forward by a coalition of vested interests. They should instead look at, and act upon, the available evidence from those countries that have experimented with TGCs (e.g. Flanders, UK and Sweden) and design policies that stand a better chance of meeting the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and equity. In particular, the policies must enable EU to meet the immense innovation/industrialisation challenge by inducing the development of a capital goods industry that can, eventually, diffuse a broad range of technologies that use renewable energy sources. Only then we can acquire an ability to implement an industrial revolution in the energy system in a way that broadly meets the criteria of effectiveness and dynamic efficiency. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The world was still mired in the Great Depression and another war was imminent. Governments wanted an annual measure of their economies' output so that they could manage their wartime planning needs. If crisis was a trigger to adopt GDP in the 1940s, there is a crisis now that is calling out for a different measure. Our climate is changing, our fisheries are depleted, our soils are degraded, our water supplies are overextended. We now need a measure that goes beyond just the annual output of a country. We need a measure that looks at wealth in its entirety— combining produced, social, human, and, importantly, natural capital. Both developed and developing countries are looking beyond GDP to help them address today's challenges. A number of countries are already undertaking natural capital accounting by compiling accounts for water, energy, and minerals to be able to manage them better or to evaluate the trade-offs needed for making different development decisions. Australia suffers from frequent and more intense droughts. In the 1980s, it decided to take a hard look at how scarce water resources were being used. After debates and experiments over a methodology to compile accounts in the late 1990s, the government began accounting for how much water is used by different sectors—agriculture, industry, and households—and the price these sectors were paying for consuming it. When drought struck again, this information helped to ensure that the most critical and efficient users got water. Now, Australia has expanded its suite of natural capital accounts to include energy, minerals, land, and environmental protection expenditure.",2012,"2019-06-28 14:32:03","2019-06-28T14:32:03Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research project is to be completed in 1999 and it is hoped that the assessments and recommendations made will help in harmonising the implementation of European Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92. Twenty-one supply chains in seven countries are analysed (The primary factor in success is the capacity of a set of firms in a supply chain based in a particular area to effectively coordinate such matters as the identification of joint objectives, definition and control of quality, variety management, image promotion, and research & development. Market characteristics are secondary factors in success. Following Bouquin (1986) we draw a distinction between effectiveness and efficiency. Emphasising the crucial step of goal setting (effectiveness) may highlight the relevance of internal resources and competencies of a set of firms, according to Teece (1981). This explains why the set of firms manages not only to react to their environment but also to influence it. This approach is consistent with a number of rationality and organisation models proposed by Simon (1976). This kind of transition from individual to collective forms of management shows a possible link between an approach in terms of hybrid forms (efficiency) and an approach in terms of core competence (effectiveness).We end with an evaluation of Reg.

The matrix architecture facilitates addressing key questions related to current climate research and policy-making: identifying the effectiveness of different adaptation and mitigation strategies (in terms of their costs, risks and other consequences) and the possible trade-offs and synergies. The two main axes of the matrix are: 1) the level of radiative forcing of the climate system (as characterised by the representative concentration pathways) and 2) a set of alternative plausible trajectories of future global development (described as shared socio-economic pathways). The matrix can be used to guide scenario development at different scales. It can also be used as a heuristic tool for classifying new and existing scenarios for assessment. Key elements of the architecture, in particular the shared socio-economic pathways and shared policy assumptions (devices for incorporating explicit mitigation and adaptation policies), are elaborated in other papers in this special issue. 1",2014,"2019-06-28 14:31:53","2019-06-28T14:31:53Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

CAMPFIRE aims to help communities to manage resources, especially wildlife, for their own local developments. The program;s central pbjectives is to alleviate rural poverty by giving rural communities autonomy over resource management and to demonstrate to them that wildlife is not necessarily a hindrance to arable agriculture, ""but a resource that could be managed and 'cultivated' to provide income and food"". In this paper, we assess two importance elements of CAMPFIRE: poverty alleviation and local empowerment and comment on the program's performance in achieving these highly interconnected objectives. We analyze the program's achievements in poverty alleviation by exploring tenurial patterns, resource ownership adn the allocation of proceeds from resource exploitation; and its progress in local empowerment by examining its adminstrative and decision making structures. We conclude that the program cannot effectively achieve the goal of poverty alleviation wuihout first addressing the administrative and legal strictires that the country;s political ecology. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of "" bridging organizations "" seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts.

Given the close link between the preservation of indigenous peoples' ways of life, traditions, and knowledge, on the one hand, and the protection of biological diversity, on the other, this paper argues that the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous can be used as a powerful instrument to suggest an evolutionary interpretation of some of the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In particular, indigenous peoples' rights to land, natural resources, traditional knowledge, as well as their right to a healthy and protected environment are analysed in order to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of CBD article 8(j). A careful reading of the above-mentioned rights makes it possible to reinforce the interpretation that while implementing the provisions on access to genetic resources and State-to-community benefit sharing, CBD parties shall take into account the rights of indigenous peoples as affirmed by the UNDRIP. Furthermore, the UNDRIP offers specific indications on the procedural measures needed to implement those rights (free prior informed consent and participation rights). In this respect, it is argued that these procedural mechanisms offer a partial response to the challenges posed by the concrete implementation of the UNDRIP.",2014,"2019-06-28 14:31:43","2019-06-28T14:31:43Z",NA,"","","4","XXIV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we explore the global governance challenge posed by planetary boundaries interactions by focusing on the role of polycentric systems and order, a theoretical field that has gained much interest in the aftermath of claims of a stagnant UN-process. In the first part we work toward a clarification of polycentric order in an international context, and develop three propositions. We then present a case study of the emergence of international polycentricity to address interacting planetary boundaries, namely the climate change, ocean acidification and loss of marine biodiversity complex. This is done through a study of the Global Partnership on Climate, Fisheries and Aquaculture (PaCFA) initiative. As the case study indicates, a range of mechanisms of polycentric order (ranging from information sharing to coordinated action and conflict resolution) operates at the international level through the interplay between individuals, international organizations and their collaboration patterns. While polycentric coordination of this type certainly holds potential, it is also vulnerable to internal tensions, unreliable external flows of funding, and negative institutional interactions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2012,"2019-06-28 14:31:40","2019-06-28T14:31:40Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive governance; Biodiversity; Climate change; Global environmental change; Ocean acidification; Planetary boundaries; Polycentric systems",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"QWW9BEFK","journalArticle",NA,"","A Great Green Wall for Africa?","",NA,"","","","A t first the women weren't sure they could do it. Or should do it. Many in the village agreed. Digging holes, planting trees, being leaders—weren't these men's jobs? "" Everyone said we were crazy, "" recalls Nakho Fall, a stocky, vivacious woman in a red-and-white print dress. With a dozen women neighbors and their children, Fall is seated beneath a shade tree in Koutal, a village in western Senegal where goats and chickens amble across the sandy lanes that separate one household from the next. At 11 in the morning, it is already blazing hot, though in a month's time the rains and humidity of summer will make today's weather seem sublime. The men of Koutal could not plant the trees, Fall explains, because they were already occupied. Some worked in the near-by salt factory, transported there by beat-up vans that did not return them home until dark. Others had migrated to Dakar, the distant capital, in search of whatever jobs they could find. But something needed to be done. Trees were disappearing in Koutal, and with them much else. "" We didn't even hear birds singing anymore, "" says Fall. None of the women beneath the shade tree are familiar with the term "" climate change, "" but all affirm that Koutal's weather has grown more forbidding in recent years. Persistent drought has turned the soil dry and hard. It has also grown salty. Although Koutal is located fifty miles from the Atlantic Ocean, two "" arms "" of the sea extend inland all the way to the village. The Senegalese government lacks precise data on how much the sea has risen, says Adama Kone, an agricultural extension agent, but soil tests indicate that seawater has pen-etrated the underground freshwater table, increasing the soil's salinity and making it harder to grow crops. "" Taste it, "" says one woman, pressing her index finger into the chalky white earth. "" You will see we are telling the truth. "" Defying local stereotypes, the women of Koutal decided to fight for their village. With seedlings and technical expertise supplied by the Senegalese government and foreign donors, the women spent six years transforming 290 hectares of land from bare, crusted soil into a thriving agro-forestry reserve. There, they harvest timber to sell in the local markets while also growing millet and other crops to eat. Incomes and food production have risen substantially, and the women look to the future with a new sense of confidence. "" We are very proud that our children will benefit from this land, "" says Adam Ndiaye, a hearty grandmother. "" And they will know this work was done by women. "" L ittle did the women of Koutal know it, but by planting trees to save their village they were also building part of what advocates are calling the Great Green Wall of Africa. At the moment, this wall is more vision than reality. If it gets built, a Great Green Wall could be a game-changer for Africa—a solid advance in the fight against not only the emerging threat of climate change but the endur-ing scourges of poverty and hunger. Much depends, however, on which version of this wall gets built. Will it be, as some African heads of state have urged, a literal wall of trees stretch-ing across the continent like a long and narrow plantation? Or will it be a more metaphorical wall that brings to scale such local successes as the achievements in Koutal? These questions should be front and center when diplo-mats arrive in Durban, South Africa, this month for the next round of international climate negotiations. Two years ago, the Copenhagen climate negotiations ended in failure and recrimina-tions, as the United States and other big polluter nations refused to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. But the success of grass-roots initiatives like Koutal's, and the prospect of establishing a Great Green Wall across Africa, suggest that there are practical solutions to the climate crisis, if one knows where to look. And not a moment too soon. The horrific famine unfolding in the Horn of Africa is the latest reminder of what scientists have been saying for years: Africa is the continent that will suffer first and worst from the extra heat and drought that cli-mate change will unleash over the coming decades.

We hypothesized that soil water limitations and browsing by livestock would be the primary mechanisms accounting for the failure of natural regeneration. We used three sets of experiments-1) seedling performance in response to shade and watering in a nursery, 2) field regeneration with and without browsing, and 3) regeneration beneath trees with and without browsing-to examine regeneration success. Seedlings were established in plots from seeds sown directly into the soil for nursery and field experiments, but natural germination occurred beneath trees. Survival and relative growth rates (RGR) were used to monitor seedling performance. Seedlings that received neither shade nor watering treatments had lower seedling survival (53±15) as compared with other treatment combinations. Highest seedling survival was recorded under shade and 1 d waterings·wk-1treatment combinations (92±1). However, shade treatments had a minimal increase on seedling RGR. Water limitation is not a crucial limiting factor for D. glabra recruitment, as 53 of the seedlings survived without both shade and supplemental water for 1 yr. Field experiments, however, demonstrated that browsing greatly reduced seedling survival (below 15) and suppressed growth of surviving seedlings, suggesting that browsing is the major factor preventing natural recruitment. Natural recruitment of D. glabra is unlikely with the existing continuous and intensive grazing/browsing in Afar rangelands, where the mobility of pastoralists is restricted. We suggest that planting nursery-raised seedlings in home gardens of settled pastoralists and establishment of grazing reserves in some key range sites that contain D. glabra could help offset the recruitment failure of native food species D. glabra in Afar rangelands. © Society for Range Management.",2009,"2019-06-28 14:31:32","2019-06-28T14:31:32Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Afar pastoralists; Herbivory; Seedling survival; Tree regeneration",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The continent receives about 4% of all international travelers and tourism receipts, but tourism is “significant” (\textgreater2% GDP and \textgreater5% exports) in about half of SSA countries. Countries in Africa are now focusing on tourism as a source of growth and diversification, but with only limited policy guidance from most donors, despite the sector's potential. At present, the World Bank Group (WBG) provides limited support for tourism and has no overall sector strategy, though the CDF, PRSP and CAS are helping to define such strategies in a few countries. This paper gives a broad overview of issues in tourism in Africa and suggests guidelines to assist countries to develop a more coherent framework for tourism. Given its cross-sectoral nature, tourism can only grow sustainably if it is integrated into the country's overall economic, social and physical planning policies. Where national attractions are shared with neighboring countries, joint or regional promotion and marketing can be effective. Partial measures are unlikely to address vested interests, underlying economic relationships and generic social or physical constraints effectively. Government's role is to create the policy framework that will encourage for-profit private investment, and that, in combination with regulatory frameworks, will ensure good economic returns and linkages with other sectors. To be sustainable, tourism requires an open dialogue between the government, the private sector, civil society and local communities to ensure consensual decisions and the generation of economic benefits for a broad spectrum of the population.

In addition, the article investigates possible ways of integrating selected LTK indicators with the meteorological drought forecasting parameters to improve applicability of meteorological drought forecasts at local level.LTK forecast data from trees and plants for 2012/2013 season was collected through structured questionnaires administered on 40 household heads. Monthly rainfall data spanning the period September 1999-May 2013 (14 years) were used for the calculation of Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) for the study catchment. The trends in drought severity scale were then compared to the results from local traditional knowledge drought forecasting (LTKDF) to find out the degree to which they could be correlated. The GEONETCast ten day composite, SPOT VEGETATION, normalized difference vegetation index (S10 NDVI) dataset with a 1. km resolution was used to evaluate vegetation condition and hence track drought occurrence and severity. The trends in drought severity scale from NDVI were then compared to the results from LTKDF to establish the level of correlation. The analyses carried out shows a good correlation between traditional plant and tree indicators with resulting conditions captured as NDVI and SPI. The challenge on the LKDF systems, however, was lack of historical data to ensure adequate analysis and comparison with meteorological data. The study therefore recommends continuous monitoring and standardisation of LTK data.",2015,"2019-06-28 14:31:05","2019-06-28T14:31:05Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Drought forecasting; Limpopo River Basin; Local traditional knowledge; Natural disaster; Normalised Difference Vegetation Index",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Spatial planning results in actions that may affect the distribution and quality of a wide range of ecosystem services. Hence, spatial planning decisions would benefit from systematic considerations of their effects on ecosystem services. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) provides an excellent platform to this purpose. This paper aims at providing insights on why it is important to promote ecosystem service-inclusive SEA processes, and on how to do it, with particular emphasis on spatial planning. First, possible actions to include relevant information of ecosystem services throughout the SEA process are presented. Second, the advantages are discussed by considering both the characteristics of ecosystem services approaches and the criteria of good-quality SEA. Finally, four main challenges are identified, concerning scoping, scale issues, trade-offs, and indicators, respectively. Addressing these challenges is bound to produce more effective SEA Processes and better planning decision.",2011,"2019-06-28 14:30:59","2019-06-28T14:30:59Z",NA,"143–149","","March 2015","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"ecosystem services; land use; planning; scale; strategic environmental assessment; trade-offs",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Safeguards to protect local people's rights and interests have been formulated in response concerns over the potential negative impact on communities of forest preservation. To fulfil safeguards, many sub-Saharan African countries are looking to community-based natural resource management (CBNRM). Current critiques of CBNRM projects outline the importance of project design and policy context in shaping whether or not communities actually stand to benefit. This paper explores these aspects in a case study of Joint Forest Management (JFM) in Zambia, and examines the role of Zambia's REDD preparedness programme in shaping them. The case study was evaluated using stakeholder and policy document analyses, informed by interviews, and tied into the broader forest governance network. The findings highlight the way in which the politics and policies of forest governance in Zambia shape the on-the-ground JFM project and influence community benefits. In the case studied, even with careful local-level project design, JFM would be hindered in its delivery of REDD safeguards. Therefore, for REDD to deliver community safeguards, it must be considered as a broader process of political and governance change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2019-06-28 14:30:58","2019-06-28T14:30:58Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Climate change; Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM; Katanino; Mitigation; Safeguards",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Responses to this urgency include calls to integrate the needs of ecosystem services and biodiversity into the design of conservation interventions. The benefits of such integration are purported to include improvements in the justification and resources available for these interventions. Nevertheless, additional costs and potential trade-offs remain poorly understood in the design of interventions that seek to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services. We sought to investigate the synergies and trade-offs in safeguarding ecosystem services and biodiversity in South Africa's Little Karoo. We used data on three ecosystem services–carbon storage, water recharge, and fodder provision–and data on biodiversity to examine several conservation planning scenarios. First, we investigated the amount of each ecosystem service captured incidentally by a conservation plan to meet targets for biodiversity only while minimizing opportunity costs. We then examined the costs of adding targets for ecosystem services into this conservation plan. Finally, we explored trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem service targets at a fixed cost. At least 30% of each ecosystem service was captured incidentally when all of biodiversity targets were met. By including data on ecosystem services, we increased the amount of services captured by at least 20% for all three services without additional costs. When biodiversity targets were reduced by 8%, an extra 40% of fodder provision and water recharge were obtained and 58% of carbon could be captured for the same cost. The opportunity cost (in terms of forgone production) of safeguarding 100% of the biodiversity targets was about US$500 million. Our results showed that with a small decrease in biodiversity target achievement, substantial gains for the conservation of ecosystem services can be achieved within our biodiversity priority areas for no extra cost.",2010,"2019-06-28 14:30:10","2019-06-28T14:30:10Z",NA,"1021–1030","","4","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 20136871",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity assessments; Carbon storage; Conservation planning; Fodder provision opportunity cost; Payments for ecosystem services; Water recharge",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A global water assessment model called “WaterGAP 2” is described, which consists of two main components—a Global Water Use model and a Global Hydrology model. These components are used to compute water use and availability on the river basin level. The Global Water Use model consists of (a) domestic and industry sectors which take into account the effect of structural and technological changes on water use, and (b) an agriculture sector which accounts especially for the effect of climate on irrigation water requirements. The Global Hydrology model calculates surface runoff and groundwater recharge based on the computation of daily water balances of the soil and canopy. A water balance is also performed for surface waters, and river flow is routed via a global flow routing scheme. The Global Hydrology model provides a testable method for taking into account the effects of climate and land cover on runoff. The components of the model have been calibrated and tested against data on water use and runoff from river basins throughout the world. Although its performance can and needs to be improved, the WaterGAP 2 model already provides a consistent method to fill in many of the existing gaps in water resources data in many parts of the world. It also provides a coherent approach for generating scenarios of changes in water resources.

Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO2 than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels.

In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is $125. trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and $145. trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 $US. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at $4.3-20.2. trillion/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 14:29:53","2019-06-28T14:29:53Z",NA,"152–158","","1","26",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24992461",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem services; Global value; Monetary units; Natural capital",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three challenges are highlighted: (1) ensuring the appropriate scope for action; (2) moving beyond intervention-based decision guidance; and (3) developing long-term shared capacity for strategic planning. To overcome these challenges we have applied explorative scenarios and normative back-casting with stakeholders from different sectors at the regional level in East Africa. We then applied lessons about appropriate scope, enabling adaptation pathways, and developing strategic planning capacity to scenarios processes in multiple global regions. Scenarios were created to have a broad enough scope to be relevant to diverse actors, and then adapted by different actor groups to ensure their salience in specific decision contexts. The initial strategy for using the scenarios by bringing a range of actors together to explore new collaborative proposals had limitations as well as strengths versus the application of scenarios for specific actor groups and existing decision pathways. Scenarios development and use transitioned from an intervention-based process to an embedded process characterized by continuous engagement.

Among the drivers of change that we discuss are those of policy-driven growth in biofuel production, which has had a role to play in the rapid increase in food prices, along with other factors. We demonstrate the off-setting impact that supply growth could have on the socio-economic impacts of biofuels, both in terms of price changes, as well as changes in nutrition status. We also look at some evidence that points towards the significant impact that climate change could have on the agriculture and agricultural prices in the future. Combining our quantitative experiments with cited evidence from other studies, we suggest a range of policy interventions that could be instrumental in offsetting the negative impacts of food prices, and helping to promote those benefits in situations where they might exist. Among these suggestions, we encourage increased investments in the agricultural sector, so as to reverse the steadily declining growth of research and development spending and change decades of counter-productive agricultural trade and national-level sector policies.",2009,"2019-06-28 14:29:41","2019-06-28T14:29:41Z",NA,"1–27","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In environmental decision making, scenario development tends to include participatory methods for engaging stakeholders and is conducted at multiple scales. This paper presents insights from participatory scenario development in two separate multiscale environmental assessments. We find that, to engage stakeholders at multiple scales, it is important that the issues explored at each scale be relevant and credible to stakeholders at that scale. An important trade-off exists between maintaining relevance to stakeholders at different scales and maintaining consistency across scales to allow for comparison of scenarios. Where downscaling methods are used to ensure consistency, there can be important consequences for (1) the diversity of scenario outcomes, (2) temporal mismatches in the storylines at different scales, and (3) power relationships among stakeholders at different scales. We suggest that development of participatory scenarios at multiple scales has a strong potential to contribute to environmental decision making, but it requires a substantial investment of time and resources to realize its full potential.",2007,"2019-06-28 14:29:40","2019-06-28T14:29:40Z",NA,"","","1",12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Mediterranean; Multiscale scenario; Participation; Scale; Scenario; Southern Africa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This approach builds on the premise that characteristic bundles of ecosystem service use represent integrated expressions of different underlying social-ecological systems. We test the approach in South Africa using national census data on the direct use of six provisioning services (freshwater from a natural source, firewood for cooking, firewood for heating, natural building materials, animal production, and crop production) at two different scales. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify three distinct ecosystem service bundles that represent social-ecological systems characterized by low, medium and high levels of direct ecosystem service use among households. We argue that these correspond to 'green-loop', 'transition' and 'red-loop' systems as defined by Cumming et al. (2014). When mapped, these systems form coherent spatial units that differ from systems identified by additive combinations of separate social and biophysical datasets, the most common method of mapping social-ecological systems to date. The distribution of the systems we identified is mainly determined by social factors, such as household income, gender of the household head, and land tenure, and only partly determined by the supply of natural resources.

However, quantifying the ecological effects of such policies at the regional level is difficult. A case study was conducted at the regional level in the ecologically vulnerable region of the Loess Plateau, China, through the use of several methods including the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), hydrological modeling and multivariate analysis. An assessment of the changes over the period of 2000-2008 in four key ecosystem services was undertaken to determine the effects of the Chinese government's ecological rehabilitation initiatives implemented in 1999. These ecosystem services included water regulation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and grain production. Significant conversions of farmland to woodland and grassland were found to have resulted in enhanced soil conservation and carbon sequestration, but decreased regional water yield under a warming and drying climate trend. The total grain production increased in spite of a significant decline in farmland acreage. These trends have been attributed to the strong socioeconomic incentives embedded in the ecological rehabilitation policy. Although some positive policy results have been achieved over the last decade, large uncertainty remains regarding long-term policy effects on the sustainability of ecological rehabilitation performance and ecosystem service enhancement. To reduce such uncertainty, this study calls for an adaptive management approach to regional ecological rehabilitation policy to be adopted, with a focus on the dynamic interactions between people and their environments in a changing world.",2012,"2019-06-28 14:29:37","2019-06-28T14:29:37Z",NA,"1–10","","2",7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22359628",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The radiative forcing levels (and the associated climate signal) are described by the new Representative Concentration Pathways. The second axis, socio-economic developments comprises elements that affect the capacity for mitigation and adaptation, as well as the exposure to climate impacts. The proposed scenarios derived from this framework are limited in number, allow for comparison across various mitigation and adaptation levels, address a range of vulnerability characteristics, provide information across climate forcing and vulnerability states and span a full century time scale.

It compares a Reference scenario which leads to an increase in global mean temperature of 4??C by the end of the 21st century with a Mitigation scenario which stabilises greenhouse gas concentrations at around 450ppm CO2e and leads to a 2??C increase in 2100. Associated changes in river runoff are simulated using a global hydrological model, for four spatial patterns of change in temperature and rainfall. There is a considerable difference in hydrological change between these four patterns, but the percentages of change avoided at the global scale are relatively robust. By the 2050s, the Mitigation scenario typically avoids between 16 and 30% of the change in runoff under the Reference scenario, and by 2100 it avoids between 43 and 65%. Two different measures of exposure to water resources stress are calculated, based on resources per capita and the ratio of withdrawals to resources. Using the first measure, the Mitigation scenario avoids 8-17% of the impact in 2050 and 20-31% in 2100; with the second measure, the avoided impacts are 5-21% and 15-47% respectively. However, at the same time, the Mitigation scenario also reduces the positive impacts of climate change on water scarcity in other areas. The absolute numbers and locations of people affected by climate change and climate policy vary considerably between the four climate model patterns. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2019-06-28 14:29:31","2019-06-28T14:29:31Z",NA,"592–603","","2",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"ADAM; Climate impacts; Climate policy; Mitigation; Water resources",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper explores the methods, costs, and benefits of developing and linking scenarios of social-ecological systems across multiple spatial scales. Drawing largely on experiences in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, we suggest that the desired degree of cross-scale linkage depends on the primary aim of the scenario exercise. Loosely linked multiscale scenarios appear more appropriate when the primary aim is to engage in exploratory dialog with stakeholders. Tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios seem to work best when the main objective is to further our understanding of cross-scale interactions or to assess trade-offs between scales. The main disadvantages of tightly coupled cross-scale scenarios are that their development requires substantial time and financial resources, and that they often suffer loss of credibility at one or more scales. The reasons for developing multiscale scenarios and the expectations associated with doing so therefore need to be carefully evaluated when choosing the desired degree of cross-scale linkage in a particular scenario exercise.",2007,"2019-06-28 14:29:26","2019-06-28T14:29:26Z",NA,"","","1",12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cross-scale scenarios; Environmental assessment; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment; Multiscale scenarios; Scenario analysis; Stakeholder engagement",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With ongoing climate change, temperatures and temperature variability will rise, leading to higher uncertainty in yields for major nutritional crops. Hereweinvestigate which countries are most vulnerable to teleconnected supply-shocks, i.e. where diets strongly rely on the import of wheat, maize, or rice, and where a large share of the population is living in poverty.Wefind that the Middle East is most sensitive to teleconnected supply shocks in wheat, Central America to supply shocks in maize, and Western Africa to supply shocks in rice. Weighing with poverty levels, Sub- Saharan Africa is most affected. Altogether, a simultaneous10%reduction in exports of wheat, rice, and maize would reduce caloric intake of 55 million people living in poverty by about 5%. Export bans in major producing regions would put up to 200 million people below the poverty line at risk,90%of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa.Ourresults suggest that a region-specific combination of national increases in agricultural productivity and diversification of trade partners and diets can effectively decrease future food security risks.

Three decades later, Ostrom and colleagues argued that the management of the commons was more of a drama than a tragedy. They identified that the management of common pool resources is dependent on the institutions at play at the specific scale and across scales and the various stakeholders involved in the access and use of these resources. In this paper we go one step further by arguing that the plurality of values within and across individuals coupled with the spatial scales at which different institutions are organized and at which ecosystem services are produced create mismatches in the management of the New Commons. We define the New Commons as the mosaic of land, water, and climate, and their underlying processes that regulate ecosystem structure and functions to maintain a sustainable supply of common pool resources for human well-being.

However, few studies are embedded in a social process designed to ensure effective management of ecosystem services. Most research has focused only on biophysical and valuation assessments of putative services. As a mission-oriented discipline, ecosystem service research should be user-inspired and user-useful, which will require that researchers respond to stakeholder needs from the outset and collaborate with them in strategy development and implementation. Here we provide a pragmatic operational model for achieving the safeguarding of ecosystem services. The model comprises three phases: assessment, planning, and management. Outcomes of social, biophysical, and valuation assessments are used to identify opportunities and constraints for implementation. The latter then are transformed into user-friendly products to identify, with stakeholders, strategic objectives for implementation (the planning phase). The management phase undertakes and coordinates actions that achieve the protection of ecosystem services and ensure the flow of these services to beneficiaries. This outcome is achieved via mainstreaming, or incorporating the safeguarding of ecosystem services into the policies and practices of sectors that deal with land- and water-use planning. Management needs to be adaptive and should be institutionalized in a suite of learning organizations that are representative of the sectors that are concerned with decision-making and planning. By following the phases of our operational model, projects for safeguarding ecosystem services are likely to empower stakeholders to implement effective on-the-ground management that will achieve resilience of the corresponding social-ecological systems.",2008,"2019-06-28 14:29:19","2019-06-28T14:29:19Z",NA,"9483–9488","","28",105,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 18621695",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The recent dynamic in SSA varies from dry to wet biomes. Deforestation occurred at faster rates in nations with predominantly dry forests. The wetter Congo basin countries had lower rates of deforestation, in part because tax receipts from oil and mineral industries in this region spurred rural to urban migration, declines in agriculture and increased imports of cereals from abroad. In this respect, the Congo basin countries may be experiencing an oil and mineral fuelled forest transition.

The status of river ecosystems associated with main rivers in South Africa was assessed based on the extent to which each ecosystem had been altered from its natural condition. This requires consistent data on river integrity for the entire country, which was only available for main rivers; tributaries were thus excluded from the analyses. The state of main river ecosystems in South Africa is dire: 84% of the ecosystems are threatened, with a disturbing 54% critically endangered, 18% endangered, and 12% vulnerable. Protection levels were measured as the proportion of conservation target achieved within protected areas, where the conservation target was set as 20% of the total length of each river ecosystem. Sixteen of the 112 main river ecosystems are moderately to well represented within protected areas; the majority of the ecosystems have very low levels of representation, or are not represented at all within protected areas. Only 50% of rivers within protected areas are intact, but this is a higher proportion compared to rivers outside (28%), providing some of the first quantitative data on the positive role protected areas can play in conserving river ecosystems. This is also the first assessment of river ecosystems in South Africa to apply a similar approach to parallel assessments of terrestrial, marine, and estuarine ecosystems, and it revealed that main river ecosystems are in a critical state, far worse than terrestrial ecosystems. Ecosystem status is likely to differ with the inclusion of tributaries, since options may well exist for conserving critically endangered ecosystems in intact tributaries, which are generally less regulated than main rivers. This study highlights the importance of healthy tributaries for achieving river conservation targets, and the need for managing main rivers as conduits across the landscape to support ecological processes that depend on connectivity. We also highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the way protected areas are designated, as well as the need for integrated river basin management plans to include explicit conservation visions, targets, and strategies to ensure the conservation of freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide. © 2007 The Authors.",2007,"2019-06-28 13:29:32","2019-06-28T13:29:32Z",NA,"341–352","","",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch3; conservation assessment; conservation biogeography; conservation status; freshwater biodiversity; freshwater conservation planning; integrated river basin management; protected area gap analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper presents a quantification of the biomass burned in large-scale as well as small-scale human-induced vegetation fires at the country level for the year 2000. The amount of biomass burned in large scale fires is estimated combining information on the amount of biomass destroyed by large vegetation fires each year, derived by remote sensing, with estimates about the fraction induced by human activities. For biomass flows resulting from shifting cultivation, no comprehensive information is available at the global scale. Therefore, this flow was modelled on the basis of data on the area subjected to shifting cultivation and assumptions about the typical length of the cropping and fallow periods and the amount of biomass destroyed in each rotation cycle. The results show that the amount of biomass consumed in anthropogenic vegetation fires ranges between 3.5 and 3.9 billion tons dry matter per year (Pg dm/yr), a considerable amount when compared to the global socioeconomic biomass harvest of 12 Pg dm/yr. One third of the biomass consumed in anthropogenic fires each year, 1.0-1.4 Pg dm, results from shifting cultivation. Anthropogenic fires are most important in the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa (2202 Tg dm/yr), Latin America (795 Tg dm/yr), South-Eastern Asia (336 Tg dm/yr) and Central Asia (157 Tg dm/yr), whereas in regions dominated by industrialized countries, anthropogenic vegetation fires play a minor role. Due to the lack of consistent and spatially explicit data for the year 2000, these numbers do not include agricultural residues burned in the field. The inclusion of residue burning in the year 1985 would increase the total biomass consumed by 0.45 Pg dm to a total of between 4.0 and 4.4 Pg dm/yr. The paper shows that the current geographic pattern of biomass burning can be explained by a combination of natural factors, such as the type of the potential vegetation, and socioeconomic factors, such as population density and the degree of industrialization of a region, which ultimately determine the application of vegetation fires in land use management. It is expected that the magnitude of anthropogenic vegetation fires will decrease in absolute and relative terms, mainly due to population growth and the diffusion of modern land use technologies, which more and more replace the function of vegetation fires as a land management tool. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although different types of uncertainty limit our capacity to assess this risk, Earth system scientists are particularly concerned about tipping elements, large-scale components of the Earth system that can be switched into qualitatively different states by small perturbations. Despite growing evidence that tipping elements exist in the climate system, whether large-scale vegetation systems can tip into alternative states is poorly understood. Here we show that tropical grassland, savanna and forest ecosystems, areas large enough to have powerful impacts on the Earth system, are likely to shift to alternative states. Specifically, we show that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration will force transitions to vegetation states characterized by higher biomass and/or woody-plant dominance. The timing of these critical transitions varies as a result of between-site variance in the rate of temperature increase, as well as a dependence on stochastic variation in fire severity and rainfall. We further show that the locations of bistable vegetation zones (zones where alternative vegetation states can exist) will shift as climate changes. We conclude that even though large-scale directional regime shifts in terrestrial ecosystems are likely, asynchrony in the timing of these shifts may serve to dampen, but not nullify, the shock that these changes may represent to the Earth system.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:29:22","2019-06-28T13:29:22Z",NA,"209–212","","7410",488,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22763447",NA,NA,NA,"19th Century; 20th Century; 21st Century; Africa; Atmosphere; Atmosphere: chemistry; Biological; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Dioxide: analysis; Carbon Dioxide: metabolism; Carbon: metabolism; Climate Change; Climate Change: statistics & numerical data; Ecosystem; Fires; Geography; History; Hot Temperature; Models; Photosynthesis; Photosynthesis: physiology; Poaceae; Poaceae: growth & development; Poaceae: metabolism; Probability; Rain; Stochastic Processes; Time Factors; Trees; Trees: growth & development; Trees: metabolism; Used in AfRA Ch3; Wood",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied pollination patterns of the African mahogany, Entandrophragma cylindricum (Sapelli). We investigated two plots in Cameroon corresponding to three tree densities: unlogged forest (Ndama 2002), a mildly logged forest 1 year after logging (Ndama 2003) and a severely logged forest 30 years after logging (Dimako). We used four microsatellite markers to perform paternity analysis. Selfing remained below 2% in all treatments. Pollen flow was mainly long distance but with some proximity effects. Average observed within-plot pollination distances were 338, 266 and 385 m, and pollination by trees outside the plots was 70% (Ndama 2002), 74% (Ndama 2003) and 66% (Dimako). Despite sampling a limited number of seeds from a limited number of mother trees, we obtained seeds sired by 35.6-38.3% of the potential within-plot pollen donors. While trees 20 cm in diameter contributed to pollination, results in Dimako suggest that individual larger trees contribute more to pollination than small ones. This effect was not detected in the other treatments. The results suggest extensive pollen flow in Sapelli.

However, most hypotheses on past vegetation dynamics relied on palaeobotanical records, an approach lacking spatial resolution, and on current patterns of species diversity and endemism, an approach confounding history and environmental determinism. In this context, a comparative phylogeographic study of rainforest species represents a complementary approach because Pleistocene climate fluctuations may have left interpretable signatures in the patterns of genetic diversity within species. Using 1274 plastid DNA sequences from eight tree species (Afrostyrax kamerunensis, A. lepidophyllus, Erythrophleum suaveolens, Greenwayodendron suaveolens, Milicia excelsa, Santiria trimera, Scorodophloeus zenkeri, Symphonia globulifera) sampled in 50 populations of Atlantic Central Africa (ACA), we averaged divergence across species to produce the first map of the region synthesizing genetic distinctiveness and standardized divergence within and among localities. Significant congruence in divergence was detected mostly among five of the eight species and was stronger in the northern ACA. This pattern is compatible with a scenario of past forest fragmentation and recolonization whereby forests from eastern Cameroon and north-eastern Gabon would have been more affected by past climate change than those of western Cameroon (where one or more refugia would have occurred). By contrast, southern ACA (Gabon) displayed low congruence among species that may reflect less drastic past forest fragmentation or a more complex history of vegetation changes. Finally, we also highlight the potential impact of current environmental barriers on spatial genetic structures. This article is protected by copyright.

WET-health is an indicator-based rapid wetland assessment approach developed in South Africa. It allows determining the conditions of wetlands in four assessment modules (hydrology, geomorphology, vegetation, and water quality) by observing the degree of deviation of a wetland from its anticipated natural reference state. We tested the transferability of the WET-health concept for East African inland valley swamps and floodplain wetlands based on 114 assessment units at four study sites. Due to large wetland areas and different environmental settings in East Africa, we modified the original approach using a random selection of assessment units and an assessment scheme based on disturbance types (Appendices A and B). Estimated WET-health impact scores were matched with biophysical and socioeconomic variables using a generalized linear mixed model. Land use included largely undisturbed wetland units occurring side by side with seasonally cropped or grazed units, and drained, permanently cultivated units. A strong differentiation of impact scores between the four assessment modules was apparent with highest scores for vegetation and lowest scores for geomorphology. Vegetation and water quality responded most sensitively to land use changes. The magnitude of wetland disturbance is predominantly determined by management factors such as land use intensity, soil tillage, drainage intensity, and the application of agrochemicals and influences vegetation attributes and the provision of ecosystem services. The proposed modification of WET-health enables users to assess large wetland areas during relatively short periods of time. While further studies will be required, WET-health appears to be a promising concept to be applied to wetlands in East Africa and possibly beyond.",2016,"2019-06-28 13:28:51","2019-06-28T13:28:51Z",NA,"684–692","","",67,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"East Africa; Flooding regime; Land use; Wetland health; Wetland monitoring",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Human population growth in coastal areas, including estuaries, is expected to increase considerably in coming decades, which will result in a proliferation of infrastructure such as jetties, wharfs and marinas. This infrastructure is often associated with artificial night lighting, yet the implications of these unnatural lighting regimes for the fish fauna in coastal ecosystems are unknown. * We conducted novel, night-time surveys of the fish community directly adjacent to an artificial structure using an acoustic camera (didson). By manipulating the artificial lighting conditions (lighting either ‘on' or ‘off'), we tested the effects of artificial light on fish abundance and behaviour. * Clear differences in the abundance of fish were observed between the two light treatments. The occurrence of large-bodied predators (\textgreater500 mm TL) increased when the artificial lights were on. The behaviour of these fish also differed as they attempted to maintain their position within the illuminated area adjacent to the associated anthropogenic structure. The abundance of small shoaling fish also increased when the lights were on. * It is possible that the conditions created by artificial lighting benefit piscivores through the concentration of prey and enhanced foraging capabilities in the case of visual predators. This has the potential to create unnatural top–down regulation of fish populations within urban estuarine and coastal waters. * Synthesis and applications. As a consequence of a positive phototaxic response, the findings of this study suggest that artificial light often associated with man-made structures has the potential to alter fish communities within urban estuarine ecosystems by creating optimal conditions for predators. Future coastal developments should consider the ecological implications of lighting on aquatic communities. We recommend that lighting be minimized around coastal infrastructure and the use of red lights, which have limited penetration though water, be considered.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:28:50","2019-06-28T13:28:50Z",NA,"43–50","","1",50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Artificial lighting; Didson; Predators; Schooling; South Africa; Urbanization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Series B, Biological sciences","","0962-8436","10.1098/rstb.2011.0105","","Current levels of endangerment and historical trends of species and habitats are the main criteria used to direct conservation efforts globally. Estimates of future declines, which might indicate different priorities than past declines, have been limited by the lack of appropriate data and models. Given that much of conservation is about anticipating and responding to future threats, our inability to look forward at a global scale has been a major constraint on effective action. Here, we assess the geography and extent of projected future changes in suitable habitat for terrestrial mammals within their present ranges. We used a global earth-system model, IMAGE, coupled with fine-scale habitat suitability models and parametrized according to four global scenarios of human development. We identified the most affected countries by 2050 for each scenario, assuming that no additional conservation actions other than those described in the scenarios take place. We found that, with some exceptions, most of the countries with the largest predicted losses of suitable habitat for mammals are in Africa and the Americas. African and North American countries were also predicted to host the most species with large proportional global declines. Most of the countries we identified as future hotspots of terrestrial mammal loss have little or no overlap with the present global conservation priorities, thus confirming the need for forward-looking analyses in conservation priority setting. The expected growth in human populations and consumption in hotspots of future mammal loss mean that local conservation actions such as protected areas might not be sufficient to mitigate losses.

The aim of this study is to assess the possibility that human activities promoted the spread of taxa with edible fruit into dry Sudano-Sahelian areas during high-rainfall periods in the climate cycle. West African savannas (Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin). Cultivated savanna parklands and adjacent forests and transitional landscapes were inventoried at 27 sites in five countries. All trees with basal diameters \textgreater 10 cm were counted within 500-m(2) belt transects. Species composition and abundance were contrasted between three landscape classes to assess the degree of influence exerted by traditional human management. Twentieth century rainfall data were averaged for two sets of weather stations encompassing the north-south range of typical parkland tree species. Rainfall trends were used to evaluate the putative impact of climate change on edible and/or succulent fruit species at the northern limit of the parkland savanna zone. Species composition and spatial distribution data indicate that the parkland ecosystem is significantly shaped by human activities. Indigenous land management favours edible-fruit-yielding taxa from the wetter Sudanian and Guinean vegetation zones over Sahelian species. Rainfall isohyets at the northern range limits of parkland species shifted southwards in the late 20th century, crossing the critical 600-mm mean annual rainfall threshold for Sudanian flora. Relict vegetation and historical records indicate that the Sudanian parkland system extended in the past to near 15 degrees N latitude in middle West Africa, compared with 13.5 degrees N today. The current loss of mesic trees in the Sudano-Sahel zone appears to be driven by the sharp drop in rainfall since the 1960s, which has effectively stranded anthropogenically distributed species beyond their rainfall tolerance limits.",2009,"2019-06-28 13:28:35","2019-06-28T13:28:35Z",NA,"1181–1193","","6","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agroforestry; Archaeobotany; Desertification; Drought; Guinean zone; Landscape ecology; Parklands; Savanna; Senescence; Sudanian zone",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present report refers to forest landscapes, ecosystems, species, and genes, and considers the diversity of structure, function, and composition existing at each level. Scale is also considered in a second sense, including global, regional and local (or national), required to report activities and outcomes that address the issue of maintenance of biological diversity in forests Determining the current global status of forest biological diversity is somewhat problematic because of difficulties in quantifying biological diversity in a meaningful fashion. Describing biological diversity on the local or national scale for most countries may not be entirely possible, and even in countries that attempt to report on biological diversity, data on indicators are usually not well developed. Further, the extent and rate of changeof the world's forests are still unclear, especially at the national level, and long-term trends are distorted by the lack of solid baseline data and inconsistent use of terms. Where forest inventory data do exist, in both the developed and developing world, the information is often outdated, of poor quality and is especially difficult to compare among regions because the data sources, as well as the definitions of forests and forest types, differ.

Where forest inventory data do exist, in both the developed and developing world, the information is often outdated, of poor quality and is especially difficult to compare among regions because the data sources, as well as the definitions of forests and forest types, differ. The present report uses the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) definition of forests, which has been set for the monitoring of global changes in forest cover and allows comparison between countries. There is not complete global agreement with the FAO definition of “forest”. However, based on those FAO data, 3,869 million ha of global forest remain in 2000, and there has been decline in the forest area by ca. 9.4 million ha (0.22 per cent) annually since 1990, of which most was primary forest in the tropics. Preliminary estimates show that net deforestation rates have slightly increased in tropical Africa, remained constant in Central America, and declined slightly in tropical Asia and South America. The establishment of plantation forests and reforestation activities in temperate and boreal forests of some industrialized countries have increased and led to a decline in deforestation rates in those biomes. In the tropical biome, the rate of plantation establishment has increased dramatically during the last decade. However, the Group noted that plantation forestry cannot fully compensate for deforestation of primary forest in terms of biological diversity, especially in the tropics or in temperate regions, where exotic, rapidly growing tree species have most often replaced the original forest types. FAO's assessments do not encompass forest quality aspects (e.g. no clear distinction between primary and secondary forests, nor among different types of plantations), making an assessment of the quality of global forests difficult.",2002,"2019-06-28 13:28:32","2019-06-28T13:28:32Z",NA,"1–152","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch3",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) provides one mechanism for tracking progress toward such goals in three particular areas: primary forest area, protected forest areas, and areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity. In this paper, we quantify current area and trends in forest areas designated for the conservation of biodiversity, protected forest areas, and primary forests by country and biome; and examine the association between total forest area and measures of protection, per-capita income, and population. The overall findings suggest that countries are increasingly protecting forests of ecological significance at the global scale (7.7% of forests were protected in 1990 rising to 16.3% in 2015), with a strong upward trend in protected areas in the tropical domain (from 12% in 1990 to 26.3% in 2015). However, primary forest area has declined by 2.5% globally and by 10% in the tropics over the period 1990-2015 (using data for countries that reported in all years). Given that many species in the tropics are endemic to primary forests, losses in that climatic domain continue to be of concern, although the rate of decline appears to be slowing.Using multiple regression analysis, we find that a 1% increase in protected area or area designated for biodiversity conservation within a country is associated with an increase in total forest area in that country of about 0.03% (p\textless 0.05). A 1% within-country increase in population density and per capita GDP are associated with a decrease in forest area of about 0.2% (p\textless 0.01) and an increase in forest area of about 0.08% (p\textless 0.05) respectively. Our findings also indicate that, since FRA is used as one mechanism for tracking progress toward goals like the AICHI Biodiversity Targets, country correspondents may require additional assistance toward reporting on primary forest, protected forest, and biodiversity conservation statistics.",2015,"2019-06-28 13:28:28","2019-06-28T13:28:28Z",NA,"68–77","","","352",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation; FRA 2015; Global Forest Resource Assessment; Primary forest; Protected areas; Used in AfRA Ch3",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The 2.2 Ma of volcaniclastic infill can be divided into time-slices using dated tuffs. Sediments were deposited in a semi-arid, closed rift basin containing a shallow saline-alkaline lake until ∼1.75 Ma. Four trenches in uppermost Bed I sample a ∼20 ka time-slice between Ng'eju Tuff (base, 1.818 ?? 0.006 Ma) and Tuff IF (top, 1.803 ?? 0.002 Ma). They form a ∼1 km transect of the lake margin flat that contains both stacked and cumulative paleosols that are interpreted as a heterogeneous paleocatena. Closer to the lake, paleosols are thinner, vertically stacked, and separated by thin tuffs or tufa. Further from the lake margin, there is additional volcaniclastic input, and paleosols are thicker and cumulative. Macroscale and micromorphological features identify these clay-rich paleosols as paleo-Vertisols. Abundant pedogenic slickensides and a variety of ped shapes were observed in the field, as well as micro-ped structures and stress cutans in thin section. Although weakly developed, these paleo-Vertisols also have distinct horizons defined by soil color changes, differing ped shapes, and bulk geochemistry and are indicative of monsoonal precipitation seasonality.Paleosols and parent materials were analyzed for bulk geochemistry of major, rare, and trace elements. Geochemical proxies reveal changing hydrology not definitively identifiable in the field or micromorphology. Molecular weathering ratios show increased weathering, and mass-balance calculations indicate greater translocations (positive and negative) through time. Lower soil moisture due to a drier climate likely created better-drained conditions allowing for increased pedogenesis. The records of FeMn oxides and zeolites precipitated in rhizoliths are further evidence for changing redox conditions and water chemistry. Redox-sensitive elements such as Fe and Mn were mobilized during saturated soil conditions and precipitated during drier conditions. As the hydrology changed due to increased aridity, zeolites precipitated as rhizoliths due to capillary rise and evaporative pumping of saline-alkaline water. The fluctuating hydrology identified in the paleo-Vertisols deposited between 1.79 and 1.81 Ma is indicative of a precession cycle and consistent with records from Olduvai Gorge and throughout East Africa. This 20 ka time-slice of the 2 Ma drying trend identified in Africa coincides with the first hominin migrations out of Africa at ∼1.8 Ma and suggests that hominins were living in a water-stressed environment with annual precipitation seasonality and large variations in precipitation due to precession. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:28:25","2019-06-28T13:28:25Z",NA,"78–94","","","322-323",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch3",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ensembles reproduce fairly well the observed climate zones, although with some notable discrepancies. CORDEX and HIRES provide realistic fine-scale information which enhances that from the coarser-scale CMIP5, especially in the Gulf of Guinea encompassing marked landcover and topography gradients. The late 21st century projections reveal an extension of torrid climates throughoutWest Africa. In addition, the Sahel, predom- inantly semi-arid in present-day conditions, is projected to face moderately persistent future arid climate. Similarly, the Gulf of Guinea shows a tendency in the future to experience highly seasonal semi-arid conditions. Finally, wet and moist regions with an extreme seasonality around orographic zones become less extensive under future climate change. Consequently, West Africa evolves towards increasingly torrid, arid and semi-arid regimes with the recession of moist and wet zones mostly because of the temperature forcing, although precipitation can be locally an important factor. These features are common to all multimodel ensembles, a sign of robustness, with few disagreements in their areal extents, and with more pronounced changes in the higher-resolution RCM projections. Such changes point towards an increased risk of water stress for managed and unmanaged ecosystems, and thus add an element of vulnerability to future anthropogenic climate change for West African water management, ecosystem services and agricultural activities.",2016,"2019-06-28 13:28:22","2019-06-28T13:28:22Z",NA,"241–253","","1-2","134",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present taphonomic study reveals the second-largest collection of hominin-modified bones from Olduvai, with abundant cut marks found on most of the anatomical areas preserved. Meat and marrow exploitation is reconstructed using the taphonomic signatures left on the bones by hominins.

In the last six years, the four main soybean growing countries comprising Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay recorded a 92% increase in production and 66% increase in planted area. World production of palm oil, the most widely traded edible oil, has also seen significant leaps in production and planted areas; production had almost doubled from 1990 to 2001, with Malaysia and Indonesia contributing to most of the increased production. The rapid expansion of both crops had resulted in the conversion of High Conservation Value Forests1 (HCVFs) in South America, including parts of the Amazon and in South-East Asia. As world production of palm oil and soyoil is expected to continue to increase at the current pace, there is a growing concern that this expansion would result in conversion of a large proportion of the remaining HCVFs in the tropics. In order to provide a better understanding of various issues pertaining to forest conversion and the edible oils sector, a study was undertaken on the supply chain of the palm oil industry in Malaysia. The study is divided into two sections, Part A gives an overview of the palm industry and the players in the supply chain while Part B provides detailed information on the various players",2002,"2019-06-28 13:27:58","2019-06-28T13:27:58Z",NA,"145","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"AMAZON; AMERICA; AREA; AREAS; Argentina; Biofuels; Brazil; CONSERVATION; CONVERSION; CROPS; CULTIVATION; Expansion; FOREST; Global; Growing; HCVF; INFORMATION; Indonesia; MALAYSIA; Overview; PROPORTION; Paraguay; SOUTH-AMERICA; South America; South-east Asia; Southeast Asia; Soybean; TROPICS; Used in AfRA Ch3; WORLD; asia; bolivia; conservation value; crop; industry; oil; oil palm; palm oil; production; seed; studies; value",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"November",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"GIWZL6DU","report",2014,"FAO","Global plan of action for the conservation, sustainable use and development of forest genetic resources","","","","","","Forest genetic resources (FGR) are the heritable materials maintained within and among tree and other woody plant species that are of actual or potential economic, environmental, scientific or societal value. They are crucial to the adaptation and protection of our ecosystems, landscapes and production systems, yet are subject to increasing pressures and unsustainable use. At its 11th session in June 2007, the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture emphasized the urgent need to conserve and sustainably use FGR, and included a report on The State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources in its Multi-Year Programme of Work. On the basis of the information and knowledge compiled by FAO for The State of World's Forest Genetic Resources, the Commission developed the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation, Sustainable Use and Development of Forest Genetic Resources, adopted by the FAO Conference at its 38th session in June 2013. This Global Plan of Action identifies 27 strategic priorities grouped into 4 areas: 1) improving the availability of, and access to, information on FGR; 2) conservation of FGR (in situ and ex situ); 3) sustainable use, development and management of FGR; 4) policies, institutions and capacity-building. Implementation of the Global Plan of Action will strengthen the sustainability of the management of FGR while contributing towards the Millennium Development Goals, the post-2015 agenda and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. While primary responsibility for implementation lies with governments, FAO has a strong commitment to supporting countries in these efforts, working with governments and other partners at the national, regional and international levels and in line with FAO's Reviewed Strategic Framework approved by its Member States. Indeed, the Global Plan of Action is an integral part of FAO's efforts to realize its Strategic Objective 2, to “increase and improve provision of goods and services from agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a sustainable manner”.

However, given the inherent inadequacies of these PAs to cater for all species in conjunction with the effects of climate change and human pressures on PAs, the future of biodiversity depends heavily on the 88 % of land that is unprotected. The study of biodiversity patterns and the processes that maintain them in human-modified landscapes can provide a valuable evi- dence base to support science-based policy-making that seeks to make land outside of PAs as amenable as possible for biodiversity persistence. We discuss the literature on biodi- versity in sub-Saharan Africa's human-modified landscapes as it relates to four broad ecosystem categorizations (i.e. rangelands, tropical forest, the Cape Floristic Region, and the urban and rural built environment) within which we expect similar patterns of biodi- versity persistence in relation to specific human land uses and land management actions. Available research demonstrates the potential contribution of biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes within all four ecosystem types and goes some way towards providing general conclusions that could support policy-making. Nonetheless, conserva- tion success in human-modified landscapes is hampered by constraints requiring further scientific investment, e.g. deficiencies in the available research, uncertainties regarding implementation strategies, and difficulties of coexisting with biodiversity.

In traditional paleoecology, sediment-based pollen provides a means to define preanthropogenic impact conditions, but problems in establishing the exact provenance and ecologically meaningful levels of taxonomic resolution of the evidence are limiting. We explored the extent to which the use of sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) may complement pollen data in reconstructing past alpine environments in the tropics. We constructed a record of afro-alpine plants retrieved from DNA preserved in sediment cores from 2 volcanic crater sites in the Albertine Rift, eastern Africa. The record extended well beyond the onset of substantial anthropogenic effects on tropical mountains. To ensure high-quality taxonomic inference from the sedaDNA sequences, we built an extensive DNA reference library covering the majority of the afro-alpine flora, by sequencing DNA from taxonomically verified specimens. Comparisons with pollen records from the same sediment cores showed that plant diversity recovered with sedaDNA improved vegetation reconstructions based on pollen records by revealing both additional taxa and providing increased taxonomic resolution. Furthermore, combining the 2 measures assisted in distinguishing vegetation change at different geographic scales; sedaDNA almost exclusively reflects local vegetation, whereas pollen can potentially originate from a wide area that in highlands in particular can span several ecozones. Our results suggest that sedaDNA may provide information on restoration targets and the nature and magnitude of human-induced environmental changes, including in high conservation priority, biodiversity hotspots, where understanding of preanthropogenic impact (or reference) conditions is highly limited.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:27:43","2019-06-28T13:27:43Z",NA,"446–455","","2","28",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24372820",NA,NA,NA,"Albertine Rift; High-elevation biodiversity; Lake sediment; Metabarcoding; SedaDNA; Used in AfRA Ch3; Vascular plants; Virunga volcanoes",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description.

Our analysis revealed that forest-value categories fall under a range of ecosystem services and are therefore clustered accordingly. The distinction between instrumental and intrinsic values indicates the broad spectrum on which local people conceive the benefits they derive from the forest. This article discusses the interconnection between instrumental and intrinsic forms of forest value and the important role played by intrinsic values in promoting well-being and conservation. It also addresses the nature of the capabilities that are based on the perceived forest values. Two conclusions are drawn. First, local population's views on valuable natural elements serve to indicate what they consider important for the achievement of well-being.

"UVBHC8X5","journalArticle",1999,"Hackel, Jeffrey D","Community Conservation and the Future of Africa ' s Wildlife","Conservation Biology","","","","","Abstract: 7he term community-based conservation (CBC) refers to wildlife conservation efforts that involve ruralpeople as an integralpart of a wildlife conservation policy. The key elements of such programs are that local communities participate in resource planning and management and that they gain economically from wildlife utilization. In part, CBC is seen as an alternative to the more exclusionary protectionist policies of the past, which often alienated rural people from conservation efforts. The new approach acts to make rural people a constituency for wildlife and therefore active backers of wildlife protection. Africans, however, are struggling with severe social and economic problems such as poverty, long-standing economic stagnation, rapid population growth, and environmental deterioration. Because of the pressures that Africans face in making a living, the application of CBC may not occur as readily or as successfully as its advocates would hope. It may also be that the approach is being oversold. I use brief case studies from Madagascar, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland to highlight the possible conflicts between rural people's economic needs and the implementation of community conservation. In addition, the CBC literature treats the role of protection vaguely, as it does the question of what might happen if CBC fails to achieve wildlife conservation goals. Community-based conservation is an obvious advance over past practices because of its inclusive philosophy, but if rural people accept CBC because of its economic benefits, they may reject it at some point in the future if a better economic alternative is presented. Tbus, CBC programs can work to produce a better relationship between wildlife and people, but only a vast improvement in the lives of rural Africans will ultimately pro- duce a more secure future for the continent's wildlife.

A review for managers and policy makers","Biodiversity and Conservation","","09603115","10.1007/s10531-005-6232-9","","Conservation managers and policy makers must often justify the need for protection of biodiversity. However, results of scientific studies testing for a positive value of biodiversity in terms of community stability and ecosystem function have been complex and inconsistent. We review recent information on the consequences of loss of biodiversity for natural systems. The relationships described vary with scale of interest - for instance, biodiversity at local scales typically has strong effects on ecosystem function, although the opposite relationship is often found at regional scales. These inconsistencies lead to some concern as to whether these relationships can be used to justify biodiversity protection. This is particularly relevant to policy, where holistic protection of biodiversity has most often been mooted and justified. For managers, who most often work to protect single species, communities or ecosystem functions, biodiversity research has failed to address questions of critical concern such as consequences of the loss of rare species or the identification of functional keystone species. For the general public, we believe that the confusion and debate surrounding biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships is in danger of eroding the positive value society places on biodiversity. We further warn that using those relationships in policy documents as justifications for biodiversity protection is fraught with difficulties. Finally, we contend that biodiversity research has largely not addressed issues of concern to conservation managers, and list a set of priorities for relevant research on the consequences of biodiversity loss.",2007,"2019-06-28 13:26:54","2019-06-28T13:26:54Z",NA,"1359–1378","","5","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Ecosystem function; Policy; Social; Species loss; Stability; Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is based on cognitive and geospatial mapping and augmented by barrier and overlap analysis. It is illustrated with data collected from Tibetan and Qiangic speakers in Eastern Kham. The research is predicated on 15 forest-related concepts and resulted in four cognitive categories and five well-defined geographical areas within which forest values were similar enough to warrant a particular conservation approach. Changes in forest values coincided with changes in underlying biophysical phenomena and there was a significant directional trend of forest value data along a NE to SW axis. This method can be applied to the care of natural sacred sites and forests for the enhancement of biocultural diversity. diversity.

EGS change over space and time as a result of changing patterns of land use or changes in the composition and structure of different vegetation types. Spatio-temporal assessment of EGS can provide valuable information on the consequences of changing land use and land cover for EGS and helps to deal with this complexity. We carried out a quantitative and qualitative appraisal of selected EGS (timber production, carbon stock, provision of water, water regulation, biodiversity, and forage production) to understand how these have altered in a complex mosaic of landscape that has undergone significant change over the past 200 years.Land use and land cover types and their associated EGS were assessed and mapped using a wide range of readily available data and tools. We also evaluated the trade-offs among services associated with observed land use change. In contrast to work elsewhere, we found the recent changes in land use and land cover have an overall positive impact on various EGS due mainly to the conversion of pasture to managed plantations which are connected to the larger areas of remnant vegetation. Results also indicate that there was a high level of variation in the distribution of the EGS across the landscape. Relatively intact native vegetation provides mainly regulating services whereas the modified landscapes provides provisioning services such as timber and forage production at the cost of regulating services. Rapidly changing demand and supply of certain goods and services (e.g., timber, pulp or carbon) may also have positive and negative impact on other services. For example, increasing plantation rotation has positive impacts for biodiversity and carbon stock but reduces stream flow and water yield. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2013","2019-06-28 13:26:24","2019-06-28T13:26:24Z",NA,"35–45","","",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Carbon; Land use change; Mapping; Trade-offs; Used in AfRA Ch2; Water",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.","2005","2019-06-28 13:26:16","2019-06-28T13:26:16Z",NA,"","1–100","",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1196/annals.1439.003 PMID: 2472066",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most tree species have occasional uses, but a few are exceptionally useful and thus their levels of utilization may far exceed their regeneration and production. The questionnaire survey indicated that 62% of the respondents agreed that traditional medical services were more available than modern sen ices. Utilization surveys indicated that wooden poles are the building,material used in 98% of the dwellings and storage structures, wild foods were useful for food security especially during drought years, and high quality timber trees have been depleted in the forest because of earlier exploitation by pit-sawing. The distribution of ethnobotanical knowledge indicated that muck of the relevant ethnobotanical and utilization information was held by more aged members of the society and hence there is a clear need to capture this knowledge before it is lost, This study has shown that resources are defined by use and culture, and some components of ethnobotanical knowledge have potential for the sustainable management of miombo woodlands.","2000","2019-06-28 13:26:06","2019-06-28T13:26:06Z",NA,"328–343","","3",54,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 4480",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2; aspects of plants; been documented ade-; in tanzania have not; indigenous knowledge; miombo woodlands; participatory rural appraisal; tan-; the uses and ethnobotanical; tree use values; zania",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The inclusion of communities as one of the five Strategic Objectives in the World Heritage Convention reflects an increasing demand for community engagement at all stages of the World Heritage process, and for rights-based approaches that link conservation and sustainable development. A new addition to the World Heritage Papers series provides guidance and introduces tools for best practice in engaging indigenous and local communities in World Heritage. Engaging Local Communities in Stewardship of World Heritage draws on over a decade of experience of the Community Management of Protected Areas for Conservation (COMPACT) initiative at eight natural World Heritage Sites in countries of Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia, and on emerging experience at two new sites. COMPACT thus far has been a joint initiative of the UNDP-implemented Global Environmental Facility Small Grants Programme (SGP) and the United Nations Foundation, with partners including the UNESCO World Heritage Centre. COMPACT has developed an innovative model for engaging communities in conservation and shared governance of World Heritage sites and other globally significant protected areas. It offers a unique example of best practice in this area, tested at site-level in eight very different settings representing a variety of geographic regions. Recognizing its potential value for other World Heritage sites, SGP and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre are now collaborating on a series of activities to support replication and/or adaptation of the COMPACT model in new sites, including a number of World Heritage sites in Africa. This publication provides guidelines, illustrated with case-studies. Recognizing the importance of community engagement throughout the life of a World Heritage site, it considers all stages of the World Heritage process. It reflects on lessons learned, discusses the application of the methodology in new settings and offers recommendations going forward. World Heritage Paper 40 was launched in mid-November 2014 at the World Parks Congress in Sydney, Australia. This publication was prepared in collaboration with the UNDP/GEF Small Grants Programme and was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Government of Spain (AECID) and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands.","2014","2019-06-28 13:25:53","2019-06-28T13:25:53Z",NA,"","116","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2; community participation; cultural heritage; environmental management; natural heritage; nature conservation; participatory development",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the use of socio-economic surveys, from February to July 2006, we established that the amount of the annual fuel-wood harvest for five study sites was about 102,650 m3 (i.e., an amount equivalent to clearing about 205.3 ha of mangrove forests annually). It is estimated that approximately 62% of this total is used to smoke most of the fish (i.e., about 90.7% of the fish landings) across the five study sites. The quantities of wood seemed to vary proportionately with fish landings across sites, hence indicating a probable direct correlation between mangrove wood harvested and its use in fish smoking. The different uses of mangrove wood were similar in all sites, but the quantities of wood extracted from different sites varied, with sites of high fish landings registering the highest fuel-wood turnover. It seemed that local people were unaware of the need to maintain ecosystem functions despite the close relationship between wood and fish harvesting, and their importance in ensuring the livelihood for local population in the study areas.

Life is neither possible nor worth living without all the goods and services we derive from biodiversity, including, inter alia, the provision of our food and medicines, spiritual and cultural fulfilment, water and air purification, crop pollination, erosion control and the regulation of climate and natural disasters. Whether or not we continue to de- rive benefits from biodiversity will depend upon how we use it and how our activities impact our natural environment. Recent scientific assessments document that unsustainable use of the goods and services we derive from ecosystems, for example through deforestation, overexploitation of natural resources and unplanned urbanization, has led to biodiversity loss and degrada- tion of ecosystem services with increasingly serious consequences for the future of nature and human well- being, food security, healthcare and human society in general. ... Te strategic vision of how humans can live sustainably at the heart of the dynamic ecological systems that support life on Earth is reflected in many traditional socio-ecological production landscapes, such as the Japanese land-management practice of satoyama. Tis publication presents case studies and articles that describe relationships between humans and nature in socio-ecological production landscapes around the world. Te examples highlight the various physical structures, management techniques and governance sys- tems that characterize these landscapes, as well as the benefits they provide for biodiversity, the threats they currently face, and ways to address these threats. We hope that the international community can learn from such enlightened practices and adapt them, as appropriate, to current global changes. ...","2010","2019-06-28 13:25:40","2019-06-28T13:25:40Z",NA,"","184","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bi-ology, of course, provides us with the theoretical and an-alytic tools to identify rare and threatened species and eco-systems. Biology also enables us to estimate the limits to human use necessary to sustain these systems. Our fail-ure to understand these basic (though often extraordi-narily complex) issues sometimes leads to conservation policies and practices ill-suited to addressing the prob-lems they were intended to solve. More often, however, we get the biology right, but our conservation interven-tions still fail to sustain target species and ecosystems. The disconnect between our biological knowledge and conservation success has led to a growing sense among scientists and practitioners that social factors are often the primary determinants of success or failure. Although it may seem counterintuitive that the foremost influences on the success of environmental policy could be social , con-servation interventions are the product of human decision-making processes and require changes in human behavior to succeed. Thus, conservation policies and practices are inherently social phenomena, as are the intended and un-intended changes in human behavior they induce. Recognizing that conservation is about people as much as it is about species or ecosystems — an acknowledge-ment seldom explicitly made in conservation circles — suggests a significant shift in the nature and use of science in conservation. To preserve the earth's natural heritage, the social sciences must become central to conservation science and practice. Political science, anthropology, eco-nomics, psychology, sociology, geography, legal studies, and other social science disciplines all have analytic tools and established knowledge that can explain and predict patterns of human behavior—insights vital to the success of local, national, and international conservation efforts. In the development and management of protected areas, for example, the social sciences can complement the bio-logical sciences in critical ways. Environmental economics can often provide a powerful rationale for the establishment of protected areas by demonstrating that the value of goods and services generated by intact ecosystems exceeds that of a fragmented or transformed landscape. Anthropological re-search can document the sociocultural and spiritual value of biodiversity. Together with other social science disciplines, anthropology can also identify the conservation-oriented cultural beliefs, values, norms, and rules that are often well suited to serve as the foundation for the formal laws and reg-ulations that govern protected areas. Finally, drawing upon the rich literature on the governance of "" commons "" —for-ests, fisheries, wildlife and the like—the social sciences can provide valuable insights into how decision-making arrange-ments, resource use rights, monitoring and enforcement systems, and conflict resolution mechanisms shape individ-ual use of, and thus the state of, protected areas. Protected areas are not unique. Across the full range of issues that face the conservation community today, the so-cial sciences can contribute greatly to the development and implementation of lasting solutions by answering criti-cal questions. Which policy initiatives most effectively curb the illegal bushmeat trade? How should public aware-ness programs be designed to reflect learning differences across age groups? In what markets are ecolabeling pro-grams best suited to create the economic incentives for sustainable fisheries? What cultural beliefs and values drive the international trade in endangered species for medici-nal purposes?

Because it is yet an evolving sector, the sustainability of bioenergy production in different regions is very elusive. Experiences show that bioenergy policies in one region can have impacts not only on its own but also on other regions' social, economic and ecological sustainability. It is thus important to assess development pathways for bioenergy to exploit the potential benefits and forestall any unnecessary costs. This paper frames a novel hybrid approach for assessing bioenergy potentials for regions with diverging economic, social and ecological systems. The approach is based on a conceptual framework that takes into account trade-offs decisions on sustainability goals and production options in the assessment of bioenergy pathways. It combines different empirical techniques for the systematic investigation of trade-offs and pathways including fuzzy logic, conjoint, logit, and path analyses. To show the relevance and utility of these techniques for the integrated assessment of trade-offs and pathways in bioenergy development, we illustrated their application using results and data from previous related studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These ecosystem processes are controlled by both the diversity and identity of the plant, animal, and microbial species living within a community. Human modifications to the living community in an ecosystem as well as to the collective biodiversity of the earth can therefore alter ecological functions and life support services that are vital to the well-being of human societies. Substantial changes have already occurred, especially local and global losses of biodiversity. The primary cause has been widespread human transformation of once highly diverse natural ecosystems into relatively species-poor managed ecosystems. Recent studies suggest that such reductions in biodiversity can alter both the magnitude and the stability of ecosystem processes, especially when biodiversity is reduced to the low levels typical of many managed systems.

To address this challenge, strategies that enable judicious management of social- ecological systems in the face of substantive uncertainty are needed. Several such strategies are emerging from the developing body of work on complexity and resilience. We identify and discuss four strategies, providing practical examples of how each strategy has been applied in innovative ways to manage turbulent social-ecological change in South Africa and the broader region: (1) employ adaptive management or comanagement, (2) engage and integrate different perspectives, (3) facilitate self-organization, and (4) set safe boundaries to avoid system thresholds.

The solution to this three-part dilemma is often seen by going backward, so to speak (1) loss of bio- diversity can be stemmed if (2) farmers stop clearing nat- ural habitat, which can be done if (3) agricultural produc- tion is intensified on land already devoted to agricultural production. The seemingly inescapable conclusion is that intensifying agriculture already underway is the main so- lution to the problem of biodiversity loss (Green et al. 2005). We argue that this seemingly impeccable frame- work is wrong and that a more realistic framing suggests a view of conservation that is distinct from more tradi- tional forms. In our viewthis more-realistic framing must acknowledge the conservation consequences of the agri- cultural matrix in a landscape framework. Here, we focus on the issue of land-use policies, es- pecially on the ecological relationship between natural areas and the surrounding agricultural matrix. The way the problem is frequently framed, as a zero-sum game where competition for land is divided between produc- tion and conservation, is wrong, as noted by Angelsen and Kaimowitz (2001 and chapters therein). The prob- lem with this framing is that it tacitly assumes a closed system. What normally happens in practice is that when agriculture is intensified in one corner of the world, that very intensification acts as a magnet to attract more pro- ducers to the area, which actually leads to more habitat conversion, as demonstrated by Angelson and Kaimowitz (2001). The simple three-part logical sequence is theoret- ically sound but only within the framework of its own as- sumptions, which apparently are mainly incorrect in the real world (i.e., few if any on-the-ground situations actu- ally represent a closed system) (Vendermeer & Perfecto 2005). We suggest that a more useful framing must recognize that (1) in some areas native habitat destruction is cur- rently underway and (2) in other areas native habitat de- struction has run its course. In the first situation the focus is properly on deterrence of future natural habitat con- version. But in the second situation there is a tendency to focus on the patches of natural habitat, thinking of the converted habitats as destroyed and thus of little inter- est to conservation. Placing this second category on the back burner is lamentable given what is nowunderstood about ecology at a large scale. When framed properly a vision of conservation emerges that shifts the focus from the remaining patches of natural habitat to the matrix in which they occur.","2007","2019-06-28 13:25:23","2019-06-28T13:25:23Z",NA,"274–277","","1",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17298536",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite growing research over the last decade, cultural services assessment still remains arbitrary and is largely limited to marketable services such as tourism. Evident difficulties in standardizing definitions and measurements have challenged cultural services accounting in decision making processes. However, the imminent formation of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services offers an opportunity to counterbalance this misrepresentation by establishing a scientific basis for consistently assessing cultural services. In that regard, the current review intends to facilitate discussion investigating the current state of cultural services accounting by offering an appraisal of existing evidence regarding cultural services indicator quality. The review builds on scientifically recognized frameworks to develop a holistic understanding of how cultural services indicators are conceived within ecosystem services research. Among the measures found, benefit indicators were most frequently used for assessing inspirational, educational and recreational services. A broad variety of methods for accounting cultural services was found, mainly due to the varied aims of the studies. Most of the cultural services indicators were deficient concerning their clarity of definitions, purposes and understanding of the processes to be measured and referring only marginally to tradeoffs and bundles with other services. Only 17% performed multitemporal assessments and 23% used spatially explicit information. It seems that indicator quality could be greatly enhanced by investing more effort toward involving relevant stakeholders in conceptualization and communication phases, using participatory mapping tools to enhance visibility. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","2013","2019-06-28 13:25:22","2019-06-28T13:25:22Z",NA,"434–444","","",29,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Accounting; Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Eco; Millennium ecosystem assessment; Non-material values; Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Central to this debate are the problem of how to identify conservationist behavior and the issue of whether sound management of common property is likely to evolve. While social scientists have documented instances of restraint in the use of resources, those who adopt an evolutionary perspective are challenged to identify the selective mechanisms whereby such altruistic conservation acts might be maintained in a population. Here a game-theoretical approach is used to analyze the case of pastoralist grazing reserves. We demonstrate that under some conditions conservation can be the result of narrow self-interest and there is no collective-action problem. However, the range of these conditions is much broader for wealthy individuals, and thus the wealthy may also find it advantageous to coerce others into conserving. In conclusion, we propose an extension of the definition of conservation that is of greater generality for use in nonforaging populations and incorporates the essential political element of how conflicts over resource use are resolved.","1999-12","2019-06-28 13:25:07","2019-06-28T13:25:07Z",NA,"621–652","","5",40,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 10539943",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2; collective action; cultural anthropology; leadership; prestige; punishmen; punishment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago, at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the world's nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth's ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate.

Effective indicators can help to identify and quantify the sustainability attributes of bioenergy options. We identify 16 socioeconomic indicators that fall into the categories of social well-being, energy security, trade, profitability, resource conservation, and social acceptability. The suite of indicators is predicated on the existence of basic institutional frameworks to provide governance, legal, regulatory and enforcement services. Indicators were selected to be practical, sensitive to stresses, unambiguous, anticipatory, predictive, estimable with known variability, and sufficient when considered collectively. The utility of each indicator, methods for its measurement, and applications appropriate for the context of particular bioenergy systems are described along with future research needs. Together, this suite of indicators is hypothesized to reflect major socioeconomic effects of the full supply chain for bioenergy, including feedstock production and logistics, conversion to biofuels, biofuel logistics and biofuel end uses. Ten indicators are highlighted as a minimum set of practical measures of socioeconomic aspects of bioenergy sustainability. Coupled with locally prioritized environmental indicators, we propose that these socioeconomic indicators can provide a basis to quantify and evaluate sustainability of bioenergy systems across many regions in which they will be deployed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper contributes to emerging critiques by focusing on the implications of intracommunity dynamics and ecological heterogeneity. It builds a conceptual framework highlighting the central role of institutions - regularized patterns of behavior between individuals and groups in society - in mediating environment-society relationships. Grounded in an extended form of entitlements analysis, the framework explores how differently positioned social actors command environmental goods and services that are instrumental to their well-being. Further insights are drawn from analyses of social difference; 'new', dynamic ecology; new institutional economics; structuration theory, and landscape history. The theoretical argument is illustrated with case material from India, South Africa and Ghana.","1999","2019-06-28 13:24:59","2019-06-28T13:24:59Z",NA,"225–247","","2",27,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 491475",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The new framework combined poverty alleviation strategies with an attempt to shift rural communities away from subsistence-oriented agriculture to more market-oriented development options. While many of those who are currently assessing the impact of these policies in rural areas have focused on the extent to which they have contributed towards the creation of 'sustainable livelihoods', relatively little attention has been given to their impact on rural social relations and identity politics. This paper seeks to fill this gap by focusing on transformations in gender relations and identity politics in one rural location in the Eastern Cape. It argues that, although the new initiatives have been unevenly implemented and have not significantly reduced poverty in this area, they have nevertheless activated new discourses around identity and development. The paper traces these changing discourses by comparing and contrasting the polarised identity politics associated with the introduction of agricultural betterment in the 1950s and the increasingly hybrid identities and strategies constructed by rural women, in particular, in response to the new development opportunities. The paper concludes by investigating the implications of these responses for gender and power relations in the village.

The majority of relationships between attributes and ecosystem services cited in the 530 studies were positive. For example, the services of water quality regulation, water flow regulation, mass flow regulation and landscape aesthetics were improved by increases in community and habitat area. Functional traits, such as richness and diversity, also displayed a predominantly positive relationship across the services, most commonly discussed for atmospheric regulation, pest regulation and pollination. A number of studies also discussed a positive correlation with stand age, particularly for atmospheric regulation. Species level traits were found to benefit a number of ecosystem services, with species abundance being particularly important for pest regulation, pollination and recreation, and species richness for timber production and freshwater fishing. Instances of biodiversity negatively affecting the examined ecosystem services were few in number for all ecosystem services, except freshwater provision. The review showed that ecosystem services are generated from numerous interactions occurring in complex systems. However, improving understanding of at least some of the key relationships between biodiversity and service provision will help guide effective management and protection strategies.","2014","2019-06-28 13:24:22","2019-06-28T13:24:22Z",NA,"191–203","","",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Attribute; Biodiversity; Ecosystem function; Ecosystem service; Network analysis; Trait; Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The application of that research for conservation and decision-making can be hampered by the ambiguity found in the definition of the nursery function under the ecosystem service perspective. In this paper, we review how the role of nursery habitats is included in the ecosystem services literature, covering conceptual, biophysical and economic reflections. The role of ecosystems as nurseries is mostly analyzed in coastal environments. The main observation is that there is no consensus on the consideration of the nursery function as a service (e.g. which species or habitats) or on how to assess it (e.g. which indicators or valuation methods). After that review, we analyze three different interpretations given to the nursery function, namely the ecological, conservationist and economic point of view; and we distinguish between different types of assessment that may consider the nursery function. We conclude that the nursery function can be considered an ecosystem service on its own right when it is linked to a concrete human benefit and not when it is represented with indicators of general biodiversity or ecosystem condition. Thus, the analysis of the delivery of ecosystem services should be differentiated from the analysis of ecological integrity. Only with this distinction science may be able to quantify the link between biodiversity and ecosystem services and policy may be effective in halting biodiversity loss. Similar considerations could apply for other biodiversity constituents that may be treated as ecosystem services.",2016,"2019-06-28 13:24:20","2019-06-28T13:24:20Z",NA,"249–257","","","63",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystem assessments; Ecosystem services; Fisheries; Nursery habitats; Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, no study has estimated the year of peak rate for multiple resources and investigated the relationships among them. We exploit time series on the appropriation of 27 global renewable and nonrenewable resources. We found 21 resources experienced a peak-rate year, and for 20 resources the peak-rate years occurred between 1960-2010, a narrow time window in the long human history. Whereas 4 of 7 nonrenewable resources show no peak-rate year, conversion to cropland and 18 of the 20 renewable resources have passed their peak rate of appropriation. To test the hypothesis that peak-rate years are synchronized, i.e., occur at approximately the same time, we analyzed 20 statistically independent time series of resources, of which 16 presented a peak-rate year centered on 2006 (1989-2008). We discuss potential causal mechanisms including change in demand, innovation and adaptation, interdependent use of resources, physical limitation, and simultaneous scarcity.

Beginning in the early 1980s, conservation biologists adapted neoliberal economics to reframe ecosystem functions and related biodiversity as ecosystem services to humanity. Despite the economic success of programs such as the Catskill/Delaware watershed management plan in the United States and the creation of global carbon exchanges, today's marketplace often fails to adequately protect biodiversity. We used a Marxist critique to explain one reason for this failure and to suggest a possible, if partial, response. Reframing ecosystem functions as economic services does not address the political problem of commodification. Just as it obscures the labor of human workers, commodification obscures the importance of the biota (ecosystem workers) and related abiotic factors that contribute to ecosystem functions. This erasure of work done by ecosystems impedes public understanding of biodiversity. Odum and Odum's radical suggestion to use the language of ecosystems (i.e., emergy or energy memory) to describe economies, rather than using the language of economics (i.e., services) to describe ecosystems, reverses this erasure of the ecosystem worker. Considering the current dominance of economic forces, however, implementing such solutions would require social changes similar in magnitude to those that occurred during the 1960s. Niklas Luhmann argues that such substantive, yet rapid, social change requires synergy among multiple societal function systems (i.e., economy, education, law, politics, religion, science), rather than reliance on a single social sphere, such as the economy. Explicitly presenting ecosystem services as discreet and incomplete aspects of ecosystem functions not only allows potential economic and environmental benefits associated with ecosystem services, but also enables the social and political changes required to ensure valuation of ecosystem functions and related biodiversity in ways beyond their measurement on an economic scale.",2010,"2019-06-28 13:24:16","2019-06-28T13:24:16Z",NA,"113–119","","1","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19659684",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Commodification; Conservation policy; Ecosystem function; Ecosystem service; Emergy; Neoliberal economics; Social function systems; Used in AfRA Ch2; Valuation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In general, cultural ecosystem services incentivize the multifunctionality of landscapes.

There is increasing consensus about the importance of incorporating these ""ecosystem services"" into resource management decisions, but quantifying the levels and values of these services has proven difficult. We use a spatially explicit modeling tool, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), to predict changes in ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and commodity production levels. We apply InVEST to stakeholder-defined scenarios of land-use/land-cover change in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. We found that scenarios that received high scores for a variety of ecosystem services also had high scores for biodiversity, suggesting there is little tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Scenarios involving more development had higher commodity production values, but lower levels of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However, including payments for carbon sequestration alleviates this tradeoff.

From this assertion has grown the promotion of nutrition-sensitive approaches to economic growth, development, agriculture and food systems (nutrition-specific interventions target malnutrition directly, whereas nutrition-sensitive interventions target the causes of malnutrition by integrating nutrition into policies and programs in diverse sectors). There have been repeated calls for the international community to prioritize identification ways to leverage agriculture (and agricultural landscapes) to enhance nutrition (and health). Land use change is an often overlooked driver of change in diets, nutrition and food security, especially for rural communities. The synergies between food systems approaches to food security and nutrition and landscape approaches to integrated biodiversity and forest conservation should be explored and built on. Forests and trees support food security and nutrition in a number of ways. Forests and wild biodiversity provide nutritionally important foods (including fruits, vegetables, bush meat, fish and insects), that contribute to the diversity and nutritional quality of diets of people living in heterogeneous landscapes. Forests and trees provide fuelwood, an essential and often overlooked component of the food systems in rural areas across the globe. Forests and tree products make invaluable contributions to the income of people living in and around them, often providing the only means of accessing the cash economy, thus enabling access to nutritious foods through purchasing. Forests also sustain resilience: forest products are often consumed more frequently in times of food scarcity and can provide livelihood safety nets. When they reach markets, forest and tree products can contribute to the nutrition-sensitivity of global food systems (approximately 53% of the fruit available for consumption globally is produced by trees), especially when market chains are supported and developed in a nutrition-sensitive manner. Biodiversity, forests and trees outside forests also provide an array of ecosystem services essential for the sustainability and nutriton-senstivity of agricultural systems (e.g. pollination, water provisioning, genetic resources). A better understanding of the importance of these relationships, and the spatial scales at which they function, is needed to ensure they are not overlooked in policy and practice. The importance of forests and trees in agricultural systems and the nutritional importance of forest and tree foods highlight their role in both the sustainability and nutrition-sensitivity of food systems. To achieve goals for reductions in global malnutrition it will be essential to ensure that nutrition becomes a cross-cutting issue: a priority not only in the field of health, development, education and agriculture, but for those also working in forestry and conservation.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:23:53","2019-06-28T13:23:53Z",NA,"1–25","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agricultural systems; Used in AfRA Ch2; dietary diversit; landscapes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

Ecosystem services meet the criteria of being adequate human-environmental system indicators and therefore, they are an appropriate instrument for decision-making and management.?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:23:43","2019-06-28T13:23:43Z",NA,"54–78","","","28",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem service production network; Ecosystem services; Human well-being; Indicator sets; Interactions; Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The data presented were derived from a study of the viability of rural industries based on wildlife resources from this area. A questionnaire survey was carried out amongst households close to the Conservation Area. Respondents from 182 households were interviewed. A high proportion (65%) were found to be positive towards the concept of conservation though fewer were positive towards the Conservation Area and its managers. The distribution of attitudes in the community was cross-tabulated against 14 demographic variables. It was found that positive attitudes tended to increase with increasing household affluence and with the respondent's level of education. The most and the least westernised households tended to be positive towards conservation, suggesting the influence of a traditional concept of conservation. That households which had experienced direct benefits from the Conservation Area were more positive than those which had not indicates the importance of allowing local people access to wildlife resources and of encouraging structures to integrate conservation areas within local economies. ?? 1988.",1988,"2019-06-28 13:23:34","2019-06-28T13:23:34Z",NA,"21–46","","1","45",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper operationalizes a methodological approach for ecosystem service assessment on the basis of value pluralism. We assessed eleven ecosystem services delivered in the Do??ana social-ecological system (SW Spain). We found that different ecosystem service trade-offs came into view depending the value-domain in which services were assessed. The use of different valuation methods uncovers the fact that methods to elicit value actually shape and define the values being elicited. In this context, the prevalence of biophysical and monetary value-domains in scientific literature entails two main concerns: (1) the ecosystem service concept reflect in a limited extent the concerns of their beneficiaries, and (2) ecosystem service assessment results are biased towards the information provided by markets at the expense of other value-articulating institutions. Recognizing the role of ecosystem service assessment methods as value-articulating institutions, we call for a methodological framework able to contemplate the multidimensional nature of ecosystem services. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Landscape approaches are often promoted as a win-win solution to reducing harmful impacts of development  a means to balance social needs and economic performance, while maintaining ecological function. In this respect, landscape approaches that address multiple sector needs, including agriculture, production forestry and conservation, are identified as a significant opportunity to contribute to the United Nations new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, assessing and verifying sustainability outcomes across broad, diverse and dynamic landscapes is challenging, mainly because of the lack of pragmatic and standardized means of assessment and measurement in cost-effective ways. This paper aims to advance the concept of sustainable landscape development, including ways to assess sustainability performance and to leverage the scaling-up of investment in sustainable development, as a means of achieving SDGs and other goals.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nTools and indicators used to measure sustainability outcomes are reviewed in the context of landscape investments, to identify high performing and pragmatic parameters and associated measurable indicators. Considerations include seeking parameters that are applicable to any type or size of landscape, and standardized indicators that are measurable within short time-scale and resource constraints. Based on these requirements, we develop and present a framework associated with four universally important parameters: (i) livelihoods; (ii) ecosystem services; (iii) efficient resource use; and (iv) food and non-food products. This framework will be useful to assist in measuring sustainability outcomes in landscapes and is designed to be applicable to any landscape setting. We elaborate on readily measurable indicators for each parameter group.

Biologists estimate annual loss of species at 1,000 times or more greater than historic rates, and linguists predict that 50-90% of the world's languages will disappear by the end of this century. Prior studies indicate similarities in the geographic arrangement of biological and linguistic diversity, although conclusions have often been constrained by use of data with limited spatial precision. Here we use greatly improved datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containing many of the Earth's remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas. Results indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic diversity, accounting for 70% of all languages on Earth. Moreover, the languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular regions, with many facing extinction. Likely reasons for co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary among localities, although strong geographic concordance between biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form of functional connection. Languages in high biodiversity regions also often co-occur with one or more specific conservation priorities, here defined as endangered species and protected areas, marking particular localities important for maintaining both forms of diversity. The results reported in this article provide a starting point for focused research exploring the relationship between biological and linguistic-cultural diversity, and for developing integrated strategies designed to conserve species and languages in regions rich in both.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:23:26","2019-06-28T13:23:26Z",NA,"8032–8037","","21","109",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22566626",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present paper presents an analysis of information collected from knowledgeable members of mountain communities in the State of Uttarakhand, Central Himalaya. The data collected are analyzed within the framework of traditional knowledge-based systems (TKBS) methodology, using the conservation purpose of rules and practices as a means of typifying the information on sacred natural sites (forests/groves, pastures, water bodies), on the phenomenon of dedicating forests to a deity, on the inherent taboos regarding resource exploitation, and on other traditional beliefs and customs, in order to understand the environmental and conservationist implications of these rules and practices. The analysis shows that the cultural precepts of remote Uttarakhand mountain communities can be considered a precondition for sustainable development. In fact, the association of religion with ecosystem management is inherent in traditional Himalayan communities' culture; one cannot think of ecological systems in the Himalaya without religion.

A major challenge will be how to use, and quality-assure, information derived from different knowledge systems. We test how indigenous and local knowledge on natural resources in Miskito and Mayangna communities in Nicaragua, validated through focus groups with community members, compares with information collected on line transects by trained scientists. Both provide comparable data on natural resource abundance, but focus groups are eight times cheaper. Such approaches could increase the amount and geographical scope of information available for assessments at all levels, while simultaneously empowering indigenous and local communities who generally have limited engagement in such processes.

This knowledge has accumulated through a long series of observations transmitted from generation to generation. Such ""diachronic"" observations can be of great value and complementthe ""synchronic"" observations on which western science is based. Where indigenous peoples have depended, for long periods of time, on local environments for the provision of a variety of resources, they have developed a stake in conserving, and in some cases, enhancing, biodiversity. They are aware that biological diversity is a crucial factor in generating the ecological services and natural resources on which they depend. Some indigenous groups manipulate the local landscape to augment its heterogeneity, and some have been found to be motivated to restore biodiversity in degraded landscapes. Their practices for the conservation of biodiversity were grounded in a series of rules of thumb which are apparently arrived at through a trial and error process over a long historical time period. This implies that their knowledge base is indefinite and their implementation involves an intimate relationship with the belief system. Such knowledge is difficult for western science to understand. It is vital, however, that the value of the knowledge-practice-belief complex of indigenous peoples relating to conservation of biodiversity is fully recognized if ecosystems and biodiversity are to be managed sustainably. Conserving this knowledge would be most appropriately accomplished through promoting the community-based resource-management systems of indigenous peoples.

It is the world's most arid, with 1% of the global renewable fresh water available to its population. By the 1990s, eight countries in the Middle East (Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Yemen, and Israel) had crossed the red line of “absolute water scarcity” (Engelman and LeRoy 1993; Swain 1998). The population of nearly 300 million has doubled in the last three decades and is expected to double again by 2025 (Blanche 2001). This increase will mean a massive pressure on the already scarce water resources, yet newer technologies - especially groundwater pumping devices - cannot for long keep pace with rising water demand, as they are already operating at unsustainable rates. Instead, these technologies may further deplete currently viable aquifers and preclude their use even for lower-impact sustainable traditional -irrigation systems, such as qanats (Lightfoot 1996).",2012,"2019-06-28 13:23:17","2019-06-28T13:23:17Z",NA,"149–162","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25246403",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A minority of papers discuss a relationship between knowledge integration and social-ecological system resilience, but there remains a lack of clarity and empirical evidence for such a relationship that can help distinguish how indigenous knowledge and knowledge integration contribute most to resilience.

It discusses how these cultural ecosystem services can be assessed and integrated into spatial and physical planning. The paper presents two case studies to shed light on the assessment process. A case study from Sweden combines an analysis of ecosystem services with methods for documenting cultural heritage values in landscapes. A second case study from the Arafura-Timor Seas combines an analysis of cultural ecosystem services with methods for assessment of priority environmental concerns at the seascape scale.We demonstrate that the methods from cultural heritage conservation provide tools for the analysis of historical values as well as historical drivers of change in landscapes that can add time-depth to more spatially focused ecosystem assessments. We propose that methods for valuation of cultural heritage and identity in landscapes are integrated into assessments of ecosystem services to inform policy making and physical and spatial planning for sustainable management of ecosystems and landscapes. This could also provide an approach for bringing about integrated implementation of conventions and instruments from the environmental and cultural heritage fields, respectively. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:23:09","2019-06-28T13:23:09Z",NA,"14–26","","April 2016","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cultural ecosystem services; Heritage values; Landscape; Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increasing pressures from human exploitation and habitat disturbance, however, have raised serious concerns about the potential depletion of various species. This has led to the establishment of large numbers of Fish Conservation Zones (FCZs) or ""no-take"" fish sanctuaries in southern Laos based on a ""community-based fisheries co-management"" framework. This study uses the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers to assess the effectiveness of village-managed FCZs in enhancing fish stocks in the mainstream Mekong River in Khong District, Champasak Province. Focus group interviews about species that are believed to have benefited from different FCZs are compared with parameters such as FCZ area, age, depth, localized gradient, water velocity, and the presence of wetland forests nearby. The results suggest that no one aspect is likely to account for variations in fish stocks; rather, it is the interaction between numerous factors that has the largest impact. Secondly, the results indicate that microhabitat diversity and protection are critical for maintaining and enhancing Mekong fisheries. Deep-water pools are particularly important as dry season refuges for many fish species, and FCZ depth may be the single most important environmental factor affecting the success of FCZs in the Mekong River. FCZs have the most potential to benefit relatively sedentary species, but may also benefit highly migratory species, given the right conditions. This study shows that integrated approaches to stock assessment that employ LEK and scientific fisheries management have considerable potential for improving Mekong capture-fisheries management.",2005,"2019-06-28 13:23:08","2019-06-28T13:23:08Z",NA,"439–454","","3","36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 16132441",NA,NA,NA,"Asia; Co-management; Fish sanctuaries; Marine protected areas; Small-scale fisheries; Traditional ecological knowledge; Used in AfRA Ch2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, well known unintended consequences of several biological control projects have led to concern that possible environmental benefits do not warrant inherent risks. Four risks demand attention: (1) direct attack on non-targets; (2) indirect effects on non-targets; (3) dispersal of a biocontrol agent to a new area, either autonomously or with deliberate or inadvertent human assistance; (4) changed relationships between a control agent and a native species, particularly as generated by global climate change. Procedures for assessing risk of direct attack on non-targets by phytophagous biological control agents have steadily improved and an expanded centrifugal phylogenetic approach appears to provide adequate insight. Direct non-target impacts by entomophages are more difficult to predict. Myriad possible indirect effects, some subtle but nonetheless important, present a far greater challenge, and techniques of assessing such risks are in their earliest infancy and not as closely regulated. Despite prominent examples in both the general invasion literature and that for biological control, the risk that a species, once introduced, will spread beyond its intended range, and the consequences of such spread, are not routinely treated by risk assessors. This phenomenon deserves far more attention. Global changes-especially climate change-can lead to modified ranges and efficacies of introduced biological control agents and their targets. Although many examples show that climatic niches are often not conserved, an important first routine step would be to combine climatic envelopes with general circulation models for predicted future climates. Finally, actions based on a risk assessment are always implemented in a framework of predicted costs and benefits, which are inevitably asymmetric, so it is critically important that all stakeholders, including conservationists, participate in the decision-making process.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:22:48","2019-06-28T13:22:48Z",NA,"263–276","","2","57",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Dispersal; Ecosystem impact; Indirect effect; Non-target host; Risk assessment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Though widely adopted in recent years by ecologists, conservation biologists, and environmental practitioners, the use of IS has been criticized for several reasons, notably the lack of justification behind the choice of any given indicator. In this review, we assess how ecologists have selected, used, and evaluated the performance of the indicator species. We reviewed all articles published in Ecological Indicators (EI) between January 2001 and December 2014, focusing on the number of indicators used (one or more); common taxa employed; terminology, application, and rationale behind selection criteria; and performance assessment methods. Over the last 14 years, 1914 scientific papers were published in EI, describing studies conducted in 53 countries on six continents; of these, 817 (43%) used biological organisms as indicators. Terms used to describe organisms in IS research included ""ecological index"", ""environmental index"", ""indicator species"", ""bioindicator"", and ""biomonitor,"" but these and other terms often were not clearly defined. Twenty percent of IS publications used only a single species as an indicator; the remainder used groups of species as indicators. Nearly 50% of the taxa used as indicators were animals, 70% of which were invertebrates. The most common applications behind the use of IS were to: monitor ecosystem or environmental health and integrity (42%); assess habitat restoration (18%); and assess effects of pollution and contamination (18%). Indicators were chosen most frequently based on previously cited research (40%), local abundance (5%), ecological significance and/or conservation status (13%), or a combination of two or more of these reasons (25%). Surprisingly, 17% of the reviewed papers cited no clear justification for their choice of indicator. The vast majority (99%) of publications used statistical methods to assess the performance of the selected indicators. This review not only improves our understanding of the current uses and applications of IS, but will also inform practitioners about how to better select and evaluate ecological indicators when conducting future IS research.",2016,"2019-06-28 13:22:46","2019-06-28T13:22:46Z",NA,"223–230","","","60",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecological indicators; Ecological monitoring; Environmental changes; Indicator species; Review; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is therefore timely to consider which conceptual frameworks can best support research at this nexus. Our review of frameworks synthesises existing research on poverty/environment linkages that should not be overlooked with the adoption of the topical language of ecosystem services. A total of nine conceptual frameworks were selected on the basis of relevance. These were reviewed and compared to assess their ability to illuminate the provision of ecosystem services, the condition, determinants and dynamics of poverty, and political economy factors that mediate the relationship between poverty and ecosystem services. The paper synthesises the key contributions of each of these frameworks, and the gaps they expose in one another, drawing out lessons that can inform emerging research. Research on poverty alleviation must recognize social differentiation, and be able to distinguish between constraints of access and constraints of aggregate availability of ecosystem services. Different frameworks also highlight important differences between categories of services, their pathways of production, and their contribution to poverty alleviation. Furthermore, we highlight that it is important to acknowledge the limits of ecosystem services for poverty alleviation, given evidence that ecosystem services tend to be more associated with poverty prevention than reduction. We conclude by reflecting on the relative merits of dynamic Social-Ecological Systems frameworks versus more static checklists, and suggest that research on ecosystem services and poverty alleviation would be well served by a new framework distilling insights from the frameworks we review. ?? 2013 The Authors.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:22:32","2019-06-28T13:22:32Z",NA,"1098–1111","","5","23",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conceptual framework; Ecosystem services; Human wellbeing; Poverty alleviation; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Deviation from the norm may serve as a proxy assessment of land degradation and improvement – if other factors that may be responsible are taken into account. These other factors include rainfall effects which may be assessed by rain-use efficiency, calculated from NDVI and rainfall. Results from the analysis of the 23-year Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI data indicate declining rain-use efficiency-adjusted NDVI on ca. 24% of the global land area with degrading areas mainly in Africa south of the equator, South-East Asia and south China, north-central Australia, the Pampas and swaths of the Siberian and north American taiga; 1.5 billion people live in these areas.

However, despite projections that world urban populations will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km(2), nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr(-1)), equal to ∼5% of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urbanization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global impacts of projected urban expansion will require significant policy changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:22:26","2019-06-28T13:22:26Z",NA,"16083–16088","","40","109",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 22988086",NA,NA,NA,"Carbon pools; Land-cover; Urban expansion; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In light of these threats, questions remain about how societies on the forest fringe who depend on provisioning services affect plant functional traits. This study assessed the relationship between plant functional traits, forest-dependent societies and provisioning ecosystem services along a forest-agriculture matrix gradient in tropical humid forests of Madagascar. Data were collected for six functional traits and six provisioning services. We evaluated functional diversity (FD) and utilitarian diversity (FD of provisioning services) along disturbance gradients. We also determined the traits most susceptible to loss along the gradient as well as the relationship between functional traits and provisioning services. The results showed that FD, utilitarian diversity and species richness decreased significantly across all modified habitats. There was a distinct suite of traits absent from intensely used habitats and those same traits were associated with the two most important provisioning services in the region (firewood and construction). The activities of people living on the forest fringe seem to be a strong selective force on trait loss in plant communities, which in turn will influence future species assembly and trait diversity and distribution. Moreover, this study suggests that it is possible to predict trait loss from plant communities in forests where degradation is mediated primarily through subsistence agriculture and resource extraction. Conservation efforts should recognize that forest degradation and deforestation are contextually specific, determined mostly by people's efforts to maintain their basic livelihood, and therefore necessitate local-scale interventions that feed into landscape-scale policy initiatives. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:22:17","2019-06-28T13:22:17Z",NA,"118–127","","","161",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Functional diversity; Functional traits; Land use intensification; Madagascar; Subsistence agriculture; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This integration can be achieved by including ecosystembased adaptation (EBA) or nature-based solutions2 to climate change, valuing the many benefits nature provides to people, and including such values in economic decision-making. Ecosystems underpin all of the resources and goods upon whichhumans depend and therefore are critical for securing human wellbeing. Investing in ecosystems can bring both local and global benefits providing the dual goals of supporting local communities, helping them cope with and adapt to a changing climate, and helping to mitigate global climate impacts depending on implemented practices. This brief is aimed at the general public, politicians, businesses and organisations that influence the development of policies and strategies in economics, climate change mitigation and adaptation, poverty alleviation, natural resource use and biodiversity conservation. The aim is to stimulate discussion and debate as to how societies can avoid degrading the natural environment and the wealth of valuable benefits it provides, and instead promote and utilise healthy ecosystems to support a sustainableand more climate-resilient future for people around the world.

We define keystone and burden communities as communities with impacts disproportionately large (positive or negative respectively) relative to their weight in the metacommunity. We show how a simple metric, based on the effects of single-community removals, can characterise communities along a 'keystoneness' axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with examples from two different theoretical models. We further distinguish environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants of keystoneness.

No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. Methods We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years; DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. Findings In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7 0% [95% uncertainty interval 6 2-7 7] of global DALYs); tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 3% [5 5-7 0]), and alcohol use (5 5% [5 0-5 9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7 9% [6 8-9 4]), household air pollution from solid fuels; (HAP; 7 0% [5 6-8 3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 1% [5 4-6 8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10 0% (95% UI 9 2-10 8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water ' and sanitation accounting for 0 9% (0 4-1 6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. Interpretation Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:22:07","2019-06-28T13:22:07Z","","2224–2260","","9859","380",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23245609",NA,NA,NA,"Disease burden; Global scale; Poverty; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Convention on Biological Diversity and other international and national policy agreements have set broad goals for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss. However, efforts to conserve biodiversity cannot be effective without comprehensive metrics both to assess progress towards meeting conservation goals and to account for measures that reduce pressures so that positive actions are encouraged. We developed an index based on a global assessment of the condition of marine biodiversity using publically available data to estimate the condition of species and habitats within 151 coastal countries. Our assessment also included data on social and ecological pressures on biodiversity as well as variables that indicate whether good governance is in place to reduce them. Thus, our index is a social as well as ecological measure of the current and likely future status of biodiversity. As part of our analyses, we set explicit reference points or targets that provide benchmarks for success and allow for comparative assessment of current conditions. Overall country-level scores ranged from 43 to 95 on a scale of 1 to 100, but countries that scored high for species did not necessarily score high for habitats. Although most current status scores were relatively high, likely future status scores for biodiversity were much lower in most countries due to negative trends for both species and habitats. We also found a strong positive relationship between the Human Development Index and resilience measures that could promote greater sustainability by reducing pressures. This relationship suggests that many developing countries lack effective governance, further jeopardizing their ability to maintain species and habitats in the future.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:22:05","2019-06-28T13:22:05Z","","","","4","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23593188",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity status; Human development index; Resilience; Used in AfRA CH1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is the case for the genus Prosopis (mesquite; Fabaceae) where several taxa are among the world's most damaging invasive species. Many contentious issues ('conflicts of interest') surround these taxa, and management interventions have not yet sustainably reduced the negative impacts. There is an urgent need to better understand the factors that drive invasions and shape management actions, and to compare the effectiveness of different management approaches. This paper presents a global review of Prosopis, focusing on its distribution, impacts, benefits and approaches to management. Prosopis was found to occur in a 129 countries globally and many more countries are climatically suitable. All areas with naturalized or invasive Prosopis species at present are suitable for more taxa and many Asian and Mediterranean countries with no records of Prosopis are bioclimatically suitable. Several Prosopis species have substantial impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and local and regional economies in their native and even more so in their invasive ranges; others provide multiple benefits to local communities. Management efforts are underway in only a small part of the invaded range. Countries where more research has been done are more likely to implement formal management than those where little published research is available. Management strategies differ among countries; developed nations use mainly mechanical and chemical control whereas developing nations tend to apply control through utilization approaches. A range of countries are also using biological control.

Yet ecological understanding of ecosystem services is quite limited. Previous work maps the supply and demand for services, assesses threats to them, and estimates economic values, but does not measure the underlying role of biodiversity in providing services. In contrast, experimental studies of biodiversity-function examine communities whose structures often differ markedly from those providing services in real landscapes. A bridge is needed between these two approaches. To develop this research agenda, I discuss critical questions and key approaches in four areas: (1) identifying the important 'ecosystem service providers'; (2) determining the various aspects of community structure that influence function in real landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3) assessing key environmental factors influencing provision of services, and (4) measuring the spatio-temporal scale over which providers and services operate.

Recently, wideranging claims have been made to the effect that environmen- tal degradation will increase resource scarcity and therefore contribute to an increase in armed conflict. So far, there has been much controversy and little relevant systematic study of this phenomenon. Most scholarship on the relationship between resources, the environment, and armed conflict suffers from one or more of the following problems: (1) there is a lack of clarity over what is meant by 'environ- mental conflict'; (2) researchers engage in definitional and polemical exercises rather than analysis; (3) important variables are neglected, notably political and economic factors which have a strong influence on conflict and mediate the influence of resource and environmental factors; (4) some models become so large and complex that they are virtually untestable; (5) cases are selected on values of the dependent variable; (G) the causality of the relationship is reversed; (7) postulated events in the future are cited as empirical evidence; (8) studies fail to distinguish between foreign and domestic conflict; and (9) con- fusion reigns about the appropriate level of analysis.

Its pods can be used as livestock food and are fed upon by native herbivores. It has good timber and shade and quickly turns bare arid environments green. These qualities rendered it an attractive candidate for aridland environmental rehabilitation programmes. In the 80s and early 90s it was a preferred species in afforestation, fuel-energy and fodder programmes in Kenya's Turkana and Baringo districts and North Eastern Province. Prosopis however produces masses of pods containing small tough smooth seeds. When pods are eaten by livestock, seeds pass easily through the gut. Once in the soil, seeds can lie dormant for long, till good conditions return. Prosopis is deep-rooted and coppices well when cut above ground. These factors make it highly invasive and hard to control once established. Research was carried out to determine the spread of Prosopis juliflora over time in Kenya and its effect on livelihoods and biodiversity. It was evident that barely three decades since the first herbarium specimen was collected in 1977 from Coast Province, the species was now found in seven of Kenya's eight provinces. It was more aggressive in aridlands of the north where it formed thorny impenetrable thickets especially along water courses, flood plains, roadsides and in inhabited areas. It was encroaching upon paths, dwellings, irrigation schemes, crop farms and pastureland, significantly affecting biological diversity and rural livelihoods. Three sites, Baringo in the Rift Valley, Garissa between Coast and North Eastern Provinces and Loiyangalani in Eastern Province were chosen for detailed studies covering economic importance, perceptions, effect on biodiversity and what it would take to manage the spread of prosopis. Of the 18 positive attributes mentioned, charcoal making and fodder were most important. 24 negative attributes were mentioned. Of these, invasion of pastureland, cropland and homesteads was ranked first followed by the harmful effects of the thorns. The significance of each attribute however varied across and within the sites. In all three sites, there was significantly more plant diversity outside prosopis thicket than within it. The average labour cost of clearing a prosopis thicket 3-4 yrs old in a plot 10x10 m was found to range from Ksh 1000 (US$ 13) in Loiyangalani and Ksh 1200 in Baringo to Ksh 2,800 in Garissa. It was evident that in areas where prosopis was well established, it was beyond the community's ability to control its expansion. Prosopis invasion had reduced the capacity of pastoralists to keep large herds of livestock in affected areas. The impact among pastoralist communities has led to frequent lawsuits, pitting communities in Baringo District against government. Their source of livelihood undermined, they had turned to the very prosopis as a source of income, mainly poles, charcoal and pods. On perception, an overwhelming majority in all sites (64% in Garissa, 78.6% in Loiyangalani and 67% in Baringo) said life would be better without prosopis. Despite the stand of the affected local communities, the environmentalists, scientists and development workers were still divided on prosopis matters. Future scenarios indicated further expansion that will not only affect people's livelihoods but also key sectors of the economy such as tourism. It is evident that Kenya's vast arid and semi-arid lands totalling 80% of land area are at risk and the longer the wait, the more difficult it will be to control or eradicate the species. A comprehensive policy on prosopis is proposed.",2009,"2019-06-28 13:21:49","2019-06-28T13:21:49Z","","33–50","","2-3","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Arid ecosystem; Invasive alien species; Local livelihoods; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this article we present a framework that provides a context from which to examine the relationship between environmental changes and disease transmission and a structure from which to unite disparate pieces of information from a variety of disciplines. METHODS: The framework integrates three interrelated characteristics of environment-disease relationships: a) Environmental change manifests in a complex web of ecologic and social factors that may ultimately impact disease; these factors are represented as those more distally related and those more proximally related to disease. b) Transmission dynamics of infectious pathogens mediate the effects that environmental changes have on disease. c) Disease burden is the outcome of the interplay between environmental change and the transmission cycle of a pathogen. RESULTS: To put this framework into operation, we present a matrix formulation as a means to define important elements of this system and to summarize what is known and unknown about the these elements and their relationships. The framework explicitly expresses the problem at a systems level that goes beyond the traditional risk factor analysis used in public health, and the matrix provides a means to explicitly express the coupling of different system components. CONCLUSION: This coupling of environmental and disease transmission processes provides a much-needed construct for furthering our understanding of both specific and general relationships between environmental change and infectious disease.",2007,"2019-06-28 13:21:47","2019-06-28T13:21:47Z","","1216–1223","","8","115",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17687450",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental change; Infectious disease; Interdisciplinary; System theory; Transmission dynamics; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the majority of countries have adopted the view that global warming must be limited to \textless2 °C, current GHG emission rates and nonagreement at Copenhagen in December2009 increase the likelihood of this limit being exceeded by 2100. Extensive evi- dence has linked major changes in biological systems to 20th cen- tury warming. The “Global 200” comprises 238 ecoregions of exceptional biodiversity [Olson DM, Dinerstein E (2002) Ann Mo Bot Gard 89:199–224].Weassess the likelihood that, by 2070, these iconic ecoregions will regularly experience monthly climatic condi- tions that were extreme in 1961–1990. Using \textgreater600 realizations from climate model ensembles, we show that up to 86% of terres- trial and 83% of freshwater ecoregions will be exposed to average monthly temperature patterns \textgreater2 SDs (2σ) of the 1961–1990 base- line, including 82% of critically endangered ecoregions. The entire range of 89 ecoregions will experience extreme monthly temper- atures with a local warming of\textless2 °C. Tropical and subtropical ecor- egions, and mangroves, face extreme conditions earliest, some with \textless1 °C warming. In contrast, few ecoregions within Boreal Forests and Tundra biomes will experience such extremes this cen- tury. On average, precipitation regimes do not exceed 2σ of the baseline period, although considerable variability exists across the climate realizations. Further, the strength of the correlation between seasonal temperature and precipitation changes over nu- merous ecoregions. These results suggest many Global 200 ecore- gions may be under substantial climatic stress by 2100. climate",2011,"2019-06-28 13:21:44","2019-06-28T13:21:44Z","","2306–2311","","6","108",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21262825",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch1; climate impacts; climate model ensemble; conservation B",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A fairly large amount of bioprospecting activities have been generated but - apparently - few with a commercial intent and thus with few examples and low amounts of monetary benefits. Research on ABS has mainly been theoretical and less research has been conducted on ABS in practice.

A G20-mandated High Level Panel (HLP) on Infrastructure, working in close cooperation with Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), submitted its report and final recommendations to the French G20 Summit in November 2011. In order to close Africa's energy infrastructure gap, the panel emphasises large-scale public-private partnership (PPP) projects in order to promote economic growth and regional integration. The panel asserts that new investments into the continent's energy sector are long overdue. This is true. However, this article takes issue with the HLP's call for delivering solutions with an entire focus on large-scale, centralised energy infrastructure projects.

Such dynamism involves constantly changing advantages and disadvantages to different groups of people, which not surprisingly can lead to armed conflict, and all too frequently to war. Many governments have contributed to conflict, however inadvertently, by nationalizing their forests, so that traditional forest inhabitants have been disenfranchised while national governments sell the rights to trees in order to earn foreign exchange. Biodiversity-rich tropical forests in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Indochina, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Central and West Africa, the Amazon, Colombia, Central America and New Caledonia have all been the sites of armed conflict in recent years, sometimes involving international forces. Forests have sometimes been part of the cause of conflict (as in Myanmar and Sierra Leone) but more often victims of it. Violent conflicts in temperate areas also typically involve forests as shelters for both civilians and combatants, as in the Balkans. While these conflicts have frequently, even invariably, caused negative impacts on biodiversity, peace can be even worse, as it enables forest exploitation to operate with impunity. Because many of the remaining forests are along international borders, international cooperation is required for their conservation. As one response, the concept of international ""Peace Parks"" is being promoted in many parts of the world as a way of linking biodiversity conservation with national security.

One of the main issues surrounding the provision of such data is that sources vary in quality, scope, and accuracy. Publishers of such data must face the challenge of maximizing quality, utility and breadth of data coverage, in order to make such data useful to users. With the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we recently conducted a content needs assessment survey to consolidate and synthesize major user needs regarding biodiversity data. We find a broad range of recommendations from the survey respondents, principally concerning issues such as data quality, bias, and coverage, and ease of access. We recommend a candidate set of actions for the GBIF that fall into three classes: 1) addressing data gaps, data volume, and data quality, 2) aggregating data types that are relatively new to GBIF, to support emerging new applications, and 3) promoting ease-of-use and providing incentives for wider use. Addressing the challenge of providing high quality primary biodiversity data potentially can serve the needs of national and international biodiversity initiatives. These include the “flexible framework” for addressing the new 2020 biodiversity targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the global biodiversity observation network (GEO BON) and the new Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

We define land degradation as a long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, which may be assessed using long-term, remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Deviation from the norm may serve as a proxy assessment of land degradation and improvement – if other factors that may be responsible are taken into account. These other factors include rainfall effects which may be assessed by rain-use efficiency, calculated from NDVI and rainfall. Results from the analysis of the 23-year Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI data indicate declining rain-use efficiency-adjusted NDVI on ca. 24% of the global land area with degrading areas mainly in Africa south of the equator, South-East Asia and south China, north-central Australia, the Pampas and swaths of the Siberian and north American taiga; 1.5 billion people live in these areas. The results are very different from previous assessments which compounded what is happening now with historical land degradation.

This could be achieved with ecological indicators, if they can be easily and routinely measured and are representative of the complexity of the restored ecosystems. We used peatlands restored after horticultural peat extraction in eastern Canada to test a methodological approach that predicts restoration success early after restoration implementation. The goal of restoration of these extracted peatlands is to re-establish a moss carpet typically dominated by Sphagnum mosses, the main peat-accumulating plant group in these northern ecosystems. Vegetation in a total of 152 plots in 41 peatlands restored after peat extraction activities and distributed across a span of 600 km was monitored every 2 years since the third year after restoration. The plots were clustered in three restoration outcome categories: Sphagnum-dominated, bare peat-dominated and Polytrichum-dominated, according to their characteristic vegetation composition at the time of the latest survey for each plot (4-11 years since restoration). Second, vegetation composition in the same plots from the earliest survey, 3 years since restoration, and key environmental and management variables such as summer temperature, effectiveness of ditch blockage, season of restoration works and delay in P fertilization were analyzed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to obtain the combination of parameters that best discriminated between the restoration outcome categories. LDA correctly classified 71% of the plots of a calibration database (for which 75% of the sectors were used) and 75% of a validation database (for which 25% of the sectors were used) into the three categories. The obtained LDA models can be used to allocate new plots to one of the restoration outcome categories by providing a series of linear equations (classification functions) that are computed from the combination of ecological indicators. One additional and recently restored peatland was used to illustrate application of these equations of the LDA model to predict future restoration outcome and subsequently adapt management strategies. Such a LDA model provides an unequivocal (i.e., one new plot assigned to one and only one restoration outcome category) prediction of success based on multiple but simple, easily recognizable indicators and spares managers the complex task of interpreting many individual predictors for establishing a clear diagnosis. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:21:21","2019-06-28T13:21:21Z","","156–166","","","46",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Indicator value (IndVal); Ombrotrophic peatlands; Peat extraction; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It also explores how the taxonomic endeavour could benefit from studies of invasive species. We review the literature on the current situation in taxonomy with a focus on the challenges of identifying alien plant species and explore how this has affected the study of biological invasions. Biosecurity strategies, legislation dealing with invasive species, quarantine, weed surveillance and monitoring all depend on accurate and rapid identification of non-native taxa. However, such identification can be challenging because the taxonomic skill base in most countries is diffuse and lacks critical mass. Taxonomic resources are essential for the effective management of invasive plants and incorrect identifications can impede ecological studies. On the other hand, biological invasions have provided important tests of basic theories about species concepts. Better integration of classical alpha taxonomy and modern genetic taxonomic approaches will improve the accuracy of species identification and further refine taxonomic classification at the level of populations and genotypes in the field and laboratory. Modern taxonomy therefore needs to integrate both classical and new concepts and approaches. In particular, differing points of view between the proponents of morphological and molecular approaches should be negotiated because a narrow taxonomic perspective is harmful; the rigour of taxonomic decision-making clearly increases if insights from a variety of different complementary disciplines are combined and confronted. Taxonomy plays a critical role in the study of plant invasions and in turn benefits from the insights gained from these studies.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:21:20","2019-06-28T13:21:20Z","","1–25","","","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biological invasions; DNA barcoding; Detecting new invasions; Invasive plants; Karyology; Management; Species identification; Taxonomy; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Population data and satellite images for two time periods a decade apart were obtained and analyzed, and several measures of urban extent and expansion among them the built-up area of cities and the average density of the built-up area were calculated. Data for 90 cities out of the global sample of 120 is presented and analyzed in this report. Weighted averages of the built-up area and the average density, as well as compactness and contiguity measures and their change over time are presented for nine regions, four income groups and four city size groups covering the entire globe. Densities in developing-country cities were found to be some three times higher than densities in cities in industrialized countries, and densities in all regions were found to be decreasing over time. If average densities continue to decline at the annual rate of 1.7% as they have during the past decadethe built-up area of developing-country cities will increase from 200,000 km2 in 2000 to more than 600,000 km2 by 2030, while their population doubles. Ten econometric models that sought to explain the variation in urban extent and expansion in the universe of cities were constructed, and several hypotheses postulated by neoclassical theories of urban spatial structure were tested. All tests yielded R2 values in excess of 0.80. The policy implications of the analysis are presented and discussed. The Central message of this study is quite clear: Developing country cities should be making realistic yet minimal plans for urban expansion, designating adequate areas for accommodating the projected expansion, investing wisely in basic trunk infrastructure to serve this expansion, and protecting sensitive land from incursion by new urban development.",2005,"2019-06-28 13:21:11","2019-06-28T13:21:11Z","","1–207","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The World Bank Disclaimer:","Washington D.C",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1038/nature09440 PMID: 16286400",NA,NA,NA,"Gloabl Urban Growth; Urban density; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The AMCEN Bureau requested then its Secretariat to facilitate the preparation of a guidebook - Addressing Climate Change Challenges in Africa: A Practical Guide towards Sustainable Development. The Guidebook aims to translate available climate science analysis and current international climate policies into practical implementation in Africa in the context of sustainable development. In this regard the guidebook focuses on analysis of potential climate change impacts in key sectors in Africa and appropriate adaptation and mitigation options. It informs on matters related to governance, technological, financial and capacity building needs and opportunities on the continent with relevance to sustainable development. It provides information that has been synthesized and integrated from relevant IPCC and UN reports and other documentation on emerging issues on environment, climate change and development. It provides guidance and practical advice on how to address climate change issues in the development and implementation of actions leading to sustainable development.

In view of this we will strive to achieve a land-degradation neutral world...."" This paragraph sets a goal of maintaining a world where the total amount of degraded land remains constant, and that would secure the currently available productive land for the use of present and future generations.This article examines the challenges of operationalizing this concept of Zero Net Land Degradation (ZNLD) and its global derivative, a land degradation neutral world (LDNW).First, the concept and need for ZNLD is introduced and explained. Then we look at the expectations from ZNLD/LDNW targets within the context of promoting the recognition of land degradation as a global threat and contributing to global food security. Next we elaborate the challenges in making ZNLD operational, including: scoping (determining the spatial scale and the selected domain for which land degradation neutrality is to be achieved); mapping (classifying the lands by their current use and state of their productivity); prescribing (prescribing management practices relevant to each of the land classes); applying the selected land management (for either reducing degradation, restoring productivity, or increasing resilience); and monitoring management and its outcome.We then examine the enabling environment necessary to capture ZNLD opportunities and address the technical challenges facing the operationalization of ZNLD. The article concludes with recommendations for the way forward: first, recognize existing projects suitable for ZNLD testing and establish new pilot projects at the local community or landscape scales; and the second, seek recognition and support for achieving ZNLD at the global scale through the United Nations system.",2015,"2019-06-28 13:21:03","2019-06-28T13:21:03Z","","5–13","","PA","112",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Desertification; Land degradation; Restoration; Sustainable development goals; UNCCD; Used in AfRA Ch1; Zero Net Land Degradation",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The spatial patterns of this diversity have been well explored. We can group the species into a set of biogeographical regions (largely co-incident with regions defined for terrestrial vertebrate groups). Furthermore, we know that the diversity is unevenly distributed, with southern Africa (especially the south-western tip) disproportionally species rich, while the West African interior is disproportionally species poor. However, the origins of this diversity have only been explored for two anomalous African Floras (the Tropic-alpine Flora and the Cape Flora), whereas the origins of the diversity of the other floras are still unknown. Here I argue that six floras, with distinct geographical centers, different extra-African affinities, ages of radiation and radiation rates, can be delimited: the Austro-temperate, Tropic-alpine, Lowland forest, Tropic-montane, Savanna and Arid Floras. The oldest flora may be the Lowland forest Flora, and the most recent is the Tropic-alpine, which probably evolved during the Plio-Pleistocene on the summits of the East Africa volcanoes. My results suggest that the most rapidly radiating flora is the Austro-temperate Flora, while the other floras are all diversifying at more or less the same rate, this is also consistent with the current massive species richness in this flora (about half of the African species richness). The Austro-temperate Flora appears to be related to the floras of the other southern continents, the Tropic-alpine Flora to that of the Northern Hemisphere, and the four tropical floras to the tropical regions of the other continents, consistent with the theory of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Current African diversity may be the result of the sequential adding of new floras to the continent. Possibly the species poverty especially of the Lowland forest Flora may be the result of the spread of C 4 grasslands and associated regular fires.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:20:55","2019-06-28T13:20:55Z","","1–14","","38","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Cenozoic; biogeography; diversification rates; extinction; fire; floras; savanna",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These changes are associated with deforestation, biodiversity loss and land degradation. A synthesis of results of long term research by an interdisciplinary team reveals the linkages between land use change, biodiversity loss and land degradation. The results indicate that as native vegetation is lost, indigenous plant and animal biodiversity and plant cover are lost. Pastoralism maintains native plant and animal species more effectively than crop cultivation. As croplands expand, soil fertility and moisture drops and soils erode more easily. Farmers who grow many crops conserve native plant species better than those who grow only one crop. Increased crop diversity encourages regeneration of indigenous plant species. Moderate farming as in the less intensive low input rainfed mixed crop farming, in less forested areas increases tree cover thus increasing the biodiversity. Farmers' who combine livestock rearing with cropping, use livestock manure to replenish soil nutrients in their farms and are thus able to maintain higher productivity. Farming in grasslands, woodlands and bushland areas where there are fewer trees, increases the diversity of habitats due to introduction of agrosystems that attract new species of birds. However, if the farming is intensified and the diversity of habitats is reduced biodiversity is also reduced. This paper presents findings of the investigations on these linkages in a diverse farming and herding systems ranging from lowlands to high mountains land uses.",2009,"2019-06-28 13:20:47","2019-06-28T13:20:47Z","","310–325","","10","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"biodiversity; east africa; land cover change; land degradation; land use change",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Accordingly, governments have agreed on improving and sharing biodiversity knowledge by 2020 (United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi target 19). To achieve this target, gaps in DAI must be identified, and actions prioritized to address their root causes. We take terrestrial vertebrates, an iconic and comparatively well-studied group, as a model and present the first globally comprehensive assessment of patterns and drivers of gaps in DAI, based on an integration of 157 million validated point records with 21,170 expert-based distribution maps. We demonstrate that outside a few well-sampled regions, DAI provides a very limited and spatially highly biased inventory of actual biodiversity. Coarser spatial grains result in more complete inventories, but provide insufficient detail for conservation and resource management. Surprisingly, large emerging economies are particularly under-represented in global DAI, even more so than species-rich, developing countries in the tropics. Multi-model inference reveals that completeness is mainly limited by distance to researchers, locally available research funding, and political participation in data-sharing networks, rather than transportation infrastructure, or size and funding of Western data contributors as often assumed. Our study provides an empirical baseline to advance strategies of enhancing the global information basis of biodiversity. In particular, our results highlight the need for targeted data integration from non-Western data holders and intensified cooperation to more effectively address societal biodiversity information needs.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:20:46","2019-06-28T13:20:46Z","","1–20","","5000","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24949238",NA,NA,NA,"Aichi targets; Species distributions; Used in AfRA Ch1; Wallacean shortfall; biodiversity data mobilization; geographical bias; knowledge gaps",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there are only a few studies of land degradation in Ethiopia which provide an integrated assessment of the driving forces and consequences. A pilot study was made in Adwa district (Tigray) with the objective of evaluating the factors related to environmental degradation and assessing the effects of agricultural activities on the natural resources. Environmental data, a digital terrain model, vegetation, geomorphological, and erosion maps of the study area were integrated with socio-economic variables using a geographical information system (GIS). The classification of the data used in the integration, and the information extracted using the GIS gave three main groups of Tabias and four main groups of variables. The relationship among the Tabias (smallest administrative units), groups of Tabias and environmental variables were quantified using various statistical, multivariate numerical methods and fuzzy set analysis. The application of fuzzy set theory showed that each group of Tabia, recognized as a rural subsystem (RS) was associated with a group of variables. Analysis of variance showed that the three RSs were significantly different in most of the environmental variables considered. Human and livestock population densities, geomorphology, altitude and some natural and anthropogenic vegetation types were highly discriminatory. Percentage cover of evergreen scrub, bushlands and severe badlands are considered key indicators of the scale of environmental degradation. Results of the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that human pressure had more impact on the physiognomy of the vegetation than on its floristic composition. The Evergreen scrub vegetation type appeared to be expanding with increasing human influence signifying a decrease in biomass of vegetation as a result of collecting wood for fuel and other domestic uses. Bushland appeared to be expanding with the same trend. Woodland, which was abundant in one of the RSs, is considered to be the natural physiognomic vegetation type in the area and efforts to maintain it and/or recover it elsewhere in the study area are recommended. Food production in the area did not match population growth. The expected crop yield under good soil and rainfall conditions was low by any standard. The per capita energy obtained from the grain harvested in the farm plots ranged from 428 to 4347 cal per person per day (the average is far below the basic minimum required for mere subsistence) suggesting that there is a need for substantial supplementary income from off-farm activities and/or other sources. This study indicated that regional and site specific approaches and interaction with the people at all stages of the research, program development and implementation are required for sustainable rehabilitation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using multi-source satellite imagery combined with geographical and demographic data, this study's aims were to analyse the extent of land cover changes (LCC) and identifying major landscape transformation processes (LTP) and their drivers for four West African cities in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Nigeria and Niger. A common classification scheme was used for a visual interpretation of Corona images from the 1960s and an automated classification of Landsat scenes from 1986, 2000/2001 and 2009. Based on a postclassification comparison LCC were summarized and related to the demographic trends of the past 50 years. Map changes were calculated from 1986 to 2009 to depict LTP (urbanisation, crop expansion, deforestation, and land abandonment) for the cities and their respective hinterlands. To investigate the effect of accessibility and infrastructural factors, LTP were related to the distance to roads, surface water and urban areas. From 1960 to 2009 a large-scale urban agglomeration was detected and the proportion of cultivated land in former natural woody savannas surrounding all four cities increased by 35%. The expansion of cropland during the past 30 years seemed to depend greatly on the availability of irrigation water in the semi-arid Sahelian cities (Kano and Niamey), whilst this was not a major driving factor for the cities of the Sudanian zone (Sikasso and Bobo-Dioulasso). Given the likely increase in water scarcity and land suitable for agriculture, ex ante land use planning and monitoring strategies will become increasingly important. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:20:42","2019-06-28T13:20:42Z","","94–105","","1-2","105",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Corona; Landsat; Satellite image classification; Urban and peri-urban agriculture; Urbanisation; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
