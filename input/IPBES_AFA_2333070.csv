This concept has proved useful and is now often used in conservation ecology. Here, we introduce the concept of keystone communities (and ecosystems) within metacommunities (and metaecosystems). We define keystone and burden communities as communities with impacts disproportionately large (positive or negative respectively) relative to their weight in the metacommunity. We show how a simple metric, based on the effects of single-community removals, can characterise communities along a 'keystoneness' axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with examples from two different theoretical models. We further distinguish environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants of keystoneness. We suggest that the concept of keystone communities/ecosystems will be highly beneficial, not only as a fundamental step towards understanding species interactions in a spatial context, but also as a tool for the management of disturbed landscapes.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:22:10","2019-06-28T13:22:10Z","","1–8","","1","16",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23062191",NA,NA,NA,"Burden; Dispersal; Habitat destruction; Keystone; Metacommunity; Metaecosystem; Patch dynamics; Source-sink; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. Methods We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years; DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. Findings In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7 0% [95% uncertainty interval 6 2-7 7] of global DALYs); tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 3% [5 5-7 0]), and alcohol use (5 5% [5 0-5 9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7 9% [6 8-9 4]), household air pollution from solid fuels; (HAP; 7 0% [5 6-8 3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 1% [5 4-6 8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10 0% (95% UI 9 2-10 8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water ' and sanitation accounting for 0 9% (0 4-1 6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. Interpretation Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:22:07","2019-06-28T13:22:07Z","","2224–2260","","9859","380",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23245609",NA,NA,NA,"Disease burden; Global scale; Poverty; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Convention on Biological Diversity and other international and national policy agreements have set broad goals for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss. However, efforts to conserve biodiversity cannot be effective without comprehensive metrics both to assess progress towards meeting conservation goals and to account for measures that reduce pressures so that positive actions are encouraged. We developed an index based on a global assessment of the condition of marine biodiversity using publically available data to estimate the condition of species and habitats within 151 coastal countries. Our assessment also included data on social and ecological pressures on biodiversity as well as variables that indicate whether good governance is in place to reduce them. Thus, our index is a social as well as ecological measure of the current and likely future status of biodiversity. As part of our analyses, we set explicit reference points or targets that provide benchmarks for success and allow for comparative assessment of current conditions. Overall country-level scores ranged from 43 to 95 on a scale of 1 to 100, but countries that scored high for species did not necessarily score high for habitats. Although most current status scores were relatively high, likely future status scores for biodiversity were much lower in most countries due to negative trends for both species and habitats. We also found a strong positive relationship between the Human Development Index and resilience measures that could promote greater sustainability by reducing pressures. This relationship suggests that many developing countries lack effective governance, further jeopardizing their ability to maintain species and habitats in the future.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:22:05","2019-06-28T13:22:05Z","","","","4","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23593188",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity status; Human development index; Resilience; Used in AfRA CH1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The empirical analysis identifies substantial inter-country variations in the incidence of slums; and indicates that higher levels of income, greater financial stability and investment in infrastructure will reduce the incidence of slums and by extension— reduce social exclusion. Conversely, the external debt burden, high levels of inequality, unplanned and unmanaged urban growth, and the exclusionary nature of the regulatory framework governing the provision of planned residential land contribute to the prevalence of slums and squatter settlements— thus increasing levels of social exclusion.",2001,"2019-06-28 13:22:03","2019-06-28T13:22:03Z","","1–33","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Informal settlement; Slums; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is the case for the genus Prosopis (mesquite; Fabaceae) where several taxa are among the world's most damaging invasive species. Many contentious issues ('conflicts of interest') surround these taxa, and management interventions have not yet sustainably reduced the negative impacts. There is an urgent need to better understand the factors that drive invasions and shape management actions, and to compare the effectiveness of different management approaches. This paper presents a global review of Prosopis, focusing on its distribution, impacts, benefits and approaches to management. Prosopis was found to occur in a 129 countries globally and many more countries are climatically suitable. All areas with naturalized or invasive Prosopis species at present are suitable for more taxa and many Asian and Mediterranean countries with no records of Prosopis are bioclimatically suitable. Several Prosopis species have substantial impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and local and regional economies in their native and even more so in their invasive ranges; others provide multiple benefits to local communities. Management efforts are underway in only a small part of the invaded range. Countries where more research has been done are more likely to implement formal management than those where little published research is available. Management strategies differ among countries; developed nations use mainly mechanical and chemical control whereas developing nations tend to apply control through utilization approaches. A range of countries are also using biological control. Key gaps in knowledge and promising options for management are highlighted.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:22:00","2019-06-28T13:22:00Z","","1–18","","","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24899150",NA,NA,NA,"Classification and regression tree; Distribution; Global review; Impacts; Logistic regression; Management; Mesquite; Tree invasions; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet ecological understanding of ecosystem services is quite limited. Previous work maps the supply and demand for services, assesses threats to them, and estimates economic values, but does not measure the underlying role of biodiversity in providing services. In contrast, experimental studies of biodiversity-function examine communities whose structures often differ markedly from those providing services in real landscapes. A bridge is needed between these two approaches. To develop this research agenda, I discuss critical questions and key approaches in four areas: (1) identifying the important 'ecosystem service providers'; (2) determining the various aspects of community structure that influence function in real landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3) assessing key environmental factors influencing provision of services, and (4) measuring the spatio-temporal scale over which providers and services operate. I show how this research agenda can assist in developing environmental policy and natural resource management plans.",2005,"2019-06-28 13:21:53","2019-06-28T13:21:53Z","","468–479","","5","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21352450",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Community structure; Conservation planning; Diversity-function; Ecological economics; Ecosystem function; Functional structure; Natural resource management; Redundancy; Resilience; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recently, wideranging claims have been made to the effect that environmen- tal degradation will increase resource scarcity and therefore contribute to an increase in armed conflict. So far, there has been much controversy and little relevant systematic study of this phenomenon. Most scholarship on the relationship between resources, the environment, and armed conflict suffers from one or more of the following problems: (1) there is a lack of clarity over what is meant by 'environ- mental conflict'; (2) researchers engage in definitional and polemical exercises rather than analysis; (3) important variables are neglected, notably political and economic factors which have a strong influence on conflict and mediate the influence of resource and environmental factors; (4) some models become so large and complex that they are virtually untestable; (5) cases are selected on values of the dependent variable; (G) the causality of the relationship is reversed; (7) postulated events in the future are cited as empirical evidence; (8) studies fail to distinguish between foreign and domestic conflict; and (9) con- fusion reigns about the appropriate level of analysis.

Its pods can be used as livestock food and are fed upon by native herbivores. It has good timber and shade and quickly turns bare arid environments green. These qualities rendered it an attractive candidate for aridland environmental rehabilitation programmes. In the 80s and early 90s it was a preferred species in afforestation, fuel-energy and fodder programmes in Kenya's Turkana and Baringo districts and North Eastern Province. Prosopis however produces masses of pods containing small tough smooth seeds. When pods are eaten by livestock, seeds pass easily through the gut. Once in the soil, seeds can lie dormant for long, till good conditions return. Prosopis is deep-rooted and coppices well when cut above ground. These factors make it highly invasive and hard to control once established. Research was carried out to determine the spread of Prosopis juliflora over time in Kenya and its effect on livelihoods and biodiversity. It was evident that barely three decades since the first herbarium specimen was collected in 1977 from Coast Province, the species was now found in seven of Kenya's eight provinces. It was more aggressive in aridlands of the north where it formed thorny impenetrable thickets especially along water courses, flood plains, roadsides and in inhabited areas. It was encroaching upon paths, dwellings, irrigation schemes, crop farms and pastureland, significantly affecting biological diversity and rural livelihoods. Three sites, Baringo in the Rift Valley, Garissa between Coast and North Eastern Provinces and Loiyangalani in Eastern Province were chosen for detailed studies covering economic importance, perceptions, effect on biodiversity and what it would take to manage the spread of prosopis. Of the 18 positive attributes mentioned, charcoal making and fodder were most important. 24 negative attributes were mentioned. Of these, invasion of pastureland, cropland and homesteads was ranked first followed by the harmful effects of the thorns. The significance of each attribute however varied across and within the sites. In all three sites, there was significantly more plant diversity outside prosopis thicket than within it. The average labour cost of clearing a prosopis thicket 3-4 yrs old in a plot 10x10 m was found to range from Ksh 1000 (US$ 13) in Loiyangalani and Ksh 1200 in Baringo to Ksh 2,800 in Garissa. It was evident that in areas where prosopis was well established, it was beyond the community's ability to control its expansion. Prosopis invasion had reduced the capacity of pastoralists to keep large herds of livestock in affected areas. The impact among pastoralist communities has led to frequent lawsuits, pitting communities in Baringo District against government. Their source of livelihood undermined, they had turned to the very prosopis as a source of income, mainly poles, charcoal and pods. On perception, an overwhelming majority in all sites (64% in Garissa, 78.6% in Loiyangalani and 67% in Baringo) said life would be better without prosopis. Despite the stand of the affected local communities, the environmentalists, scientists and development workers were still divided on prosopis matters. Future scenarios indicated further expansion that will not only affect people's livelihoods but also key sectors of the economy such as tourism. It is evident that Kenya's vast arid and semi-arid lands totalling 80% of land area are at risk and the longer the wait, the more difficult it will be to control or eradicate the species. A comprehensive policy on prosopis is proposed.",2009,"2019-06-28 13:21:49","2019-06-28T13:21:49Z","","33–50","","2-3","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Arid ecosystem; Invasive alien species; Local livelihoods; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: The framework integrates three interrelated characteristics of environment-disease relationships: a) Environmental change manifests in a complex web of ecologic and social factors that may ultimately impact disease; these factors are represented as those more distally related and those more proximally related to disease. b) Transmission dynamics of infectious pathogens mediate the effects that environmental changes have on disease. c) Disease burden is the outcome of the interplay between environmental change and the transmission cycle of a pathogen. RESULTS: To put this framework into operation, we present a matrix formulation as a means to define important elements of this system and to summarize what is known and unknown about the these elements and their relationships. The framework explicitly expresses the problem at a systems level that goes beyond the traditional risk factor analysis used in public health, and the matrix provides a means to explicitly express the coupling of different system components. CONCLUSION: This coupling of environmental and disease transmission processes provides a much-needed construct for furthering our understanding of both specific and general relationships between environmental change and infectious disease.",2007,"2019-06-28 13:21:47","2019-06-28T13:21:47Z","","1216–1223","","8","115",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17687450",NA,NA,NA,"Environmental change; Infectious disease; Interdisciplinary; System theory; Transmission dynamics; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the majority of countries have adopted the view that global warming must be limited to \textless2 °C, current GHG emission rates and nonagreement at Copenhagen in December2009 increase the likelihood of this limit being exceeded by 2100. Extensive evi- dence has linked major changes in biological systems to 20th cen- tury warming. The “Global 200” comprises 238 ecoregions of exceptional biodiversity [Olson DM, Dinerstein E (2002) Ann Mo Bot Gard 89:199–224].Weassess the likelihood that, by 2070, these iconic ecoregions will regularly experience monthly climatic condi- tions that were extreme in 1961–1990. Using \textgreater600 realizations from climate model ensembles, we show that up to 86% of terres- trial and 83% of freshwater ecoregions will be exposed to average monthly temperature patterns \textgreater2 SDs (2σ) of the 1961–1990 base- line, including 82% of critically endangered ecoregions. The entire range of 89 ecoregions will experience extreme monthly temper- atures with a local warming of\textless2 °C. Tropical and subtropical ecor- egions, and mangroves, face extreme conditions earliest, some with \textless1 °C warming. In contrast, few ecoregions within Boreal Forests and Tundra biomes will experience such extremes this cen- tury. On average, precipitation regimes do not exceed 2σ of the baseline period, although considerable variability exists across the climate realizations. Further, the strength of the correlation between seasonal temperature and precipitation changes over nu- merous ecoregions. These results suggest many Global 200 ecore- gions may be under substantial climatic stress by 2100. climate",2011,"2019-06-28 13:21:44","2019-06-28T13:21:44Z","","2306–2311","","6","108",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 21262825",NA,NA,NA,"Used in AfRA Ch1; climate impacts; climate model ensemble; conservation B",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The report concludes that even if an international ABS regime has been in place for more than 20 years, implementation at the national level has been slow both in terms of enacting access legislation and legislation to support compliance with access legislation. A fairly large amount of bioprospecting activities have been generated but - apparently - few with a commercial intent and thus with few examples and low amounts of monetary benefits. Research on ABS has mainly been theoretical and less research has been conducted on ABS in practice. Main research gaps are: 1) Actual and potential contribution of ABS to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity; 2) ABS, equity and standard setting; 3) ABS beyond genetic resources; 4) Business approaches to ABS; 5) Mapping the value chain of genetic/biological material from its collection to an end product.

Infrastructure development is at the top of the nine-point agenda. A G20-mandated High Level Panel (HLP) on Infrastructure, working in close cooperation with Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), submitted its report and final recommendations to the French G20 Summit in November 2011. In order to close Africa's energy infrastructure gap, the panel emphasises large-scale public-private partnership (PPP) projects in order to promote economic growth and regional integration. The panel asserts that new investments into the continent's energy sector are long overdue. This is true. However, this article takes issue with the HLP's call for delivering solutions with an entire focus on large-scale, centralised energy infrastructure projects. The recommendations don't sufficiently interrogate the feasibility and potential impacts; more attention should be given to modular and more flexibly deployable renewable energy technologies that can reduce poverty and minimise financial risk while maintaining a small carbon footprint.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:21:42","2019-06-28T13:21:42Z","","1–13","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Cape town",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Energy; Infrastructure development; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"June","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such dynamism involves constantly changing advantages and disadvantages to different groups of people, which not surprisingly can lead to armed conflict, and all too frequently to war. Many governments have contributed to conflict, however inadvertently, by nationalizing their forests, so that traditional forest inhabitants have been disenfranchised while national governments sell the rights to trees in order to earn foreign exchange. Biodiversity-rich tropical forests in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Indochina, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Central and West Africa, the Amazon, Colombia, Central America and New Caledonia have all been the sites of armed conflict in recent years, sometimes involving international forces. Forests have sometimes been part of the cause of conflict (as in Myanmar and Sierra Leone) but more often victims of it. Violent conflicts in temperate areas also typically involve forests as shelters for both civilians and combatants, as in the Balkans. While these conflicts have frequently, even invariably, caused negative impacts on biodiversity, peace can be even worse, as it enables forest exploitation to operate with impunity. Because many of the remaining forests are along international borders, international cooperation is required for their conservation. As one response, the concept of international ""Peace Parks"" is being promoted in many parts of the world as a way of linking biodiversity conservation with national security.

One of the main issues surrounding the provision of such data is that sources vary in quality, scope, and accuracy. Publishers of such data must face the challenge of maximizing quality, utility and breadth of data coverage, in order to make such data useful to users. With the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we recently conducted a content needs assessment survey to consolidate and synthesize major user needs regarding biodiversity data. We find a broad range of recommendations from the survey respondents, principally concerning issues such as data quality, bias, and coverage, and ease of access. We recommend a candidate set of actions for the GBIF that fall into three classes: 1) addressing data gaps, data volume, and data quality, 2) aggregating data types that are relatively new to GBIF, to support emerging new applications, and 3) promoting ease-of-use and providing incentives for wider use. Addressing the challenge of providing high quality primary biodiversity data potentially can serve the needs of national and international biodiversity initiatives. These include the “flexible framework” for addressing the new 2020 biodiversity targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the global biodiversity observation network (GEO BON) and the new Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

Deviation from the norm may serve as a proxy assessment of land degradation and improvement – if other factors that may be responsible are taken into account. These other factors include rainfall effects which may be assessed by rain-use efficiency, calculated from NDVI and rainfall. Results from the analysis of the 23-year Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI data indicate declining rain-use efficiency-adjusted NDVI on ca. 24% of the global land area with degrading areas mainly in Africa south of the equator, South-East Asia and south China, north-central Australia, the Pampas and swaths of the Siberian and north American taiga; 1.5 billion people live in these areas.

This could be achieved with ecological indicators, if they can be easily and routinely measured and are representative of the complexity of the restored ecosystems. We used peatlands restored after horticultural peat extraction in eastern Canada to test a methodological approach that predicts restoration success early after restoration implementation. The goal of restoration of these extracted peatlands is to re-establish a moss carpet typically dominated by Sphagnum mosses, the main peat-accumulating plant group in these northern ecosystems. Vegetation in a total of 152 plots in 41 peatlands restored after peat extraction activities and distributed across a span of 600 km was monitored every 2 years since the third year after restoration. The plots were clustered in three restoration outcome categories: Sphagnum-dominated, bare peat-dominated and Polytrichum-dominated, according to their characteristic vegetation composition at the time of the latest survey for each plot (4-11 years since restoration). Second, vegetation composition in the same plots from the earliest survey, 3 years since restoration, and key environmental and management variables such as summer temperature, effectiveness of ditch blockage, season of restoration works and delay in P fertilization were analyzed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to obtain the combination of parameters that best discriminated between the restoration outcome categories. LDA correctly classified 71% of the plots of a calibration database (for which 75% of the sectors were used) and 75% of a validation database (for which 25% of the sectors were used) into the three categories. The obtained LDA models can be used to allocate new plots to one of the restoration outcome categories by providing a series of linear equations (classification functions) that are computed from the combination of ecological indicators. One additional and recently restored peatland was used to illustrate application of these equations of the LDA model to predict future restoration outcome and subsequently adapt management strategies. Such a LDA model provides an unequivocal (i.e., one new plot assigned to one and only one restoration outcome category) prediction of success based on multiple but simple, easily recognizable indicators and spares managers the complex task of interpreting many individual predictors for establishing a clear diagnosis. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:21:21","2019-06-28T13:21:21Z","","156–166","","","46",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Indicator value (IndVal); Ombrotrophic peatlands; Peat extraction; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It also explores how the taxonomic endeavour could benefit from studies of invasive species. We review the literature on the current situation in taxonomy with a focus on the challenges of identifying alien plant species and explore how this has affected the study of biological invasions. Biosecurity strategies, legislation dealing with invasive species, quarantine, weed surveillance and monitoring all depend on accurate and rapid identification of non-native taxa. However, such identification can be challenging because the taxonomic skill base in most countries is diffuse and lacks critical mass. Taxonomic resources are essential for the effective management of invasive plants and incorrect identifications can impede ecological studies. On the other hand, biological invasions have provided important tests of basic theories about species concepts. Better integration of classical alpha taxonomy and modern genetic taxonomic approaches will improve the accuracy of species identification and further refine taxonomic classification at the level of populations and genotypes in the field and laboratory. Modern taxonomy therefore needs to integrate both classical and new concepts and approaches. In particular, differing points of view between the proponents of morphological and molecular approaches should be negotiated because a narrow taxonomic perspective is harmful; the rigour of taxonomic decision-making clearly increases if insights from a variety of different complementary disciplines are combined and confronted. Taxonomy plays a critical role in the study of plant invasions and in turn benefits from the insights gained from these studies.",2013,"2019-06-28 13:21:20","2019-06-28T13:21:20Z","","1–25","","","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biological invasions; DNA barcoding; Detecting new invasions; Invasive plants; Karyology; Management; Species identification; Taxonomy; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Population data and satellite images for two time periods a decade apart were obtained and analyzed, and several measures of urban extent and expansion among them the built-up area of cities and the average density of the built-up area were calculated. Data for 90 cities out of the global sample of 120 is presented and analyzed in this report. Weighted averages of the built-up area and the average density, as well as compactness and contiguity measures and their change over time are presented for nine regions, four income groups and four city size groups covering the entire globe. Densities in developing-country cities were found to be some three times higher than densities in cities in industrialized countries, and densities in all regions were found to be decreasing over time. If average densities continue to decline at the annual rate of 1.7% as they have during the past decadethe built-up area of developing-country cities will increase from 200,000 km2 in 2000 to more than 600,000 km2 by 2030, while their population doubles. Ten econometric models that sought to explain the variation in urban extent and expansion in the universe of cities were constructed, and several hypotheses postulated by neoclassical theories of urban spatial structure were tested. All tests yielded R2 values in excess of 0.80. The policy implications of the analysis are presented and discussed. The Central message of this study is quite clear: Developing country cities should be making realistic yet minimal plans for urban expansion, designating adequate areas for accommodating the projected expansion, investing wisely in basic trunk infrastructure to serve this expansion, and protecting sensitive land from incursion by new urban development.",2005,"2019-06-28 13:21:11","2019-06-28T13:21:11Z","","1–207","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The World Bank Disclaimer:","Washington D.C",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1038/nature09440 PMID: 16286400",NA,NA,NA,"Gloabl Urban Growth; Urban density; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The AMCEN Bureau requested then its Secretariat to facilitate the preparation of a guidebook - Addressing Climate Change Challenges in Africa: A Practical Guide towards Sustainable Development. The Guidebook aims to translate available climate science analysis and current international climate policies into practical implementation in Africa in the context of sustainable development. In this regard the guidebook focuses on analysis of potential climate change impacts in key sectors in Africa and appropriate adaptation and mitigation options. It informs on matters related to governance, technological, financial and capacity building needs and opportunities on the continent with relevance to sustainable development. It provides information that has been synthesized and integrated from relevant IPCC and UN reports and other documentation on emerging issues on environment, climate change and development. It provides guidance and practical advice on how to address climate change issues in the development and implementation of actions leading to sustainable development. The Guidebook is self-contained and stands alone, but provides guidance to intended users to other relevant materials in the form of links and annexes.",2011,"2019-06-28 13:21:06","2019-06-28T13:21:06Z","","272","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Addis Ababa",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.4314/wsa.v37i5.2",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Sustainable development; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In view of this we will strive to achieve a land-degradation neutral world...."" This paragraph sets a goal of maintaining a world where the total amount of degraded land remains constant, and that would secure the currently available productive land for the use of present and future generations.This article examines the challenges of operationalizing this concept of Zero Net Land Degradation (ZNLD) and its global derivative, a land degradation neutral world (LDNW).First, the concept and need for ZNLD is introduced and explained. Then we look at the expectations from ZNLD/LDNW targets within the context of promoting the recognition of land degradation as a global threat and contributing to global food security. Next we elaborate the challenges in making ZNLD operational, including: scoping (determining the spatial scale and the selected domain for which land degradation neutrality is to be achieved); mapping (classifying the lands by their current use and state of their productivity); prescribing (prescribing management practices relevant to each of the land classes); applying the selected land management (for either reducing degradation, restoring productivity, or increasing resilience); and monitoring management and its outcome.We then examine the enabling environment necessary to capture ZNLD opportunities and address the technical challenges facing the operationalization of ZNLD. The article concludes with recommendations for the way forward: first, recognize existing projects suitable for ZNLD testing and establish new pilot projects at the local community or landscape scales; and the second, seek recognition and support for achieving ZNLD at the global scale through the United Nations system.",2015,"2019-06-28 13:21:03","2019-06-28T13:21:03Z","","5–13","","PA","112",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Desertification; Land degradation; Restoration; Sustainable development goals; UNCCD; Used in AfRA Ch1; Zero Net Land Degradation",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The spatial patterns of this diversity have been well explored. We can group the species into a set of biogeographical regions (largely co-incident with regions defined for terrestrial vertebrate groups). Furthermore, we know that the diversity is unevenly distributed, with southern Africa (especially the south-western tip) disproportionally species rich, while the West African interior is disproportionally species poor. However, the origins of this diversity have only been explored for two anomalous African Floras (the Tropic-alpine Flora and the Cape Flora), whereas the origins of the diversity of the other floras are still unknown. Here I argue that six floras, with distinct geographical centers, different extra-African affinities, ages of radiation and radiation rates, can be delimited: the Austro-temperate, Tropic-alpine, Lowland forest, Tropic-montane, Savanna and Arid Floras. The oldest flora may be the Lowland forest Flora, and the most recent is the Tropic-alpine, which probably evolved during the Plio-Pleistocene on the summits of the East Africa volcanoes. My results suggest that the most rapidly radiating flora is the Austro-temperate Flora, while the other floras are all diversifying at more or less the same rate, this is also consistent with the current massive species richness in this flora (about half of the African species richness). The Austro-temperate Flora appears to be related to the floras of the other southern continents, the Tropic-alpine Flora to that of the Northern Hemisphere, and the four tropical floras to the tropical regions of the other continents, consistent with the theory of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Current African diversity may be the result of the sequential adding of new floras to the continent.

These changes are associated with deforestation, biodiversity loss and land degradation. A synthesis of results of long term research by an interdisciplinary team reveals the linkages between land use change, biodiversity loss and land degradation. The results indicate that as native vegetation is lost, indigenous plant and animal biodiversity and plant cover are lost. Pastoralism maintains native plant and animal species more effectively than crop cultivation. As croplands expand, soil fertility and moisture drops and soils erode more easily. Farmers who grow many crops conserve native plant species better than those who grow only one crop. Increased crop diversity encourages regeneration of indigenous plant species. Moderate farming as in the less intensive low input rainfed mixed crop farming, in less forested areas increases tree cover thus increasing the biodiversity. Farmers' who combine livestock rearing with cropping, use livestock manure to replenish soil nutrients in their farms and are thus able to maintain higher productivity. Farming in grasslands, woodlands and bushland areas where there are fewer trees, increases the diversity of habitats due to introduction of agrosystems that attract new species of birds. However, if the farming is intensified and the diversity of habitats is reduced biodiversity is also reduced. This paper presents findings of the investigations on these linkages in a diverse farming and herding systems ranging from lowlands to high mountains land uses.",2009,"2019-06-28 13:20:47","2019-06-28T13:20:47Z","","310–325","","10","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"biodiversity; east africa; land cover change; land degradation; land use change",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Accordingly, governments have agreed on improving and sharing biodiversity knowledge by 2020 (United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi target 19). To achieve this target, gaps in DAI must be identified, and actions prioritized to address their root causes. We take terrestrial vertebrates, an iconic and comparatively well-studied group, as a model and present the first globally comprehensive assessment of patterns and drivers of gaps in DAI, based on an integration of 157 million validated point records with 21,170 expert-based distribution maps. We demonstrate that outside a few well-sampled regions, DAI provides a very limited and spatially highly biased inventory of actual biodiversity. Coarser spatial grains result in more complete inventories, but provide insufficient detail for conservation and resource management. Surprisingly, large emerging economies are particularly under-represented in global DAI, even more so than species-rich, developing countries in the tropics. Multi-model inference reveals that completeness is mainly limited by distance to researchers, locally available research funding, and political participation in data-sharing networks, rather than transportation infrastructure, or size and funding of Western data contributors as often assumed. Our study provides an empirical baseline to advance strategies of enhancing the global information basis of biodiversity. In particular, our results highlight the need for targeted data integration from non-Western data holders and intensified cooperation to more effectively address societal biodiversity information needs.",2014,"2019-06-28 13:20:46","2019-06-28T13:20:46Z","","1–20","","5000","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 24949238",NA,NA,NA,"Aichi targets; Species distributions; Used in AfRA Ch1; Wallacean shortfall; biodiversity data mobilization; geographical bias; knowledge gaps",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there are only a few studies of land degradation in Ethiopia which provide an integrated assessment of the driving forces and consequences. A pilot study was made in Adwa district (Tigray) with the objective of evaluating the factors related to environmental degradation and assessing the effects of agricultural activities on the natural resources. Environmental data, a digital terrain model, vegetation, geomorphological, and erosion maps of the study area were integrated with socio-economic variables using a geographical information system (GIS). The classification of the data used in the integration, and the information extracted using the GIS gave three main groups of Tabias and four main groups of variables. The relationship among the Tabias (smallest administrative units), groups of Tabias and environmental variables were quantified using various statistical, multivariate numerical methods and fuzzy set analysis. The application of fuzzy set theory showed that each group of Tabia, recognized as a rural subsystem (RS) was associated with a group of variables. Analysis of variance showed that the three RSs were significantly different in most of the environmental variables considered. Human and livestock population densities, geomorphology, altitude and some natural and anthropogenic vegetation types were highly discriminatory. Percentage cover of evergreen scrub, bushlands and severe badlands are considered key indicators of the scale of environmental degradation. Results of the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that human pressure had more impact on the physiognomy of the vegetation than on its floristic composition. The Evergreen scrub vegetation type appeared to be expanding with increasing human influence signifying a decrease in biomass of vegetation as a result of collecting wood for fuel and other domestic uses. Bushland appeared to be expanding with the same trend. Woodland, which was abundant in one of the RSs, is considered to be the natural physiognomic vegetation type in the area and efforts to maintain it and/or recover it elsewhere in the study area are recommended. Food production in the area did not match population growth. The expected crop yield under good soil and rainfall conditions was low by any standard. The per capita energy obtained from the grain harvested in the farm plots ranged from 428 to 4347 cal per person per day (the average is far below the basic minimum required for mere subsistence) suggesting that there is a need for substantial supplementary income from off-farm activities and/or other sources. This study indicated that regional and site specific approaches and interaction with the people at all stages of the research, program development and implementation are required for sustainable rehabilitation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using multi-source satellite imagery combined with geographical and demographic data, this study's aims were to analyse the extent of land cover changes (LCC) and identifying major landscape transformation processes (LTP) and their drivers for four West African cities in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Nigeria and Niger. A common classification scheme was used for a visual interpretation of Corona images from the 1960s and an automated classification of Landsat scenes from 1986, 2000/2001 and 2009. Based on a postclassification comparison LCC were summarized and related to the demographic trends of the past 50 years. Map changes were calculated from 1986 to 2009 to depict LTP (urbanisation, crop expansion, deforestation, and land abandonment) for the cities and their respective hinterlands. To investigate the effect of accessibility and infrastructural factors, LTP were related to the distance to roads, surface water and urban areas. From 1960 to 2009 a large-scale urban agglomeration was detected and the proportion of cultivated land in former natural woody savannas surrounding all four cities increased by 35%. The expansion of cropland during the past 30 years seemed to depend greatly on the availability of irrigation water in the semi-arid Sahelian cities (Kano and Niamey), whilst this was not a major driving factor for the cities of the Sudanian zone (Sikasso and Bobo-Dioulasso). Given the likely increase in water scarcity and land suitable for agriculture, ex ante land use planning and monitoring strategies will become increasingly important. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2012,"2019-06-28 13:20:42","2019-06-28T13:20:42Z","","94–105","","1-2","105",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Corona; Landsat; Satellite image classification; Urban and peri-urban agriculture; Urbanisation; Used in AfRA Ch1",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
