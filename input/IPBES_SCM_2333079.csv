Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature, rainfall) and in the distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable, standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management decisions can all be monitored. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting new research and technological developments that have a high potential to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations. © 2014 British Ecological Society.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:51","2022-10-11T14:41:51Z",NA,"839–848","","4",51,NA,NA,"Satellite remote sensing for applied ecologists",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Earth observations; Environmental management; Natural capital; Sensor; Technology; Wildlife management","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A critical step in that challenge is to understand how changing environmental conditions influence processes across levels of ecological organization. While direct scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics can lead to robust and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level. Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling through community processes, but predicting how such changes may influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions using a trait-based response-effect framework that differentiates the community response to environmental change (predicted by response traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species' response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental change on function. We then detail several key research directions needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the community level. These include (1) effect and response trait characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3) the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4) incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities worldwide make such a research agenda imperative. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:41:51","2022-10-11T14:41:51Z",NA,"1125–1140","","5",14,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Community dynamics; Diversity; Ecosystem responses; Effect and response framework; Functional traits; Global change; Leaf-level scaling; Physiology","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In doing so, we draw from multiple cases, multiple disciplines, and multiple perspectives. In this synthesis paper, and in the accompanying cases, we hypothesize that the dynamics of cross-scale and cross-level interactions are affected by the interplay between institutions at multiple levels and scales.

Lynch and colleagues' call for daily satellite observations of forests worldwide would mean aggregating information from numerous satellites that are operated by many countries. Assembling the large data sets needed for global monitoring would be prohibitively expensive, however, because national governments do not have a free-access policy for their satellite images. One solution would be to combine data from the US Landsat satellites with those from the European Space Agency's planned Sentinel-2 satellites, which could deliver optical imagery with global coverage every 3–5 days. The distribution of Landsat imagery has increased by two orders of magnitude since 2008, when the US Geological Survey made all the data free to access online.

When the world is highly unpredictable and we are working from a limited range of expectations, however, our expectations will frequently be proved wrong. Scenario planning offers a framework for developing more resilient conservation policies when faced with uncontrollable, irreducible uncertainty. A scenario in this context is an account of a plausible future. Scenario planning consists of using a few contrasting scenarios to explore the uncertainty surrounding the future consequences of a decision. Ideally, scenarios should be constructed by a diverse group of people for a single, stated purpose. Scenario planning can incorporate a variety of quantitative and qualitative information in the decision-making process. Often, consideration of this diverse information in a systemic way leads to better decisions. Furthermore, the participation of a diverse group of people in a systemic process of collecting, discussing, and analyzing scenarios builds shared understanding. The robustness provided by the consideration of multiple possible futures has served several groups well; we present examples from business, government, and conservation planning that illustrate the value of scenario planning. For conservation, major benefits of using scenario planning are (1) increased understanding of key uncertainties, (2) incorporation of alternative perspectives into conservation planning, and (3) greater resilience of decisions to surprise.",2003,"2022-10-11 14:41:50","2022-10-11T14:41:50Z",NA,"358–366","","2",17,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study illustrates an upscaling approach to studying the spatiotemporal pattern of ecosystem processes in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in northeastern China by integrating simulation modeling, GIS, remote sensing data, and field-based observations. The ecosystem model incorporated processes of energy transfer, plant physiology, carbon dynamics, and water cycling. Using a direct extrapolation scheme, the patch-level ecosystem model was scaled up to quantify the landscape-level pattern of primary productivity and the carbon source-sink relationship. The simulated net primary productivity (NPP) for the entire landscape, consisting of several ecosystem types, was 0.680 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). The most widely distributed ecosystem type in this region was the mixed broad-leaved and Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest, which had the highest NPP (1.084 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). The total annual NPP for all ecosystem types combined was estimated to be 1.332 Mt C yr(-1). These results suggest that the Changbai Mountain landscape as a whole was a carbon sink, with a net carbon sequestration rate of about 0.884 Mt C yr(-1) for the study period. The simulated NPP agreed reasonably well with available field measurements at a number of locations within the study landscape. Our study provides new insight into the relationship between landscape pattern and ecosystem processes, and useful information for improving management practices in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, which is one of the most important forested landscapes in China.

The ultimate aim of ALARM was to develop and test methods and protocols for the assessment of large-scale environmental risks to biodiversity and to evaluate mitigation options. Scenarios provide a tool for exploring such risks and the policy options to mitigate them; therefore they play a central role within the ALARM project. MethodsGÇé Three integrative scenarios (liberalization, business as might be usual, sustainability) were developed and illustrated using the econometric model described in a subsequent paper. They are contextualized with projections from climate models and provide the input for model-based assessments of biodiversity trends. Additionally, three shock scenarios were developed (Gulf Stream collapse, peak oil, pandemic) to demonstrate the limits of linear extrapolation. As these extend beyond model capabilities, they are discussed semi-quantitatively based on modelling insights. ResultsGÇé Although the policy impacts on biodiversity are different for different pressures, biomes and species groups, some general trends could be identified. An extension of current EU policies will act as a brake on current trends by slowing down the loss of biodiversity in many cases and in most biomes, but it will be capable of neither halting nor of reversing the loss. Liberalization has the effect of accelerating biodiversity loss across the board, with few exceptions. A coherent sustainability scenario is clearly the most effective at preserving biodiversity, but the variant tested here still does not halt losses in all cases. Main conclusionsGÇé Current EU policies for protecting biodiversity appear to be insufficient to reverse ongoing losses. Coherent sustainability strategies are effective at conserving biodiversity, but in order to assess losses and then reverse them, measures would need to be introduced that extend beyond the steps tested in the ALARM sustainability scenario",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:47","2022-10-11T14:41:47Z",NA,"5–18","","1",21,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Integration; Policy implications; Scenarios; Storylines; Uncertainty","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecological changes pose special challenges for long-term thinking, because of the possibility of regime shifts that occur rapidly yet alter the availability of ecosystem services for generations. Moreover, ecological feedbacks can intensify human modification of ecosystems, creating a spiral of poverty and ecosystem degradation. Such complex dynamics were evaluated by a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analyses in the MA scenarios. Collectively, the scenarios explore problems such as the connections of poverty reduction and ecosystem services, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. Several promising approaches are considered by the scenarios, including uses of biodiversity to build resilience of ecosystem services, actively adaptive management, and green technology. Although the scenarios do not prescribe an optimal path, they illuminate the consequences of different policies toward ecosystem services.

We forecasted the distribution of extant European large mammals (17 carnivores and 10 ungulates) based on 2 Rio+20 scenarios of socioeconomic development: business as usual and reduced impact through changes in human consumption of natural resources. These scenarios are linked to scenarios of land-use change and climate change through the spatial allocation of land conversion up to 2050. We used a hierarchical framework to forecast the extent and distribution of mammal habitat based on species' habitat preferences (as described in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List database) within a suitable climatic space fitted to the species' current geographic range. We analyzed the geographic and taxonomic variation of habitat loss for large mammals and the potential effect of the reduced impact policy on loss mitigation. Averaging across scenarios, European large mammals were predicted to lose 10% of their habitat by 2050 (25% in the worst-case scenario). Predicted loss was much higher for species in northwestern Europe, where habitat is expected to be lost due to climate and land-use change. Change in human consumption patterns was predicted to substantially improve the conservation of habitat for European large mammals, but not enough to reduce extinction risk if species cannot adapt locally to climate change or disperse. Escenarios de Perdida de Mamiferos Mayores en Europa para el Siglo XXI Las distribuciones y poblaciones de los mamiferos grandes estan declinando a nivel global, lo que conlleva un aumento en el riesgo de su extincion. Pronosticamos la distribucion de los mamiferos europeos existentes (17 carnivoros y 10 ungulados) con base en dos escenarios Rio+20 de desarrollo socio-economico: la normalidad y el impacto reducido a traves de los cambios en el consumo humano de los recursos naturales. Estos escenarios estan conectados a escenarios de cambio en el uso de suelo y cambio climatico por medio de la asignacion espacial de la conversion de suelo hasta el ano 2050. Usamos un marco de trabajo jerarquico para pronosticar la extension y la distribucion de los habitats de los mamiferos con base en las preferencias de habitat de las especies (como se describe en la base de datos de la Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de especies) dentro de un espacio climatico adecuado para acomodar a las especies en su extension geografica actual. Analizamos la variacion geografica y taxonomica de la perdida de habitat para los mamiferos mayores y el efecto potencial de la politica de impacto reducido sobre la mitigacion de perdidas. En los escenarios en promedio, se predijo que los mamiferos mayores de Europa perderian el 10% de su habitat para 2050 (25% el peor de los casos). La perdida pronosticada fue mucho mas alta para las especies en el noroeste de Europa, en donde se espera perder habitats debido al cambio climatico y de uso de suelo. Se pronostico que los cambios en los patrones de consumo humano mejorarian considerablemente la conservacion del habitat de los grandes mamiferos de Europa, pero no lo suficiente para reducir el riesgo de extincion si las especies no se pueden adaptar localmente al cambio climatico o a la dispersion.

Downscaled projections span a wide range of future potential conditions across sixteen land use/land cover sectors and 84 ecological regions, and are logically consistent with both historical measurements and SRES characteristics.

Models, integrating different system processes into a unified framework, are seen as useful tools to help analyse alternatives with stakeholders, assess their outcomes, and communicate results in a transparent way. This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:41:45","2022-10-11T14:41:45Z",NA,"159–181","","",47,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agent-based model; Bayesian network; Coupled component model; Integrated assessment; Knowledge-based model; System dynamics","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper presents an integrated approach to the construction of socio-economic scenarios required for the analysis of climate change impacts on European agricultural land use. The scenarios are interpreted from the storylines described in the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) special report on emission scenarios (SRES), which ensures internal consistency between the evolution of socio-economics and climate change. A stepwise downscaling procedure based on expert-judgement and pairwise comparison is presented to obtain quantitative socio-economic parameters, e.g. prices and productivity estimates that are input to the ACCELERATES integrated land use model. In the first step, the global driving forces are identified and quantified for each of the four SRES scenario families. In the second step, European agricultural driving forces are derived for each scenario from global driving forces. Finally, parameters for the agricultural land use model are quantified. The stepwise procedure is appropriate when developing socio-economic scenarios that are consistent with climate change scenarios used in climate impact studies. Furthermore, the pairwise comparison approach developed by Saaty [Saaty, T.L., 1980. The Analytic Hierarchy Process. McGraw Hill, New York] provides a useful tool for the quantification from narrative storylines of scenario drivers and model parameters. Descriptions of the narratives are, however, helpful at each step to facilitate the discussion and communication of the resulting scenarios. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in the snow budget have socioeconomic and environmental implications for agriculture, water-based industries, environment, land management, water supplies, and many others. To date, however, few scientific studies have been available to support a general perception of decline in seasonal snow cover in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region. ‘Snow-Cover Mapping and Monitoring in the Hindu Kush-Himalayas' is the first comprehensive status report of snow cover in the HKH region. It analyses information from ICIMOD's regional snow cover monitoring scheme, which is compiled in a database containing snow cover data for the whole region from 2000 to the present, updated weekly. The analysis is based on decadal (2000-2010) 8-day, 500 m spatial resolution snow images recorded by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The report analyses snow cover trends for the decade based on season, altitude, and region. It describes interannual and intra-annual trends for different parts of the region (west, central, and east) and the ten major river basins. As the data cover only one decade, they are not sufficient to yield statistically significant trends. However, there is an indication of an overall decrease in snow cover over the decade in the central HKH region and overall, and a slight increase in the western and eastern parts of the region. The report, and the database on which it is based, will help bridge the data and information gap on snow cover and support further research initiatives. Such information is also useful for planners and policy makers in formulating policies related to climate change and the downstream consequences for water resources.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:41:45","2022-10-11T14:41:45Z",NA,"","1–44","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"ICIMOD","Kathmandu","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But this volume should also be read by those who gain economic benefits from natural resources at a distance thanks to the sophisticated technology of communications and marketing systems. Most of these people are deeply indebted to the labour and creativity of rural communities, whose livelihoods are inextricably related to the natural resources and ecosystems in the different regions of the planet. Above all this volume is a tribute and recognition to the traditional knowledge, rights, skills and institutions of indigenous peoples and local communities and to their daily struggles for a balance between their immediate needs and long term well-being, founded on the sound and sustainable management of our planet‘s natural wealth. From a recollection of the political and socio-cultural history of human relationships with nature, the volume moves into a more conceptual analysis of actors, entitlements, equity and co-management itself. Through a series of illuminating examples characterised by cultural and regional diversity, the authors show us the impacts, tensions, inequalities and opportunities that inhabit the field of natural resource management and bear such important consequences for the livelihoods and quality of life of rural communities. Co-management as a process is then unpacked and explored in detail, from its roots in local systems of solidarity to the unlikely and very powerful “syncretic” merging of traditional practices and modern conservation expertise. As a matter of fact, when we are lucky enough to approach sound contemporary natural resource management, this looks more and more like a jigsaw puzzle of new and old knowledge, indigenous and modern elements, practices and values of different “cultural” origin. As in all processes of cultural change, we find in it contradictions and chaotic situations and, exactly because of this, the concept and practice of adaptive management become crucial. This should be appreciated in terms of both conceptual and practical relevance, as top-down inflexible and supposedly a-political decisions have indeed past their time. For practitioners in search of an open and flexible guide to co-management practice on the basis of lessons learned in a variety of socio-ecological settings, this volume simply has no equal. The “phases” of the process— organising, negotiating, implementing agreements and learning by doing— as well as the agreements and organisations they usually end up developing, are described and appreciated through a wealth of examples, tools and sound advice. The authors have obviously in mind the real world, where nothing is univocal and fixed and where complications abound as well as unexpected opportunities. The product is a creative tension between realities and visions, what is and what could be, especially in response to external forces and the continual demographic, social, economic and cultural changes that affect both local communities and other actors, and natural resources. If anything, one could fault the authors for being too positive, for compelling us to believe that, even in the worst possible situation, change is possible. But this may be more a consequence of the invigorating feeling that the reader carries away from the reading than of the content of the volume in itself. Examples of problems and failures, in fact, abound, and they are candidly recounted\ldots. It is on the basis of a world perceived in a state of evolution and creative tension that the political proposal for co-management illustrated in this volume— because this is what it is— becomes most compelling. Co-management can involve the gradual harmonising, balancing and adjustment of the interests, aspirations and capacities of a variety of actors both within rural communities and in the world at large. The lamp-posts are intelligence, care and equity— the exact opposite of situations in which the stronger forces impose their will on the weaker ones without regard to understandings, results or even meaning, let alone sustainability. The practices that are here described to make a difference are a careful assessment of issues, dialogue, negotiation, the active mediation of conflicts and the nurturing of joint learning. But we would be wrong if we would think that this applies only to specific contexts where local actors are concerned, let us say, with a specific forest, a pastoral landscape, a rare species of wildlife or a rich coastal fishery. “Sharing power” makes a compelling case that continuous engagement of actors and learning must extend to the policy arena, beyond the command and control operations of policy specialists and non-participatory elected leaders. “Sharing Power” is an important contribution to environmental thinking and reflection, at a time of great political and economic challenges throughout the world. It invites us to, and equips us for, a dialogue among different cultures, being those of neighbours or of distant actors, in a respectful and equitable search for new forms of natural resource management. I do not advise you to read this volume cover-to-cover— although you may want to!— but I definitely advise you to go through it, be inspired to understand what it contains, and keep it on your desktop. You will find yourself consulting it over and over again when you need inspiration and practical help about more cooperative ways of managing natural resources.

Later, a signed digraph is used to elicit the different views of the experts on cause-effect relationships. Then feedback loops obtained through the use of this 'cognitive map' help in the logical analysis of the decisions. This study focuses on identifying the government's priorities for information technology given the criteria identified by the experts, and the national goal of developing the information industry. The experts used in this study are drawn from the Institute for the Information Industry in Taiwan-a government agency that is charged with this task. The results indicate that the highest priority should be given to computer software development. The development of computer equipment is the least in terms of preferences. The aims of the study are twofold. First, to help entrepreneurs in determining which information technology areas will be likely to benefit from government incentive programs. Secondly, the government may use the priorities as guidelines for their resource allocation decisions.

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The productivity of tropical forests is driven by climate (precipitation, temperature, and light) and soil fertility (geology and topography). While large-scale drivers of tropical productivity are well established, knowledge on the sensitivity of tropical lowland net primary production to climate anomalies remains scarce. We here analyze seven consecutive years of monthly recorded tropical forest aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in response to a recent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) anomaly. The ENSO transition period resulted in increased temperatures and decreased precipitation during the El Niño dry period, causing a decrease in ANPP. However, the subsequent La Niña wet period caused strong increases in ANPP such that drought-induced reductions were overcompensated. Most strikingly, the climatic controls differed between canopy production (CP) and wood production (WP). Whereas CP showed strong seasonal variation but was not affected by ENSO, WP decreased significantly in response to a 3C increase in annual maximum temperatures during the El Niño period but subsequently recovered to above predrought levels during the La Niña period. Moreover, the climate sensitivity of tropical forest ANPP components was affected by local topography ( water availability) and disturbance history (species composition). Our results suggest that projected increases in temperature and dry season length could impact tropical carbon sequestration by shifting ANPP partitioning toward decreased WP, thus decreasing the carbon storage of highly productive lowland forests. We conclude that the impact of climate anomalies on tropical forest productivity is strongly related to local site characteristics and will therefore likely prevent uniform responses of tropical lowland forests to projected global changes.

The problem is particularly acute in poor nations, such as those in East Africa, where fishing is an important subsistence activity but high fishing intensity and use of destructive gear have resulted in declining catches. In this context developing effective management strategies requires an understanding of how fishers may respond to declines in catch. We examined the readiness of 141 Kenyan fishers to stop fishing under hypothetical scenarios of declines in catch and how socioeconomic conditions influenced their decisions. As expected, the proportion of fishers that would exit the fishery increased with magnitude of decline in catch. Fishers were more likely to say they would stop fishing if they were from households that had a higher material style of life and a greater number of occupations. Variables such as capital investment in the fishery and the proportion of catch sold had weak, nonsignificant relationships. Our finding that fishers from poorer households would be less likely to exit a severely declining fishery is consistent with the literature on poverty traps, which suggests the poor are unable to mobilize the necessary resources to overcome either shocks or chronic low-income situations and consequently may remain in poverty. This finding supports the proposition that wealth generation and employment opportunities directed at the poorest fishers may help reduce fishing effort on overexploited fisheries, but successful interventions such as these will require an understanding of the socioeconomic context in which fishers operate. Resumen:La crisis mundial emergente creada por la declinación de las existencias de peces plantea un reto a los usuarios y manejadores de los recursos. El problema es particularmente agudo en naciones pobres, como las de África del Este, donde la pesca es una importante actividad de subsistencia, pero la alta intensidad de pesca y el uso de equipo destructor han resultado en la declinación de las capturas. En este contexto, el desarrollo de estrategias de manejo efectivas requiere el entendimiento de la respuesta de los pescadores a las declinaciones en la captura. Examinamos la disponibilidad de 141 pescadores kenianos a dejar de pescar bajo escenarios hipotéticos de declinaciones de la captura y la influencia de las condiciones socioeconómicas sobre sus decisiones. Como se esperaba, la proporción de pescadores que dejarían la pesca incrementó con la magnitud de la declinación en la captura. Los pescadores que decían dejarían de pescar provenían de grupos familiares con un estilo de vida muy materializado y un mayor número de ocupaciones. Variables como la inversión de capital en la pesquería y la proporción de la captura tuvieron relaciones débiles, no significativas. Nuestro hallazgo de que pescadores de grupos más pobres tendrían menor disponibilidad de dejar una pesquería en declinación severa es consistente con la literatura sobre trampas de pobreza, que sugiere que los pobres no tienen la capacidad de movilizar los recursos necesarios para sobreponerse a situaciones crónicas de bajos ingresos y consecuentemente permanecen en la pobreza. Este hallazgo soporta la propuesta de que la generación de riqueza y oportunidades de empleo dirigidas a los pescadores más pobres pueden ayudar a reducir el esfuerzo de pesca sobre pesquerías sobreexplotadas, pero intervenciones exitosas como estas requerirán del entendimiento del contexto socioeconómico en que operan los pescadores.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:41:45","2022-10-11T14:41:45Z",NA,"124–130","","1",23,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Kenia; Kenya; arrecife de coral; artisanal fishery; cartera de subsistencia; coral reef; livelihood portfolios; pesquería artesanal; poverty trap; socioeconomics; socioeconomía; trampa de la pobreza","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It promotes functional synergies (win-win situations) as well as trade-offs among various benefits resulting from ecosystem processes. Spatial aspects of heterogeneity and configuration play a major role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services and hence in human wellbeing. Cultural artifacts also contribute to landscape functionality. Because of the underlying areal aspects, an additional term, landscape service has been proposed and is increasingly used (Termorshuizen and Opdam, 2009). We take a particular interest in spatial aspects of this framework and the optimization of trade-offs between landscape services. Firstly, spatial heterogeneity is assessed by means of landscape metrics computed as indicators for landscape services. Landscape heterogeneity is a key measure of biodiversity and contributes to several valuable functions. Habitat connectivity and other measures of landscape structure are also essential criteria for the behavior of metapopulations and for recreational value. Secondly, service providing areas (SPAs) are discussed as the areal basis for service provision. Similarly, service benefiting areas (SBAs) and connecting areas (SCAs) for the transfer of matter, energy and organisms between them are investigated. Place-based assessment addresses such areas. We thus show possibilities for estimating and evaluating landscape units. Thirdly, the landscape consists of the natural environment, artifacts from past human use, current human activity and even social thinking. The landscape services approach in a wider sense allows us to take social/cultural services better into account because they depend strongly on heritage assets, structural characteristics, historical conditions end even cultural specifics; which can hardly be subsumed to ecosystems. Place-based assessment is an appropriate solution for combining several spatial categories. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

So far, most studies have focused on the ecological consequences of above-ground biodiversity loss; yet a large part of Earth's biodiversity is literally hidden below ground. Whether reductions of biodiversity in soil communities below ground have consequences for the overall performance of an ecosystem remains unresolved. It is important to investigate this in view of recent observations that soil biodiversity is declining and that soil communities are changing upon land use intensification. We established soil communities differing in composition and diversity and tested their impact on eight ecosystem functions in model grassland communities. We show that soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling. The average response of all measured ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to indicators of soil biodiversity, suggesting that soil community composition is a key factor in regulating ecosystem functioning.

Increased commercialization, population growth, promotion of fisheries development projects, and the live reef food fish trade are expected to increase demand for the country's reef fish. This paper examines how socioeconomic factors affect the condition of the artisanal multi-species coral reef fishery in six sites in Papua New Guinea. Catch characteristics such as diversity, trophic level and body size by landing site were examined along a fishing pressure gradient. Both exogenous factors such as markets and endogenous factors such as fishing pressure were related to the condition of fish catch. In general, the trophic level and lengths of fish captured in Papua New Guinea were relatively high, but were reduced on reefs with high fishing effort near fish markets. Fisheries showed signs of depletion above c . 25 fishing trips per km 2 per day and the proximity of markets was a better indicator of overfishing than human population size. A cross-scale approach to fisheries management is required in Papua New Guinea to coordinate decentralized local management, limit the intrusion of extractive enterprises, and develop policies that seek to minimize exogenous pressures on marine resources.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:41:44","2022-10-11T14:41:44Z",NA,"73–80","","1",33,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One approach holds that protecting sites should be the primary level for action on the ground, the other that conservation action targeting broader seascapes and landscapes is more important. We address this debate systematically by assessing the appropriate spatial scales of conservation for all 4,239 threatened mammals, birds, tortoises and turtles, and amphibians. We find that, in the short- to medium term, 20% of these species are dependent on conservation at single sites, 62% on multiple sites, 18% on both sites and sea- or landscape-scale efforts, and \textless1% on broad-scale actions alone (where sites are variably sized units that are actually or could potentially be managed for conservation, and “broad scale” refers to sea- or landscape-scale and is determined by the needs of the species in question). Calls for broad-scale conservation action have generally focused on terrestrial birds and mammals, and we confirm that a fifth and a tenth of these, respectively, require conservation action at the landscape scale. However, we also find that two-fifths of threatened freshwater turtles and one-fifth of threatened amphibians depend on broad-scale conservation action to address changes in freshwater processes. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of threatened marine mammals, birds, and turtles require urgent conservation action at the seascape scale. Our key conclusion is that neither site-scale nor broad-scale approaches alone can prevent mass extinction. Although site protection should remain the cornerstone for almost all threatened species, we demonstrate that a substantial proportion and unexpected diversity of threatened species will be lost in the absence of urgent conservation interventions at the sea- or landscape scale.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:41:43","2022-10-11T14:41:43Z",NA,"37–43","","1",1,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation planning; IUCN red list; Scale; Threatened species; area-demanding species; ecological processes","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A fundamental goal of ecological research is to understand and model how processes generate patterns so that if conditions change, changes in the patterns can be predicted. Different approaches have been proposed for modelling species assemblage, but their use to predict spatial patterns of species richness and other community attributes over a range of spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Different methods emphasize different processes of structuring communities and different goals. In this review, we focus on models that were developed for generating spatially explicit predictions of communities, with a particular focus on species richness, composition, relative abundance and related attributes. We first briefly describe the concepts and theories that span the different drivers of species assembly. A combination of abiotic processes and biotic mechanisms are thought to influence the community assembly process. In this review, we describe four categories of drivers: (i) historical and evolutionary, (ii) environmental, (iii) biotic, and (iv) stochastic. We discuss the different modelling approaches proposed or applied at the community level and examine them from different standpoints, i.e. the theoretical bases, the drivers included, the source data, and the expected outputs, with special emphasis on conservation needs under climate change. We also highlight the most promising novelties, possible shortcomings, and potential extensions of existing methods. Finally, we present new approaches to model and predict species assemblages by reviewing promising 'integrative frameworks' and views that seek to incorporate all drivers of community assembly into a unique modelling workflow. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these new solutions and how they may hasten progress in community-level modelling.",2017,"2022-10-11 14:41:43","2022-10-11T14:41:43Z",NA,"169–187","","1",92,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"biotic interactions; dispersal; environmental filter; evolutionary forces; modelling framework; species pool; stochasticity","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Production of accurate country checklists is complicated by the fact that, especially in scientifically neglected regions, the knowledge of the distribution of many species is unsatisfying. When distribution of a given species is insufficiently known, typically there may be apparent gaps in its distribution range. These species are defined here as 'gap species'. In this paper, we analyze the country checklists for rodents and insectivores of the African continent with the aims of (i) identifying the countries having a higher taxonomic uniqueness; (ii) highlighting countries where more research is needed; (iii) producing a list of gap species; and (iv) determining the ecological correlates of being a gap species. For both mammal groups, the important countries because of their low numbers of shared species were D. R. Congo, Cameroon, Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. The countries with highest percentages of endemic taxa were Kenya, South Africa, Somalia and Tanzania for insectivores, and Ethiopia and South Africa for rodents. The number of gap species per country was 0-5 for both insectivores and rodents, with the only exceptions of Togo (12) and Benin (15). Apart from Togo and Benin, the main gap countries for rodents were Nigeria, Chad, Gabon, Burundi, and Rwanda, and for insectivores were Niger and Chad. In both groups, the number of gap species per country was independent on the country area, and both range and body sizes did not influence the probability for a species to have distribution gaps. However, most gap species were tropical forest inhabitants. The biogeographic and conservation implications of these data are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:43","2022-10-11T14:41:43Z",NA,"1755–1793","","7",21,NA,NA,"Spatial turnover and knowledge gap of African smal",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Africa; Conservation; Country lists of species; Country prioritization; Gap species; Insectivores; Rodents","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, no comprehensive and systematic region-or nationwide evaluation of the effectiveness of the network has been conducted. We used habitat suitability models and extent of occurrence of 468 species of vertebrates to evaluate the contribution of the Natura 2000 network to biodiversity conservation in Italy. We also estimated the population size of 101 species inside the Natura 2000 network to assess its capacity to maintain or improve the population status of listed species. In general the Italian Natura 2000 did not seem to integrate existing protected areas well.

In this paper we spatially modelled local people's use and perceptions of benefits from forest ecosystem services in Borneo, from interviews of 1837 people in 185 villages. Questions related to provisioning, cultural/spiritual, regulating and supporting ecosystem services derived from forest, and attitudes towards forest conversion. We used boosted regression trees (BRTs) to combine interview data with social and environmental predictors to understand spatial variation of perceptions across Borneo. Our results show that people use a variety of products from intact and highly degraded forests. Perceptions of benefits from forests were strongest: in human-altered forest landscapes for cultural and spiritual benefits; in human-altered and intact forests landscapes for health benefits; intact forest for direct health benefits, such as medicinal plants; and in regions with little forest and extensive plantations, for environmental benefits, such as climatic impacts from deforestation. Forest clearing for small scale agriculture was predicted to be widely supported yet less so for large-scale agriculture. Understanding perceptions of rural communities in dynamic, multi-use landscapes is important where people are often directly affected by the decline in ecosystem services. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:42","2022-10-11T14:41:42Z",NA,"116–127","","",7,NA,NA,"Spatially explicit perceptions of ecosystem servic",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Boosted regression trees; Borneo; Oil palm; Perception mapping; Questionnaires; Social-ecological system","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this work, I evaluate the impact of species distribution models (SDMs) on the current status of environmental and ecological journals by asking the question to which degree development of SDMs in the literature is related to recent changes in the impact factors of ecological journals. The hypothesis evaluated states that research fronts are likely to attract research attention and potentially drive citation patterns, with journals concentrating papers related to the research front receiving more attention and benefiting from faster increases in their impact on the ecological literature. My results indicate a positive relationship between the number of SDM related articles published in a journal and its impact factor (IF) growth during the period 2000-09. However, the percentage of SDM related papers in a journal was strongly and positively associated with the percentage of papers on climate change and statistical issues. The results support the hypothesis that global change science has been critical in the development of SDMs and that interest in climate change research in particular, rather than the usage of SDM per se, appears as an important factor behind journal IF increases in ecology and environmental sciences. Finally, our results on SDM application in global change science support the view that scientific interest rather than methodological fashion appears to be the major driver of research attraction in the scientific literature.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:42","2022-10-11T14:41:42Z",NA,"e111996","","11",9,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The robustness of such decision-making processes is rarely evaluated, and the influence of decision criteria (or factors) in management decisions is seldom considered. We present a framework for a spatially-explicit sensitivity analysis by using a scheme developed to provide objective guidelines, in the form of static priority maps, for managing woody invasive alien plants (IAPs). Location The Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Methods The model included seven factors related to management history, fire risk, and the age, identity, density and spread of IAPs. Each factor had a weight associated that reflected its relative importance in prioritizing areas for clearing. We changed these factor weights using three approaches of sensitivity analysis and assessed the effect of these changes on the spatial structure of the resulting priority maps in three different management regions. Results Different outcomes arose depending on the importance given to different factors. Priority maps were most sensitive to the fire-related factors, suggesting that fire is both a crucial driver of invasion in fynbos and an overriding determinant of management options. The factor ‘area burnt recently' provided crucial information for the effective clearing of IAPs. The sensitivity of the model to changes in other factors was more context specific: levels of sensitivity were highly dependent on different features of the landscape, especially the spatial heterogeneity of particular factors. Main conclusions By clarifying the importance of factors in shaping priority maps, the sensitivity analysis framework enabled us to identify the necessary factors to produce outcomes matching a pre-selected management strategy. This is important for cost-efficient management, as acquisition and curation of data is expensive. This spatially-explicit sensitivity analysis is, thus, recommended to evaluate the robustness and generality of selected management strategies, and validate the assumptions derived from decision-making protocols.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:41:42","2022-10-11T14:41:42Z",NA,"426–438","","3",16,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation planning; Biological invasions; Cape Floristic Region; Multi-criteria decision model; South Africa; Spatially-explicit sensitivity analysis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In conservation, SARs have been used to predict the number of extinctions when the area of habitat is reduced. Such predictions are most needed for landscapes rather than for individual habitat fragments, but SAR-based predictions of extinctions for landscapes with highly fragmented habitat are likely to be biased because SAR assumes contiguous habitat. In reality, habitat loss is typically accompanied by habitat fragmentation. To quantify the effect of fragmentation in addition to the effect of habitat loss on the number of species, we extend the power-law SAR to the species-fragmented area relationship. This model unites the single-species metapopulation theory with the multispecies SAR for communities. We demonstrate with a realistic simulation model and with empirical data for forest-inhabiting subtropical birds that the species-fragmented area relationship gives a far superior prediction than SAR of the number of species in fragmented landscapes.

The distribution data (size of each species' range in km2) and the relative quantity of each macrohabitat type (in km2) were obtained from the Global Mammal Assessment data bank of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Global Land Cover 2000, respectively. We excluded mainly island species from analyses but included those species that occur on both islands and the mainland. Habitats were grouped according to seven categories (shrubland, forest, grassland, savannah, wetlands, desert, and artificial). Mean range sizes varied significantly among families, with members of the family Cuniculidae having larger ranges than the species belonging to the rest of the families. Mean range size did not differ significantly between endemic and non-endemic taxa. There was a significant positive relation between total species richness and the availability of habitat types. Specialized species (i.e., those linked to a single habitat type) were found especially in forests, but shrublands and grasslands were also important. IUCN threatened species were distributed in a scattered way, and essentially in forests, grasslands, and shrublands. No region of the Neotropics housed more than two to three threatened taxa, apart from a spot in north-central Peru with five species. The richness of IUCN threatened species was higher in the montane forest ecosystems of the Andes, north-central Peru, than in other areas of South America.

Robust predictions of such changes in species' distributions are pivotal for conservation planning and policy making, and are thus major challenges in ecological research. Statistical species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely applied in this context, though they remain subject to criticism as they implicitly assume equilibrium, and incorporate neither dispersal, demographic processes nor biotic interactions explicitly. In this study, the effects of transient dynamics and ecological properties and processes on the prediction accuracy of SDMs for climate change projections were tested. A spatially explicit multi-species dynamic population model was built, incorporating species-specific and interspecific ecological processes, environmental stochasticity and climate change. Species distributions were sampled in different scenarios, and SDMs were estimated by applying generalised linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs). Resulting model performances were related to prevailing ecological processes and temporal dynamics. SDM performance varied for different range dynamics. Prediction accuracies decreased when abrupt range shifts occurred as species were outpaced by the rate of climate change, and increased again when a new equilibrium situation was realised. When ranges contracted, prediction accuracies increased as the absences were predicted well. Far-dispersing species were faster in tracking climate change, and were predicted more accurately by SDMs than short-dispersing species. BRTs mostly outperformed GLMs. The presence of a predator, and the inclusion of its incidence as an environmental predictor, made BRTs and GLMs perform similarly. Results are discussed in light of other studies dealing with effects of ecological traits and processes on SDM performance. Perspectives are given on further advancements of SDMs and for possible interfaces with more mechanistic approaches in order to improve predictions under environmental change.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:41:40","2022-10-11T14:41:40Z",NA,"733–744","","5",32,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If alleles have equal effects, all combinations that result in the same deviation from the optimum are equivalent. Furthermore, the genetic variance that is maintained by mutation-selection balance is $2 \backslashmu/S$ per locus, where $\backslashmu$ is the mutation rate and $S$ the strength of stabilizing selection. In reality, alleles vary in their effects, making the fitness landscape asymmetric, and complicating analysis of the equilibria. We show that that the resulting genetic variance depends on the fraction of alleles near fixation, which contribute by $2 \backslashmu/S$, and on the total mutational effects of alleles that are at intermediate frequency. The interplay between stabilizing selection and mutation leads to a sharp transition: alleles with effects smaller than a threshold value of $2\backslashsqrt{\backslashmu / S}$ remain polymorphic, whereas those with larger effects are fixed. The genetic load in equilibrium is less than for traits of equal effects, and the fitness equilibria are more similar. We find that if the optimum is displaced, alleles with effects close to the threshold value sweep first, and their rate of increase is bounded by $\backslashsqrt{\backslashmu S}$. Long term response leads in general to well-adapted traits, unlike the case of equal effects that often end up at a sub-optimal fitness peak.

The positive and negative aspects of examined SEAs were not clearly communicated. Four main SEA characteristics gave rise to widespread confusion. These include SEA procedure, substantive aspects of SEA application, integration into the underlying policy, plan and programme process, and the role of the sector of its application. In order to clarify SEA methodology and thus enhance its application (and the position of SEA within the tiered decision-making hierarchy), at the beginning of the new millennium a more systematic approach was introduced. This was based on a decision-making hierarchy of policies, plans and programmes with associated tasks, differing mainly in substantive requirements. The three-tier approach helps decision makers to focus on the aspects appropriate to a particular situation. Therefore, the proposed system helps SEA practitioners and planners to obtain a clearer view as to whether they are likely to achieve their intended goals.

Time patterns of biomass predicted by these differential equations, and equilibrium system responses under different exploitation regimes, are found by setting the differential equations equal to zero and solving for biomasses at different levels of fishing mortality. Incorporation of our approach as the ECOSIM routine into the well-documented ECOPATH software will enable a wide range of potential users to conduct fisheries policy analyses that explicitly account for ecosystem trophic interactions, without requiring the users to engage in complex modelling or information gathering much beyond that required for ECOPATH. While the ECOSIM predictions can be expected to fail under fishing regimes very different from those leading to the ECOPATH input data, ECOSIM will at least indicate likely directions of biomass change in various trophic groups under incremental experimental policies aimed at improving overall ecosystem management. That is, ECOSIM can be a valuable tool for design of ecosystem-scale adaptive management experiments.",1997,"2022-10-11 14:41:38","2022-10-11T14:41:38Z",NA,"139–172","","2",7,NA,NA,"Structuring dynamic models of exploited ecosystems",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"bottom-up; fish; fisheries; lates-niloticus; nile perch; population; predation; quantification; strategies; top-down","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, rapid development of computing technology in recent years has made real-time spatial analysis and real-time data visualization become realizable. Based on newly developed methods, Surface Modeling: High Accuracy and High Speed Methods explores solutions to big-error and slow-efficiency problems, two critical challenges that have long plagued those working in with geographical information system (GIS) and computer-aided design (CAD). By developing high accuracy and high speed methods for surface modeling, the book builds a bridge between the mathematical-oriented theory of surface modeling and the user-oriented application where the user is actually able to retrieve information on the method itself. The author examines a novel method of high accuracy surface modeling (HASM) in terms of the fundamental theorem of surfaces. He then analyzes the coefficient matrix and develops an adaptive method of HASM (HASM-AM), a multi-grade method of HASM (HASM-MG), and an adjustment method of HASM (HASM-AD). He uses numerical tests and real world studies to demonstrate that HASM-AM, HASM-MG, and HASM-AD have highly accelerated computational speed, especially for simulations with huge computational work. Building on this, the book discusses a HASM-based method for dynamic simulation (HASM-FDS), and then applies HASM methods to simulate terrains, climate change, ecosystem change, land cover, and soil properties. It demonstrates HASM's potential for simulating population distribution, human carrying capacity, ecosystem services, ecological diversity, change detection, and wind velocity. The book concludes with a discussion of the problems that exist in surface modeling on a global level and evaluates possible solutions to these problems.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:41:37","2022-10-11T14:41:37Z",NA,"","675","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"CRC Press","New York","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the ability of markets to motivate the supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services from agricultural land is uncertain, especially given the future changes in environmental, economic, and social drivers. We quantified the potential supply of these services from the intensive agricultural land of Australia from 2013 to 2050 under four global outlooks in response to a carbon price and biodiversity payment scheme. Each global outlook specified emissions pathways, climate, food demand, energy price, and carbon price modeled using the Global Integrated Assessment Model (GIAM). Using a simplified version of the Land Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, economic returns to agriculture, carbon plantings, and environmental plantings were calculated each year. The supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services was then quantified given potential land use change under each global outlook, and the sensitivity of the results to key parameters was assessed. We found that carbon supply curves were similar across global outlooks. Sharp increases in carbon sequestration supply occurred at carbon prices exceeding 50$tCO2-1 in 2015 and exceeding 65$tCO2-1 in 2050. Based on GIAM-modeled carbon prices, little carbon sequestration was expected at 2015 under any global outlook. However, at 2050 expected carbon supply under each outlook differed markedly, ranging from 0 to 189MtCO2yr-1. Biodiversity services of 3.32% of the maximum may be achieved in 2050 for a 1$B investment under median scenario settings. We conclude that a carbon market can motivate supply of substantial carbon sequestration but only modest amounts of biodiversity services from agricultural land. A complementary biodiversity payment can synergistically increase the supply of biodiversity services but will not provide much additional carbon sequestration. The results were sensitive to global drivers, especially the carbon price, and the domestic drivers of adoption hurdle rate and agricultural productivity. The results can inform the design of an effective national policy and institutional portfolio addressing the dual objectives of climate change and biodiversity conservation that is robust to future uncertainty in both national and global drivers.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:37","2022-10-11T14:41:37Z",NA,"166–181","","1",28,NA,NA,"Supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity se",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Land use change; Scenarios","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Scenarios have been applied increasingly in decision-making about long-term consequences by projecting different possible pathways into the future. Scenario analysis accounts for a higher degree of complexity inherent in systems than the study of individual projects or technologies. MCA is a widely used appraisal method, which assesses options on the basis of a multi-dimensional criteria framework and calculates rankings of options. In our study, five renewable energy scenarios for Austria for 2020 were appraised against 17 sustainability criteria. A similar process was undertaken on the local level, where four renewable energy scenarios were developed and evaluated against 15 criteria. On both levels, the scenario development consisted of two stages: first an exploratory stage with stakeholder engagement and second a modelling stage with forecasting-type scenarios. Thus, the scenarios consist of a narrative part (storyline) and a modeled quantitative part. The preferences of national and local energy stakeholders were included in the form of criteria weights derived from interviews and participatory group processes, respectively. Especially in the case of renewable energy promotion in Austria, the paper systematically analyses the potentials and limitations of the methodology (1) for capturing the complexity of decision-making about the long-term consequences of changes in socio-economic and biophysical systems and (2) for appraising energy futures. The paper concludes that assessing scenarios with PMCA is resource intense, but this methodology captures successfully the context of technology deployment and allows decision-making based on a robust and democratic process, which addresses uncertainties, acknowledges multiple legitimate perspectives and encourages social learning. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

After their failure to achieve a significant reduction in the global rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, world governments adopted 20 new ambitious Aichi biodiversity targets to be met by 2020. Efforts to achieve one particular target can contribute to achieving others, but different targets may sometimes require conflicting solutions. Consequently, lack of strategic thinking might result, once again, in a failure to achieve global commitments to biodiversity conservation. We illustrate this dilemma by focusing on Aichi Target 11. This target requires an expansion of terrestrial protected area coverage, which could also contribute to reducing the loss of natural habitats (Target 5), reducing human-induced species decline and extinction (Target 12), and maintaining global carbon stocks (Target 15). We considered the potential impact of expanding protected areas to mitigate global deforestation and the consequences for the distribution of suitable habitat for \textgreater 10,000 species of forest vertebrates (amphibians, birds, and mammals). We first identified places where deforestation might have the highest impact on remaining forests and then identified places where deforestation might have the highest impact on forest vertebrates (considering aggregate suitable habitat for species). Expanding protected areas toward locations with the highest deforestation rates (Target 5) or the highest potential loss of aggregate species' suitable habitat (Target 12) resulted in partially different protected area network configurations (overlapping with each other by about 73%). Moreover, the latter approach contributed to safeguarding about 30% more global carbon stocks than the former. Further investigation of synergies and trade-offs between targets would shed light on these and other complex interactions, such as the interaction between reducing overexploitation of natural resources (Targets 6, 7), controlling invasive alien species (Target 9), and preventing extinctions of native species (Target 12). Synergies between targets must be identified and secured soon and trade-offs must be minimized before the options for co-benefits are reduced by human pressures.",2016,"2022-10-11 14:41:35","2022-10-11T14:41:35Z",NA,"189–195","","1",30,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aichi targets; Biodiversity; Carbon storage; Convention on Biological Diversity; Forest loss; Protected area; Threatened species; Vertebrates","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These biodiversity conservation efforts also have the potential to maintain or improve the supply of ecosystem services; however, this potential has been poorly explored across Europe. This paper reports on a spatial assessment of the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem services, and conservation status of protected habitats at European scale. We mapped at 10. km resolution ten spatial proxies for ecosystem service supply (four provisioning services, five regulating services and one cultural service) and three proxies for biodiversity (Mean Species Abundance, tree species diversity and the relative area of Natura 2000 sites). Indicators for biodiversity and aggregated ecosystem service supply were positively related but this relationship was influenced by the spatial trade-offs among ecosystem services, in particular between crop production and regulating ecosystem services. Using multinomial logistic regression models we demonstrated that habitats in a favourable conservation status provided more biodiversity and had a higher potential to supply, in particular, regulating and cultural ecosystem services than habitats in an unfavourable conservation status. This information is of utmost importance in identifying regions in which measures are likely to result in cost-effective progress towards both new biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services targets adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:35","2022-10-11T14:41:35Z",NA,"1–12","","",155,NA,NA,"Synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem service",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity indicators; Conservation status; Ecosystem services; European Union; Habitats Directive; Spatial analysis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Consequently, conflicts of interest arise between human economic activities and biodiversity conservation. We used a systematic approach to conservation planning to explore different conservation scenarios for the Apennine populations of wolves (Canis lupus) and bears (Ursus arctos marsicanus) in Italy. The conservation measures we considered were electrified fences and guard dogs to prevent wolves and bears from preying on sheep. We used habitat suitability models of the two species as an estimate of their distributions. Across the study area, we estimated the potential intensity of conflict caused by predation on sheep and the cost of the antipredator measures. We examined scenarios for the conservation of wolves and bears that identified systems of sites where antipredator measures should be applied to either minimize the economic cost of the plan or tackle a predetermined amount of conflict. The overall cost of the conservation plans ranged between euro1,486,000 and euro16,876,000, depending on the scenario and on the size of the conservation target. Because potential conflict intensity (i.e., potential predation) and cost of conflict resolution were correlated, the scenarios that minimized cost also minimized the amount of conflict that was addressed. Conserving these two species by addressing their predation on sheep was up to 4.36 times more expensive than conserving them by providing suitable habitat in areas of low conflict. Yet avoiding conflicts is not always desirable because it can drastically reduce the options for conservation. Choosing a conservation plan requires consideration of the level of threat to the target species and their sensitivity to conflicts.",2007,"2022-10-11 14:41:34","2022-10-11T14:41:34Z",NA,"1455–1462","","6",21,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Antipredator measures; Bear; Habitat suitability modeling; Reserve selection; Wolf","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How many species, and which species, can persist in such landscapes (and analogous seascapes) are open questions. Here we explore two complementary theoretical frameworks to address these questions: species-area relationships and demographic models. We use the terrestrial mammal fauna of Central America to illustrate the application of both frameworks. We begin by proposing a multi-habitat species-area relationship, the countryside species-area relationship, to forecast species extinction rates. To apply it, we classify the mammal fauna by affinity to native and human-dominated habitats. We show how considering the conservation value of countryside habitats changes estimates derived from the classic species-area approach We also examine how the z value of the species-area relationship affects extinction estimates. Next, we present a framework for assessing the relative vulnerability of species to extinction in the countryside, based on the Skellam model of population dynamics. This model predicts the minimum area of contiguous native habitat required for persistence of a species, which we use as an indicator of vulnerability to habitat change. To apply the model, we use our habitat affinity classification of mammals and we estimate life-history parameters by species and habitat type.

It is a 'metamodel' in that it represents a synthesis and a simplification of several existing dynamic global models in both the natural and social sciences at an intermediate level of complexity. The current version of the model contains 234 state variables, 930 variables total, and 1715 parameters. GUMBO is the first global model to include the dynamic feedbacks among human technology, economic production and welfare, and ecosystem goods and services within the dynamic earth system. GUMBO includes modules to simulate carbon, water, and nutrient fluxes through the Atmosphere, Lithosphere, Hydrosphere, and Biosphere of the global system. Social and economic dynamics are simulated within the Anthroposphere. GUMBO links these five spheres across eleven biomes, which together encompass the entire surface of the planet. The dynamics of eleven major ecosystem goods and services for each of the biomes are simulated and evaluated. Historical calibrations from 1900 to 2000 for 14 key variables for which quantitative time-series data was available produced an average R2 of 0.922. A range of future scenarios representing different assumptions about future technological change, investment strategies and other factors have been simulated. The relative value of ecosystem services in terms of their contribution to supporting both conventional economic production and human well-being more broadly defined were estimated under each scenario, and preliminary conclusions drawn. The value of global ecosystem services was estimated to be about 4.5 times the value of Gross World Product (GWP) in the year 2000 using this approach.

However, these studies disagree in their conclusions of how scale influences projected species distributions. In rugged terrain, coarse-scale climate grids may not capture topographically controlled climate variation at the scale that constitutes microhabitat or refugia for some species. Although finer scale data are therefore considered to better reflect climatic conditions experienced by species, there have been few formal analyses of how modeled distributions differ with scale. We modeled distributions for 52 plant species endemic to the California Floristic Province of different life forms and range sizes under recent and future climate across a 2000-fold range of spatial scales (0.008–16 km2). We produced unique current and future climate datasets by separately downscaling 4 km climate models to three finer resolutions based on 800, 270, and 90 m digital elevation models and deriving bioclimatic predictors from them. As climate-data resolution became coarser, SDMs predicted larger habitat area with diminishing spatial congruence between fine- and coarse-scale predictions. These trends were most pronounced at the coarsest resolutions and depended on climate scenario and species' range size. On average, SDMs projected onto 4 km climate data predicted 42% more stable habitat (the amount of spatial overlap between predicted current and future climatically suitable habitat) compared with 800 m data. We found only modest agreement between areas predicted to be stable by 90 m models generalized to 4 km grids compared with areas classified as stable based on 4 km models, suggesting that some climate refugia captured at finer scales may be missed using coarser scale data. These differences in projected locations of habitat change may have more serious implications than net habitat area when predictive maps form the basis of conservation decision making.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:41:33","2022-10-11T14:41:33Z",NA,"473–483","","2","19",NA,NA,"Modeling plant species distributions under future",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 23504785",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; California; Climate change; Downscaling; Habitat; Impacts; Spatial resolution; Terrain; Topography","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here a dynamic vegetation model (Lund Potsdam Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) was adapted to simulate present-day potential vegetation as a baseline for climate change impact assessments in the evergreen and deciduous forests of Bolivia. Results were compared to biomass measurements (819 plots) and remote sensing data. Using regional parameter values for allometric relations, specific leaf area, wood density, and disturbance interval, a realistic transition from the evergreen Amazon to the deciduous dry forest was simulated. This transition coincided with threshold values for precipitation (1400 mm yr-1) and water deficit (i.e., potential evapotranspiration minus precipitation) (-830 mm yr-1), beyond which leaf abscission became a competitive advantage. Significant correlations were found between modeled and observed values of seasonal leaf abscission (R2 = 0.6, p \textless0.001) and vegetation carbon (R 2 = 0.31, p \textless0.01). Modeled Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index showed that dry forests were more sensitive to rainfall anomalies than wet forests. GPP was positively correlated to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation index in the Amazon and negatively correlated to consecutive dry days. Decreasing rainfall trends were simulated to reduce GPP in the Amazon. The current model setup provides a baseline for assessing the potential impacts of climate change in the transition zone from wet to dry tropical forests in Bolivia.

Firstly, we construct a composite biodiversity indicator that integrates quantitative and qualitative changes of biodiversity projected to 2050 for the EU-17 under future IPCC scenarios. Secondly, this indicator is integrated into two simultaneous equation models to capture the marginal impacts of changes in biodiversity on the value of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) due to climate change.Our estimation results confirm the role of biodiversity as a nature-based policy solution for climate change mitigation, shedding light on the policy actions that generate co-benefits by enhancing ecosystems' capacity to mitigate climate change impacts, while conserving biodiversity and sustaining the flows of EGS for human livelihoods. Especially, nature-based mitigation policies are more cost-effective and better at coping with the ethic and inequality issues associated with distributional impacts of the policy actions, compared to the pure technical solutions to improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. However, the strength of biodiversity as a nature-based policy option for climate change mitigation depends on both the nature of the EGS and the geographical area under consideration. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:33","2022-10-11T14:41:33Z",NA,"60–73","","","97",NA,NA,"Modeling the links between biodiversity, ecosystem",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"3SLS; Composite biodiversity indicator; European forest ecosystem services; Natural capital index; Nature-based policy for climate change mitigation; Simultaneous equation modeling","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is increasing consensus about the importance of incorporating these ""ecosystem services"" into resource management decisions, but quantifying the levels and values of these services has proven difficult. We use a spatially explicit modeling tool, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), to predict changes in ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and commodity production levels. We apply InVEST to stakeholder-defined scenarios of land-use/land-cover change in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. We found that scenarios that received high scores for a variety of ecosystem services also had high scores for biodiversity, suggesting there is little tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Scenarios involving more development had higher commodity production values, but lower levels of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However, including payments for carbon sequestration alleviates this tradeoff. Quantifying ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner, and analyzing tradeoffs between them, can help to make natural resource decisions more effective, efficient, and defensible.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:41:33","2022-10-11T14:41:33Z",NA,"4–11","","1","7",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Still, there is a widespread lack of information about the spatial distribution of individual species and biodiversity as a whole. Remote sensing techniques are increasingly used for biodiversity monitoring and especially the combination of LiDAR and hyperspectral data is expected to deliver valuable information. In this study spatial patterns of vascular plant community composition and α-diversity of a temperate montane forest in Germany were analysed for different forest strata. The predictive power of LiDAR (LiD) and hyperspectral (MNF) datasets alone and combined (MNF+LiD) was compared using random forest regression in a ten-fold cross-validation scheme that included feature selection and model tuning. The final models were used for spatial predictions. Species richness could be predicted with varying accuracy (R 2 = 0:26 to 0:55) depending on the forest layer. In contrast, community composition of the different layers, obtained by multivariate ordination, could in part be modelled with high accuracies for the first ordination axis (R 2 = 0:39 to 0:78), but poor accuracies for the second axis (R 2 ≤ 0:3). LiDAR variables were the best predictors for total species richness across all forest layers (R 2 LiD = 0:3, R 2 MNF = 0:08, R 2 MNF+LiD = 0:2), while for community composition across all forest layers both hyperspectral and LiDAR predictors achieved similar performances (R 2 LiD = 0:75, R 2 MNF = 0:76, R 2 MNF+LiD = 0:78). The improvement in R 2 was small (≤0.07)-if any-when using both LiDAR and hyperspectral data as compared to using only the best single predictor set. This study shows the high potential of LiDAR and hyperspectral data for plant biodiversity modelling, but also calls for a critical evaluation of the added value of combining both with respect to acquisition costs. © 2012 by the authors.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:32","2022-10-11T14:41:32Z",NA,"2818–2845","","9","4",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Boruta feature selection; Full-waveform LiDAR; Herb layer; HyMap; Minimum noise fraction transformation; NMDS; Shannon index; Shrub layer; Tree layer","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Economists assume that all human decisions are purposive: people are assumed to optimize some objective function subject to some set of initial conditions, to some set of resource constraints, and to the dynamics of the system being used. The chapter considers two polar cases and one intermediate case. One polar case involves the preservation of wilderness areas or protected parks in 'close to natural' states. A second involves the exploitation of ecosystems to produce foods, fuels and fibers. The intermediate case involves the management of ecosystems to achieve a balance between non-consumptive cultural services with consumptive provisioning services. While the constrained optimization technique applied in all three cases may be unfamiliar, the chapter tries to give the intuition behind it. It also provides a verbal description of each of the three model structures developed. In all cases the social and biogeophysical components of the coupled system are interdependent - connected through a series of feedback loops. Economists refer to such systems as 'general equilibrium systems'. That is, the dynamics of the system in some state are driven by a tendency towards the equilibrium corresponding to that state, and any perturbation has the potential to stimulate responses across the system.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:41:32","2022-10-11T14:41:32Z",NA,"263–277","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"Oxford University Press","Oxford","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199547951.003.0019",NA,NA,NA,"Exploitation; General equilibrium; Human decisions; Modeling coupled systems; Optimal control","/unread","S.

Models that integrate these factors are likely to better predict the outcomes of natural resource management decisions compared to those that do not take these factors into account. We demonstrate how Bayesian Networks can be used to integrate ecological and social data and expert opinion to model the cost-effectiveness of revegetation activities for restoring biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We demonstrate our approach with a case-study in grassy woodlands of south-eastern Australia. In our case-study, cost-effectiveness is defined as the improvement in native reptile and beetle species richness achieved per dollar spent on a restoration action. Socio-ecological models predict that weed control, the planting of trees and shrubs, the addition of litter and timber, and the addition of rocks are likely to be the most cost-effective actions for improving reptile and beetle species richness. The cost-effectiveness of restoration actions is lower in remnant and revegetated areas than in cleared areas because of the higher marginal benefits arising from acting in degraded habitats. This result is contingent on having favourable landowner attitudes. Under the best-case landowner demographic scenarios the greatest biodiversity benefits are seen when cleared areas are restored. We find that current restoration investment practices may not be increasing faunal species richness in agricultural landscapes in the most cost-effective way, and that new restoration actions may be necessary. Integrated socio-ecological models support transparent and cost-effective conservation investment decisions. Application of these models highlights the importance of collecting both social and ecological data when attempting to understand and manage socio-ecological systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:31","2022-10-11T14:41:31Z",NA,"60–67","","","169",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bayesian Networks; Decision making; Expert opinion; Restoration; Revegetation; Socio-ecological systems; Species richness; Uncertainty","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent advances have integrated population dynamic processes into species distribution models (SDMs), to reduce potential biases in predictions and to better reflect the demographic nuances of incremental range shifts. However, there is no clear framework for selecting the most appropriate demographic-based model for a given data set or scientific question. We review the computer-based modelling platforms currently used for the development of either population- or individual-based species range dynamics models. We describe the features and requirements of 20 software platforms commonly used to generate simulations of species ranges and abundances. We classify the platforms according to particular capabilities or features that account for user requirements and constraints, such as (i) ability to simulate simple to complex population dynamics, (ii) organism specificity or (iii) their computational capacities. Using this classification, we develop a protocol for choosing the most appropriate framework for modelling species range dynamics based in data availability and research requirements. We find that the main differences between modelling platforms are related to the way in which they simulate population dynamics, the type of organisms they are able to model and the ecological processes they incorporate. We show that some platforms can be used as generic modelling software to investigate a broad range of ecological questions related to the range dynamics of most species, and how these are likely to change in the future in response to forecast climate and land-use change. We argue that model predictions will be improved by reducing usage to a smaller number of highly flexible freeware platforms. Our approach provides ecologists and conservation biologists with a clear method for selecting the most appropriate software platform that meets their needs when developing SDMs coupled with population-dynamic processes. We argue that informed tool choice will translate to better predictions of species responses to climate and land-use change and improved conservation management.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:41:31","2022-10-11T14:41:31Z",NA,"247–256","","3","6",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biogeography; Climate change; Conservation management; Dispersal; Global change; Landscape dynamics; Mechanistic model; Metapopulation; Population viability analysis; Species distribution models","/unread","Travis, Justin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thus in order to predict and mitigate against the effects of environmental change both drivers should be accounted for. Two endemic plant species in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, Crocus cyprius and Ophrys kotschyi, were used as a case study. We have coupled climate change scenarios, and land use change models with species distribution models. Future land use scenarios were modelled by initially calculating the rate of current land use changes between two time snapshots (2000 and 2006) on the island, and based on these transition probabilities Markov-chain Cellular Automata were used to generate future land use changes for 2050. Climate change scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and B2A were derived from the IPCC reports. Species' climatic preferences were derived from their current distributions using classification trees while habitat preferences were derived from the Red Data Book of the Flora of Cyprus. A bioclimatic model for Crocus cyprius was built using mean temperature of wettest quarter, max temperature of warmest month and precipitation seasonality, while for Ophrys kotschyi the bioclimatic model was built using precipitation of wettest month, mean temperature of warmest quarter, isothermality, precipitation of coldest quarter, and annual precipitation. Sequentially, simulation scenarios were performed regarding future species distributions by accounting climate alone and both climate and land use changes. The distribution of the two species resulting from the bioclimatic models was then filtered by future land use changes, providing the species' projected potential distribution. The species' projected potential distribution varies depending on the type and scenario used, but many of both species' current sites/locations are projected to be outside their future potential distribution.

It is an undertaking made more difficult by the complex nature of biodiversity and the consequent difficulty in accurately gauging its depletion. In the Living Planet Index, aggregated population trends among vertebrate species indicate the rate of change in the status of biodiversity, and this index can be used to address the question of whether or not the 2010 target has been achieved. We investigated the use of generalized additive models in aggregating large quantities of population trend data, evaluated potential bias that results from collation of existing trends, and explored the feasibility of disaggregating the data (e.g., geographically, taxonomically, regionally, and by thematic area). Our results show strengths in length and completeness of data, little evidence of bias toward threatened species, and the possibility of disaggregation into meaningful subsets. Limitations of the data set are still apparent, in particular the dominance of bird data and gaps in tropical-species population coverage. Population-trend data complement the longer-term, but more coarse-grained, perspectives gained by evaluating species-level extinction rates. To measure progress toward the 2010 target, indicators must be adapted and strategically supplemented with existing data to generate meaningful indicators in time.

Soil samples were collected from highly contaminated agricultural soil adjacent to an industrial drain in the Nile Delta named the ""Defsho"" drain, located at the city of Kafr El-Dawar, 20 km south of Alexandria (Longitude 30.12917 and Latitude 31.13972). PCR has become a popular tool for the retrieval of the natural environmental rRNA genes that represent native microbial species. Soil DNA was extracted and the 16S and 18S rRNA genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene cloning. About 5,000 clones were obtained and genotyped using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to fingerprinting the biodiversity in the soil. Clones, which give different peaks with DHPLC, were then subjected to partial sequencing. Five prokaryotic and two eukaryotic out of 1,000 recombinant clones were randomly selected and further studied by DNA sequencing analysis. These clones were designated PT and ET for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. Results confirmed the hazardous effects of pollution on the distribution and biodiversity of soil microorganisms where most of the native beneficial microorganisms were disappeared or non-cultured under these stressed conditions compared to the normal non-polluted soils in the same governorate which is certainly affecting soil fertility and productivity. Five prokaryotic (PT) and two eukaryotic (ET) recombinant clones were randomly selected and further studied by DNA sequence analysis. DNA sequencing revealed that most of the identified bacteria are members of the class Proteobacteria; subdivision Gammaproteobacteria; order Enterobacteriales and family Enterobacteriaceae. Two PT clones (PT2 and PT4) were identified as Shigella flexneri 301-AF499895; members of PT1 and PT3 were related to Escherichia sp. and the uncultured bacterium S000009863 while PT5 was uncultured bacterium-S000331457 in addition to unclassified member of Desulfobacteriaceae, subdivision Deltaproteobacteria. ET1 was uncultured Trichocomaceae clone HC-B1/1-AF548306 and ET2 represents uncultured fungus clone SBS8w47f-AY681463, respectively. In conclusion, the significant decline in the genetic diversity in Defsho soil emphasized the hazardous effect of the industrial pollution on the biodiversity, stability and functioning of the native microbial population.

Many programs that are identified with the purpose of 'surveillance' represent an inefficient use of conservation funds and effort. Here, we revisit the 1964 paper by Platt and argue that his recommendations about the conduct of science are equally relevant to the conduct of ecological monitoring programs. In particular, we argue that monitoring should not be viewed as a stand-alone activity, but instead as a component of a larger process of either conservation-oriented science or management.

Monitoring is crucial to assess the efficacy of measures implemented to reduce the abundance of plastic debris, but it is complicated by large spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the amounts of plastic debris and by our limited understanding of the pathways followed by plastic debris and its long-term fate. To date, most monitoring has focused on beach surveys of stranded plastics and other litter. Infrequent surveys of the standing stock of litter on beaches provide crude estimates of debris types and abundance, but are biased by differential removal of litter items by beachcombing, cleanups and beach dynamics. Monitoring the accumulation of stranded debris provides an index of debris trends in adjacent waters, but is costly to undertake. At-sea sampling requires large sample sizes for statistical power to detect changes in abundance, given the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Another approach is to monitor the impacts of plastics. Seabirds and other marine organisms that accumulate plastics in their stomachs offer a cost-effective way to monitor the abundance and composition of small plastic litter. Changes in entanglement rates are harder to interpret, as they are sensitive to changes in population sizes of affected species. Monitoring waste disposal on ships and plastic debris levels in rivers and storm-water runoff is useful because it identifies the main sources of plastic debris entering the sea and can direct mitigation efforts. Different monitoring approaches are required to answer different questions, but attempts should be made to standardize approaches internationally.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:41:29","2022-10-11T14:41:29Z",NA,"1999–2012","","1526","364",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Marine debris; Mitigation; Monitoring; Plastic; Seabirds; Virgin pellets","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Managing forests in such a way that user groups, sustainability practitioners and forestry institutions all agree to, is not easy. For any reliable consensus to occur, via viable landscape design procedures, through which multiple functions (production, environmental protection and recreation) may be coordinated by means of innovative planning, there is a need to negotiate a set of common objectives and shared responsibilities. This paper examines the policy dimensions of multifunctional forest management, and, through an exploratory case study, proposes an approach for cooperative planning and institutional design. The case study involved two parishes in the Minho region of Portugal (Gavieira and Entre Ambos-os-Rios) combining the local communities, the National Park, and local forestry officers. The case study created, developed and validated two scenario storylines through a series of participatory processes (two focus group meetings, one comprehensive workshop, and one expert meeting). One scenario focussed on continuity of the traditional management patterns, with an emphasis on direct goods such as timber and livestock grazing (traditional multifunctionality). The other concentrated on indirect ecological services, such as soil and water protection, as well as carbon sequestration (new multifunctionality). An attempt was also made to implement the scenario storylines through initiating a pilot project in both of the case study areas. However, there were neither robust planning mechanisms nor adaptive governance systems with the capacity to put into place forest management "" futures"" likely to deliver more sustainable landscape-scale uses in these areas. This paper illustrates the difficulties in forging governance systems that have the capacity and the vision to be able to put sustainable development concepts into practice, even when a coherent package of planning measures are tried out, given a policy setting that is confused, contradictory, and where the "" status quo"" tends to be given prominence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:41:28","2022-10-11T14:41:28Z",NA,"1111–1122","","4","27",NA,NA,"Multifunctional forest management in Northern Port",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Forest management in Portugal; Integrated landscape planning; Multifunctional forests; Rural diversity; Sustainable forest management (SFM)","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the degree of confidence that we can place on future climate-change projections depends on global climate-model performance and involves uncertainties that need to be assessed rigorously via climate-model evaluation. Performance assessments are important because the choice of climate model influences projections of species' range movement and extinction risk. A consensus view from the climate modeling community is that no single climate model is superior in its ability to forecast key climatic features. Despite this, the advantages of using multi-model ensemble-averaged climate forecasts to account for climate-model uncertainties have not been recognized by ecologists. Here we propose a method to use a range of skill and convergence metrics to rank commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) according to their skill in reproducing 20-year observed patterns of regional and global climates of interest, and to assess their consistency with other AOGCMs. By eliminating poorly performing models and averaging the remainder with equal weights, we show how downscaled annual multi-climate-model ensemble-averaged forecasts, which have a strong regional focus, can be generated. We demonstrate that: (1) model ranking (match of simulated to observed conditions) differs according to the skill metric used, as well as the climate variable and season considered; (2) although the multi-model averaged result tends to outperform single models at a global scale, at the continental scale at least some models can perform better than the multi-model average; and (3) forecasts for the Australian region, which are often based on a single AOGCM (CSIRO-3.0), show spatial patterns of change that differ noticeably from ensemble-average projections based on a subset of better-performing AOGCMs. Our suggested approach-novel in the ecology discipline-provides a straightforward, consistent, and defensible method for conservation practitioners and natural-resource managers to generate estimates of future climate change at a spatial resolution suitable for biodiversity impact studies.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:41:28","2022-10-11T14:41:28Z",NA,"3317–3331","","8","21",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"AOGCMs; Atmosphere-ocean general circulation models; Austral rainfall and temperature forecasts; Bioclimate envelope; Biodiversity; Conservation; Extinction risk; GCM; General circulation model; Global climate model; Global warming; Landscape planning; Range movement; Species distribution model","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Models are categorized based on different classification schemes and are reviewed by describing their general characteristics, approaches, and fundamental properties. The review goes beyond traditional MCDA techniques; it describes new modelling approaches to forest management. The second purpose is to describe new MCDA paradigms aimed at addressing the inherent complexity of managing forest ecosystems, particularly with respect to multiple criteria, multi-stakeholders, and lack of information. Comments about, and critical analysis of, the limitations of traditional models are made to point out the need for, and propose a call to, a new way of thinking about MCDA as they are applied to forest and natural resource management planning.

This method uses role games to acquire knowledge, build a MAS model, validate the MAS model, and use it in the decision making process. It is named 'companion modelling' because it is used as a tool in the mediation process, the social dimension of the companion, and it co-evolves with social process, temporal and adaptive dimension. The principles on which this approach was based are covered. The various tests that demonstrated that it is possible to use models this way, and indeed that this method is effective in supervising a collective decision making process, are presented. The different uses of role games and models in the mediation process for co-management of resources are then analysed. Role games are used for the collective construction of a MAS, which is implemented and then presented for discussion.

About one-quarter of all mammals are in danger of extinction, and more than half of all mammal populations are in decline. A major priority for conservation science is to understand the ecological traits that predict extinction risk and the interactions among those predictors that make certain species more vulnerable than others. Here, using a new database of nearly 4,500 mammal species, we use decision-tree models to quantify the multiple interacting factors associated with extinction risk. We show that the correlates of extinction risk vary widely across mammals and that there are unique pathways to extinction for species with different lifestyles and combinations of traits. We find that risk is relative and that all kinds of mammals, across all body sizes, can be at risk depending on their specific ecologies. Our results increase the understanding of extinction processes, generate simple rules of thumb that identify species at greatest risk, and highlight the potential of decision-tree analyses to inform conservation efforts.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:41:28","2022-10-11T14:41:28Z",NA,"10702–10705","","26","106",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a participant/observer perspective, I examine how scenario planning tries to meet certain methodological, organizational and psychological challenges facing today's senior managers. Three prime characteristics are identified as setting the scenario approach apart from more traditional planning tools: (1) the script or narrative approach, (2) uncertainty across rather than within models, and (3) the decomposition of a complex future into discrete states. After exploring the intellectual roots of scenario planning, I examine such organizational aspects as the need for diversity of views and the importance of simplicity and manageability. Both benefits and obstacles to using scenarios in organizations are identified. Cognitive biases are examined as well, especially the well-known biases of overconfidence and the conjunction fallacy. Two experiments test the impact of scenarios on people's subjective confidence ranges. Another two experiments test the internal coherence of subjects' beliefs. The psychological benefit of scenario planning appears to tie in the exploitation of one set of biases (e.g., conjunction fallacies) to counteract another (such as overconfidence).",1993,"2022-10-11 14:41:27","2022-10-11T14:41:27Z",NA,"193–213","","3","14",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Royal Dutch/Shell; Scenario method; cognitive biases; consensus building; planning under uncertainty; probability calibration","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Section 2 will be devoted to a presentation of the conceptual architecture that constitutes the main keys for analyzing and structuring problem situations. Decision aiding cannot and must not be envisaged jointly with a hypothesis of perfect knowledge. Different ways for apprehending the various sources of imperfect knowledge will be introduced in Section 3. A robustness analysis is necessary in most cases.

A framework for assessing key components of decentralization is outlined and applied to Philippine coastal management. Local management is assessed in terms of legal authority to engage in effective management, capacity to manage effectively and the availability of resources for management. The political commitment of local officials, the availability and use of inter-governmental coordination mechanisms and means for assuring accountability are also examined. The assessment indicates that much has been accomplished in building a framework for effective local coastal management, but much remains to be done. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing methods are mostly based on regression, which limits their utility when there are multiple hypotheses to consider and the data are sparse and noisy. Our likelihood-based approach is unbiased with regard to sample size, and its posterior probability landscape allows for the separate consideration of magnitude and certainty for multiple factors simultaneously. As applied to Steller sea lions, the approach uses a stochastic population model in which the vital rates (fecundity, pup survival, non-pup survival) at a particular rookery in each year are functions of one or more local conditions (total prey availability, species composition of available prey, fisheries activity, predation risk indices). Three vital rates and four scaling functions produce twelve nonexclusive hypotheses, of which we considered 10; we assumed a priori that fecundity would not be affected by fishery activities or predation. The likelihood of all the rookery- and year-specific census data was calculated by averaging across sample paths, using backward iteration and a beta-binomial structure for observation error. We computed the joint maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of parameters associated with each hypothesis and constructed marginal likelihood curves to examine the support for each effect. We found strong support for a positive effect of total prey availability on pup recruitment, negative effects of prey species composition (pollock fraction) on fecundity and pup survival, and a positive effect of harbor seal density (our inverse proxy for predation risk) on non-pup survival. These results suggest a natural framework for adaptive management; for example, the areas around some of the rookeries could be designated as experimental zones where fishery quotas are contingent upon the results of pre-fishing season survey trawls. We contrast our results with those of previous studies, demonstrating the importance of testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously and quantitatively when investigating the causes of a population decline.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:41:27","2022-10-11T14:41:27Z",NA,"1932–1955","","8","18",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aerial survey; Beta-binomial observation error; Declining-population paradigm; Eumetopias jubatus; Killer whales; Multiple-hypothesis testing; Optimal foraging; Steller sea lions; Stochastic dynamic programming; Walleye pollock","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The world's governments are calling for biodiversity and ecosystem-service monitoring to guide and evaluate international conservation policy as well as to incorporate natural capital into their national accounts. The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) has been tasked with setting up this monitoring system. Here we explore the immediate feasibility of creating a global ecosystem-service monitoring platform under the GEO BON framework through combining data from national statistics, global vegetation models, and production function models. We found that nine ecosystem services could be annually reported at a national scale in the short term: carbon sequestration, water supply for hydropower, and non-fisheries marine products, crop, livestock, game meat, fisheries, mariculture, and timber production. Reported changes in service delivery over time reflected ecological shocks (e.g., droughts and disease outbreaks), highlighting the immediate utility of this monitoring system. Our work also identified three opportunities for creating a more comprehensive monitoring system. First, investing in input data for ecological process models (e.g., global land-use maps) would allow many more regulating services to be monitored. Currently, only 1 of 9 services that can be reported is a regulating service. Second, household surveys and censuses could help evaluate how nature affects people and provides non-monetary benefits. Finally, to forecast the sustainability of service delivery, research efforts could focus on calculating the total remaining biophysical stocks of provisioning services. Regardless, we demonstrated that a preliminary ecosystem-service monitoring platform is immediately feasible.

The primary objective is to provide a classification framework that will aid in analyzing the human welfare impacts of policy-induced changes in ecosystems. In particular, the goal is to support different types of "" marginal "" analysis, such as cost-benefit and distributional analysis. Measuring the welfare impacts of environmental policy changes typically entails identifying, quantifying, and, in many cases, valuing changes in ecosystems and their contributions to human welfare. NESCS is primarily designed to support the identification of these ecosystem service changes, but in a way that will facilitate the subsequent steps of quantification and valuation. In what ways do the NESCS framework and classification approach help fulfill the primary objectives? NESCS helps identify the distinct pathways through which policy-induced changes in ecosystems ultimately lead to changes in human welfare. It does so in the following ways: The NESCS conceptual framework provides a way to systematically link ecological systems that produce ecosystem services and human systems that directly use these services (i.e., market production systems and households). The NESCS classification system intends to provide an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive categories for linking ecosystem outcomes to direct human uses. What is the approach for developing NESCS? Concepts and methods used to develop existing classification systems for economic goods and services are used to develop a classification system for ecosystem goods and services. Two main economic classification systems are the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS), primarily designed to support the development of National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). NAICS and NAPCS are used to (1) trace the flow of intermediate goods and services between production sectors in the economy, and (2) estimate the value and composition of final goods and services sold to consumers.

In Doñana, SPHs were located inside the protected area and its surroundings, whereas, degraded SPHs were located primarily within the protected areas. In Sierra Nevada, most SPHs and most degraded SPHs were located inside the protected area. SBAs were located in the surrounding territory for both protected areas, especially in the neighboring cities. We also identified the major issues that faced both protected areas and their drivers of change.

The major threats and pressures affecting these Tuscan habitats are highlighted and discussed. Vegetation dynamics proved to be the most important natural/seminatural threat. Another important threat is invasion by/competition with other organisms, mainly invasive alien species.

It has been suggested that decreased nature experience may help to explain the link between urbanization and mental illness. This suggestion is supported by a growing body of correlational and experimental evidence, which raises a further question: what mechanism(s) link decreased nature experience to the development of mental illness? One such mechanism might be the impact of nature exposure on rumination, a maladaptive pattern of self-referential thought that is associated with heightened risk for depression and other mental illnesses. We show in healthy participants that a brief nature experience, a 90-min walk in a natural setting, decreases both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC), whereas a 90-min walk in an urban setting has no such effects on self-reported rumination or neural activity.

Agreeing and implementing governance responses is proving extremely difficult. Policy makers in many jurisdictions now emphasise their ambition to govern using the best available evidence. One obvious source of such evidence is the evaluations of the performance of existing policies. But to what extent do these evaluations provide insights into the difficult dilemmas that governors typically encounter? We address this question by reviewing the content of 262 evaluation studies of European climate policies in the light of six kinds of dilemma found in the governance literature. We are interested in what these studies say about the performance of European climate policies and in their capacity to inform evidence-based policy-making. We find that the evaluations do arrive at common findings: that climate change is framed as a problem of market and/or state failure; that voluntary measures tend to be ineffective; that market-based instruments tend to be regressive; that EU-level policies have driven climate policies in the latecomer EU Member States; and that lack of monitoring and weak enforcement are major obstacles to effective policy implementation. However, we also conclude that the evidence base these studies represent is surprisingly weak for such a high profile area. There is too little systematic climate policy evaluation work in the EU to support systematic evidence-based policy making. This reduces the scope for sound policy making in the short run and is a constraint to policy learning in the longer term. © 2009 The Author(s).",2010,"2022-10-11 14:41:24","2022-10-11T14:41:24Z",NA,"427–445","","3","101",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this context, the participatory development and appraisal of energy scenarios can be useful for enabling stakeholders to explore future energy options and for supporting the national policy discourse. The five renewable energy scenarios considered refer to Austria in the year 2020. The innovative methodology applied, which was developed as part of the ARTEMIS project, examines possible energy futures paths by combining (1) scenario development; (2) multi-criteria evaluation; and (3) a participatory process with stakeholders and energy experts on the national level. Economic, social, environmental and technological impacts as well as revealed social preferences are used for the ranking of the scenarios. Due to the paramount importance of bioenergy in Austria, special emphasis in the scenario development is put on the contribution of biomass. Two main bioenergy issues and their consideration in the ARTEMIS project are explicitly addressed in this paper: the cascadic utilisation of biomass resources and the demand for land area and land area conflicts. Overall, we demonstrate how the methodology can be applied in practice and what insights policy-makers can gain from it. We also explore the methodology's limitations, especially regarding the effort required for participatory scenario building and the availability of stakeholders. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as more about the past behavior of these cy- cles was learned, we have to come to realize that these cycles have seldom been in a true steady state. It appears that variability is as much a fundamental prop- erty of these biogeochemical cycles as it is a property of the climate system in general (see discussion in section 2.5). In this last chapter, we explore the variability of these cycles on a range of timescales, from a few years to several hundred thousand years. In trying to understand the mechanisms that give rise to these variations, we will apply many of the tools and concepts that we have learned in the previous nine chapters. We eill focus on the carbon cycle, because of its central role in biogeochemical cycling and its interaction with climate as a result of the greenhouse gas properties of CO2 in the atmosphere.

We subject these model ecosystems to a variety of harvest policies, including options based on harvesting each species at its maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing rate. We show that widespread application of single-species MSY policies would in general cause severe deterioration in ecosystem structure, in particular the loss of top predator species.

Seasonality of precipitation and fires regulate the N cycle in these water-limited ecosystems, where dry N deposition dominates. Nitrogen accumulation in soils and on plant surfaces results in peaks of availability with the first winter rains. Decoupling between N flushes and plant demand promotes losses via leaching and gas emissions. Differences in P availability may control the response to N inputs and susceptibility to exotic plant invasion. Invasive grasses accumulate as fuel during the dry season, altering fire regimes. California and the Mediterranean Basin are the most threatened by N deposition; however, there is limited evidence for N deposition impacts outside of California.

While the decline has been largest among better-off households, it has taken place throughout the range of household per capita total expenditure. For both adults and children, anthropometric indicators of nutritional status in India are among the worst in the world. While these indicators have shown improvement over time, the rate of progress is slow relative to what might be expected based on international and historical experience. This paper presents the basic facts about growth, poverty and nutrition in India, it points to a number of puzzles, and it sketches a preliminary story that is consistent with the evidence. The reduction in calorie consumption cannot be attributed to declining real incomes, nor to any increase in the relative price of food. Our leading hypothesis, on which much work remains to be done, is that, as real incomes and wages have increased, leading to some nutritional improvement, there has been an offsetting reduction in calorie requirements due to declining levels of physical activity and possibly also to various improvements in the health environment. If correct, this analysis does not imply that Indians are currently adequately nourished; nothing could be further from the truth. Calorie intake has serious limitations as a nutritional intake; while calories are extremely important, there are too many sources of variation in calorie requirements for standard, invariant, calorie-norms to be usefully applied to large sections of the population.

High nitrate concentrations in drinking water are dangerous for human health. In aquatic ecosystems the nitrogen enrichment produces eutrophication, which is responsible for toxic algal blooms, water anoxia, fish kills and habitat and biodiversity loss. • The continuous nitrogen export to waters reduces the capacity of aquatic ecosystems to absorb, reorganise and adapt to external stress, increasing their vulnerability to future unexpected natural or climate events. Key findings/state of knowledge • Nitrogen concentrations in European rivers, lakes, aquifers and coastal waters are high in many regions. In addition nitrate concentrations water increasing in groundwaters, threatening the long term quality of the resource. • In Europe, nitrogen pressures occur over large areas, implying elevated costs for meeting the long-term good chemical and ecological water quality requirements. A significant part of the European population could be potentially exposed to high nitrate values in drinking water if adequate treatments were not in place. Furthermore many of European aquatic ecosystems are eutrophic or at risk of eutrophication. • Nitrogen pressures have reduced biodiversity and damaged the resilience of aquatic ecosystems and continue to pose a threat to the aquatic environment and to the provision of goods and services from the aquatic ecosystems. • Even under favourable land use scenarios the nitrogen export to European waters and seas is likely to remain significant in the near future. The effects of climate change on nitrogen export to water are still uncertain. Major uncertainties/challenges • Policy tools are available within the European Union and under international conventions to mitigate the nitrogen pollution in water, but their full implementation has not been achieved yet throughout Europe. • In many cases a delay in the water quality response to the implementation of measures have been observed, due to previous nitrogen accumulation in soils, sediments or aquifers or to inadequate design of the mitigation plans. • The issue of pollution swapping between environmental compartments has appeared as an important element to be considered by both the scientific and policy perspective. Recommendations • To protect and enhance the European water resources the full implementation of the existing regulations related to nitrogen is necessary, in addition to an efficient environmental monitoring. • Moreover, positive synergies could be obtained by encouraging the integration in the sectoral policies and enhancing interdisciplinarity in the scientific research, especially in support of regional assessments and pollution swapping evaluations",2011,"2022-10-11 14:41:22","2022-10-11T14:41:22Z",NA,"495–510","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"Cambridge University Press","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1017/cbo9780511976988.024",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","Sutton, Mark; Howard, Clare; Erisman, Jan Willem; Billen, Gilles; Bleeker, Albert; Grennfelt, Peringe; van Grinsven, Hans; Grizzetti",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We performed a gap analysis of the entire Natura 2000 system plus national protected areas and all terrestrial vertebrates (freshwater fish excluded). We also evaluated the level of connectivity of both systems, providing therefore a first estimate of the functionality of the Natura 2000 system as an effective network of protected areas. Together national protected areas and the Natura 2000 network covered more than one-third of the European Union. National protected areas did not offer protection to 13 total gap species (i.e., species not covered by any protected area) or to almost 300 partial gap species (i.e., species whose representation target is not met). Together the Natura 2000 network and national protected areas left 1 total gap species and 121 partial gap species unprotected. The terrestrial vertebrates listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives were relatively well covered (especially birds), and overall connectivity was improved considerably by Natura 2000 sites that act as stepping stones between national protected areas. Overall, we found that the Natura 2000 network represents at continental level an important network of protected areas that acts as a good complement to existing national protected areas. However, a number of problems remain that are mainly linked to the criteria used to list the species in the Habitats and Birds Directives. The European Commission initiated in 2014 a process aimed at assessing the importance of the Birds and Habitats Directives for biodiversity conservation. Our results contribute to this assessment and suggest the system is largely effective for terrestrial vertebrates but would benefit from further updating of the species lists and field management.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:41:21","2022-10-11T14:41:21Z",NA,"986–995","","4","29",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Birds Directive; Connectivity; European Union; Gap analysis; Habitats Directive","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Collaboration between climate and LMR scientists and shared understanding of critical challenges for such applications are essential for developing robust projections of climate impacts on LMRs. This paper assesses present approaches for generating projections of climate impacts on LMRs using IPCC-class climate models, recommends practices that should be followed for these applications, and identifies priority developments that could improve current projections. Understanding of the climate system and its representation within climate models has progressed to a point where many climate model outputs can now be used effectively to make LMR projections. However, uncertainty in climate model projections (particularly biases and inter-model spread at regional to local scales), coarse climate model resolution, and the uncertainty and potential complexity of the mechanisms underlying the response of LMRs to climate limit the robustness and precision of LMR projections. A variety of techniques including the analysis of multi-model ensembles, bias corrections, and statistical and dynamical downscaling can ameliorate some limitations, though the assumptions underlying these approaches and the sensitivity of results to their application must be assessed for each application. Developments in LMR science that could improve current projections of climate impacts on LMRs include improved understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that link climate and LMRs and better representations of these mechanisms within more holistic LMR models. These developments require a strong baseline of field and laboratory observations including long time series and measurements over the broad range of spatial and temporal scales over which LMRs and climate interact. Priority developments for IPCC-class climate models include improved model accuracy (particularly at regional and local scales), inter-annual to decadal-scale predictions, and the continued development of earth system models capable of simulating the evolution of both the physical climate system and biosphere. Efforts to address these issues should occur in parallel and be informed by the continued application of existing climate and LMR models. © 2010.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:41:21","2022-10-11T14:41:21Z",NA,"1–27","","1-4","88",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions",2000,"2022-10-11 14:41:21","2022-10-11T14:41:21Z",NA,"349–361","","4","3",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Dispersal; Habitat specific demography; Hutchinsonian n-dimensional niche; Species distributions","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In ecology, biology, and many physical and social sciences, the exponents of these power laws are estimated to draw inference about the processes underlying the phenomenon, to test theoretical models, and to scale up from local observations to global patterns. Therefore, it is essential that these exponents be estimated accurately. Unfortunately, the binning-based methods traditionally used in ecology and other disciplines perform quite poorly. Here we discuss more sophisticated methods for fitting these exponents based on cumulative distribution functions and maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate their superior performance at estimating known exponents and provide details on how and when ecologists should use them. Our results confirm that maximum likelihood estimation outperforms other methods in both accuracy and precision. Because of the use of biased statistical methods for estimating the exponent, the conclusions of several recently published papers should be revisited.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:41:21","2022-10-11T14:41:21Z",NA,"905–912","","4","89",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"binning; distribution; exponent; maximum likelihood estimation; power laws","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The biology and damage of the three main pest species Acarapis woodi, Varroa jacobsoni, and Tropilaelaps clareae is reviewed, along with detection and control methods. The hypothesis that Acarapis woodi is a recently evolved species is rejected. Mite-associated bee pathologies (mostly viral) also cause increasing losses to apiaries. Future studies on bee mites are beset by three main problems: (a) The recent discovery of several new honey bee species and new bee-parasitizing mite species (along with the probability that several species are masquerading under the name Varroa jacobsoni) may bring about new bee-mite associations and increase damage to beekeeping; (b) methods for studying bee pathologies caused by viruses are still largely lacking; (c) few bee- and consumer-friendly methods for controlling bee mites in large apiaries are available.",2002,"2022-10-11 14:41:18","2022-10-11T14:41:18Z",NA,"519–548","","1","45",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, it focuses on policies that address the 'value–action gap' in environmental policy. Using evidence from the author's research connected with the UK Going for Green Sustainable Communities Project in Huntingdonshire, the paper highlights the tensions between national policies that are based on an 'information deficit' model of participation, and local research and experience that posits a more complex relationship between individuals and institutions. While this suggests the need to develop more differentiated policies based on the restructuring of socioeconomic and political institutions, the paper warns against knee-jerk calls for more local, community or public participation which simply replace one set of generalised appeals with another. The paper concludes that greater emphasis must be placed on the negotiation of partnerships that are more sensitive to local diversity, and which involve a more equitable distribution of responsibility between different environmental stakeholders.",1999,"2022-10-11 14:41:18","2022-10-11T14:41:18Z",NA,"257–278","","3","4",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The paper uses a review of previous work to justify a framework based around the following steps: i) define context and establish whether there is a basis for stakeholder engagement in scenario development; ii) systematically identify and represent relevant stakeholders in the process; iii) define clear objectives for scenario development with stakeholders including spatial and temporal boundaries; iv) select relevant participatory methods for scenario development, during initial scenario construction, evaluation and to support decision-making based on scenarios; and v) integrate local and scientific knowledge throughout the process. The application of this framework in case study research suggests that participatory scenario development has the potential to: i) make scenarios more relevant to stakeholder needs and priorities; ii) extend the range of scenarios developed; iii) develop more detailed and precise scenarios through the integration of local and scientific knowledge; and iv) move beyond scenario development to facilitate adaptation to future change.

But in accordance with disciplinary backgrounds, the literature on specific case studies shows still great biases towards either qualitative social science or the numerical modelling perspective. By presenting a comprehensive case study on changes in agriculture for the Alpine region of Davos, Switzerland, the role of the participatory involvement and to what degree it was found instrumental in defining the scenarios for numerical simulation are discussed, and methodological benefits and limitations are outlined in this contribution. In the presented case study, the participatory process was intended to fulfil two functions: First, it aimed to support the elaboration of regional scenarios including their preparation for numerical simulation through an Input-Output Model, a Resource Flux Model, a Land Use Allocation Model and Ecosystem Service Validation; second, raising the issue of long-term development and capacity-building within the region and amongst key stakeholders was an important goal. In the course of the project, the participatory process proved very useful with regard to interest raised amongst the local participants. However, it could not contribute to the elaboration of scenarios for numerical simulation as much as expected. Reasons for that were (1) limitations in the numerical models so that the complexity of the system and the range of possible scenarios had to be reduced for scenario simulation, (2) the ""bottleneck"" between qualitative and quantitative data which had to be overcome, and (3) a shift in priorities for the participatory process towards capacity building in the course of the project which hindered the in-detail elaboration of scenarios for numerical simulation to some extent. From the presented case study and the relevant literature, recommendations to improve the integration of qualitative participatory and quantitative, model-based techniques are finally drawn. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we describe the first web-based multicriteria decision support software called Web-HIPRE, and the use of it in participatory environmental modelling. The world wide web provides new possibilities to support the process, for example, by allowing distributed decision support. The stakeholders can be located in different geographical areas, especially in environmental problems. We illustrate the use of Web-HIPRE in a case dealing with the evaluation of regulation policies for the Lake Päijänne in Finland. Decision analysis interviews were carried out and preference models of some typical stakeholders were collaboratively analyzed in order to increase the understanding of other stakeholders' views. This proved to be an applicable approach in trying to reach consensus between the stakeholders. Web-HIPRE also provided a flexible way to allow complementary support via the web. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This has stimulated research that pays specific attention to the social causes and consequences of land use change and land degradation. Improving the management of complex environmental problems through land use planning has resulted in policy makers becoming increasingly aware of the need to place emphasis upon problem analysis. This has involved placing greater institutional value upon widening the decision-making community to include actors not normally considered as 'experts' but who possess equally valid and valuable knowledge and perspectives of the realities of the problems affecting their region. Active involvement of the wider stakeholder community can play a crucial function in better consideration of problems by identifying different stakeholder perspectives, provide an active learning arena for all those involved, and provide an interactive basis necessary for generating joined-up thinking. Scenario construction is one such approach that can be used to actively engage stakeholders. This paper will describe the theory surrounding interactive stakeholder involvement, reflecting upon a two-part workshop process for undertaking a participatory scenario construction process in the Northern Mediterranean region. The case study will be used to illustrate the opportunities such interactive approaches can provide for communities having to deal with complex issues surrounding their region. The focus is upon creating greater awareness of the value and need for more fundamental institutional recognition in support of greater actor involvement and interactive dialogue in problem definition, planning and decision-making. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Participatory scenario planning (PSP) is an increasingly popular tool in place-based environmental research for evaluating alternative futures of social-ecological systems. Although a range of guidelines on PSP methods are available in the scientific and grey literature, there is a need to reflect on existing practices and their appropriate application for different objectives and contexts at the local scale, as well as on their potential perceived outcomes. We contribute to theoretical and empirical frameworks by analyzing how and why researchers assess social-ecological systems using place-based PSP, hence facilitating the appropriate uptake of such scenario tools in the future. We analyzed 23 PSP case studies conducted by the authors in a wide range of social-ecological settings by exploring seven aspects: (1) the context; (2) the original motivations and objectives; (3) the methodological approach; (4) the process; (5) the content of the scenarios; (6) the outputs of the research; and (7) the monitoring and evaluation of the PSP process. This was complemented by a reflection on strengths and weaknesses of using PSP for the place-based social-ecological research. We conclude that the application of PSP, particularly when tailored to shared objectives between local people and researchers, has enriched environmental management and scientific research through building common understanding and fostering learning about future planning of social-ecological systems.

In Vietnam, the remarkable economic growth that resulted from the doi moi (renovation)$\backslash$nreforms was based largely on the rural households that had become the new basic unit of agricultural$\backslash$nproduction in the early 1990s. The technical, economic, and social changes that accompanied the$\backslash$ndecollectivization process transformed agricultural production, resource management, land use, and the$\backslash$ninstitutions that defined access to resources and their distribution. Combined with the extreme biophysical,$\backslash$ntechnical, and social heterogeneity encountered in the northern mountains, these rapid changes led to the$\backslash$nextreme complexity of the agrarian dynamics that today challenges traditional diagnostic approaches. Since$\backslash$n1999, a participatory simulation method has been developed to disentangle the cause-and-effect$\backslash$nrelationships between the different driving forces and changes in land use observed at different scales.$\backslash$nSeveral tools were combined to understand the interactions between human and natural systems, including$\backslash$na narrative conceptual model, an agent-based spatial computational model (ABM), a role-playing game,$\backslash$nand a multiscale geographic information system (GIS). We synthesized into an ABM named SAMBA-GIS$\backslash$nthe knowledge generated from the above tools applied to a representative sample of research sites. The$\backslash$nmodel takes explicitly into account the dynamic interactions among: (1) farmers' strategies, i.e., the$\backslash$nindividual decision-making process as a function of the farm's resource profile; (2) the institutions that$\backslash$ndefine resource access and usage; and (3) changes in the biophysical and socioeconomic environment. The$\backslash$nnext step consisted of coupling the ABM with the GIS to extrapolate the application of local management$\backslash$nrules to a whole landscape. Simulations are initialized using the layers of the GIS, e.g., land use in 1990,$\backslash$naccessibility, soil characteristics, etc., and statistics available at the village level, e.g., population, ethnicity,$\backslash$nlivestock, etc. At each annual time step, the agrarian landscape changes according to the decisions made$\backslash$nby agent-farmers about how to allocate resources such as labor force, capital, and land to different productive$\backslash$nactivities, e.g., crops, livestock, gathering of forest products, off-farm activities. The participatory$\backslash$nsimulations based on SAMBA-GIS helped identify villages with similar land-use change trajectories to$\backslash$nwhich the same types of technical and/or institutional innovations could be applied. Scenarios of land-use$\backslash$nchanges were developed with local stakeholders to assess the potential impact of these changes on the$\backslash$nnatural resource base and on agricultural development. This adaptive approach was gradually refined$\backslash$nthrough interactions between researchers and the local population.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:41:16","2022-10-11T14:41:16Z",NA,"27","","1","10",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"agent-based model; geographic information; land-use change; mountain agriculture; participatory simulation; role-playing game; systems; vietnam","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We applied the OS, using Miradi, to five widely varied conservation projects as the foundation for this perspective. We find, in general, that the OS are logical, clear, and provide a robust hierarchical structure from which to organize management action and track progress toward conservation project goals. One goal of the Conservation Measures Partnership in creating the OS is to foster a community of practice for conservation. To better accomplish this, we recommend working toward: (1) creating a library of case studies to illustrate tension between structure and flexibility in the OS for project management; (2) broadening definitions of conservation targets and threats to accommodate the variety of conservation projects; (3) developing critical linkages between the OS to complementary conservation tools (e.g., structured decision-making, spatial planning tools); (4) clearly distinguishing between using threats rankings for action prioritization given expert opinion versus testing hypotheses to gain a mechanistic understanding of cause and effect; and (5) developing rapid assessment tools for the OS to better discern when conservation projects should invest in the cost of fully developing a plan using the OS.

The end- goal of ecosystem service assessment is usually to estimate marginal values of ecosystem services to inform decisions where trade-offs in ecosystem service provision will affect human well-being. Because our ability to estimate the provision of ecosystem services underlies our ability to estimate their societal values, the theoretical bases of GIS approaches and models for assessing ecosystem services need to be well understood before they are employed for decision-making purposes.

Here, we demonstrate advances in dynamic landscape metapopulation modelling and its use as a decision support tool for evaluating the impacts of forest management scenarios. This novel modelling framework incorporates both landscape and metapopulation model stochasticity and allows their relative contributions to model output variance to be characterized. It includes a detailed sensitivity analysis, allowing defensible uncertainty bounds and the priori- tization of future data gathering to reduce model uncertainties. We demonstrate this framework by modelling the landscape- level impacts of eight forest management scenarios on the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818)) in the boreal forest of Ontario, Canada, using the RAMAS Landscape package. The 100 year forest management scenarios ranged in intensity of timber harvesting and fire suppression. All scenarios including harvesting predicted decreases in salamander population size and the current style of forest management is predicted to produce a 9%–17% decrease in expected mini- mum population size compared with scenarios without harvesting. This method is amenable to incorporating many forms of environmental change and allows a meaningful treatment of uncertainty.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:13","2022-10-11T14:41:13Z",NA,"1091–1106","","6",42,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This textbook, the first of its kind, provides for a state-ofthe-art review of SEA theory and practice and promotes a more systematic approach to SEA. It is written for a wide student, professional and academic audience and aims particularly at supporting the development of SEA modules in undergraduate and postgraduate planning, environmental assessment, engineering and law courses. It provides an overview of the fundamental principles and rules of SEA, reports systematically on international SEA practice and theory and pushes the envelope by developing the theory.

The model quantifies the relative suitability of environments for 15 forests classes using the best information that is available: A structural-environmental classification of forest types, vegetation maps and spatial estimates of environmental variables. Inputs to the model include climate variables, soil parent material classes and terrain variables. The model is highly successful at distinguishing the relative suitability of environments for the forest classes with 75% of the forest mosaic accurately predicted by the model at a one hectare resolution over more than two million hectares. The model was used to estimate potential forest distributions in several climates occurring since the end of the last glacial period. These distributions shift dramatically in response to scenarios representing past climates. Certain locations are occupied by a forest class in only some climates while others are always occupied by the same class despite large changes in regional mean annual temperature and precipitation. Using the model to assess the possible impacts of future climate change and estimating the pre-settlement distribution of forest types in the region is also discussed. The coupling of neural networks with a cellular automata model is also described as a means to assess the importance of spatial constraints on the potential redistribution of forest types in the future. The usefulness of artificial neural networks when applied to vegetation change studies in our region suggests that this approach could be applied in many tropical regions, where floristic diversity is high and mechanistic understanding is comparatively low. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A sample of 121 households were monitored over a 16-month period, using a combination of participatory and quantitative survey techniques, to assess their wealth and their production, consumption and market sales of wild foods. Households varied in wealth but all could be considered subject to extreme poverty (income below US$1 per capita per day). Our analyses indicate that wild foods play a small role in household consumption but a major role in household income. Hence, over 90% of both bushmeat and fish production is sold at market. In addition, the value of wild foods increases in the ""lean season"" when agricultural production is low. We also find that the poorest households in this community are unable to capitalise on the most valuable wild foods, bushmeat and fish, as a source of food or cash income. We use an entitlements framework to explain the factors that determine such wealth-related variation between households, indicating that household use of wild foods is determined more by social and economic constraints than by resource abundance in this community. Nevertheless, our findings show that overall the small-scale commercialisation of wild foods provides a vital source of income for rural households living in extreme poverty. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure.

The success of the programme is largely attributed to it being mainly funded as a poverty-relief initiative, although water users also contribute through their water fees. Nevertheless, as the hydrological benefits have become apparent, water utilities and municipalities have begun to contract WfW to restore catchments that affect their water supplies. This emerging PES system differs from others in that the service providers are previously unemployed individuals that tender for contracts to restore public or private lands, rather than the landowners themselves. The model has since expanded into other types of ecosystem restoration and these have the potential to merge into a general programme of ecosystem service provision within a broader public works programme. There is a strong case for concentrating on the most valuable services provided by ecosystems, such as water supply, carbon sequestration, and fire protection, and using these as 'umbrella services' to achieve a range of conservation goals. The future prospects for expansion of PES for hydrological services are further strengthened by the legal requirement that Catchment Management Agencies be established. These authorities will have an incentive to purchase hydrological services through organisations such as WfW so as to be able to supply more water to their users. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food sources, diseases, and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems) underpins the general decline in insect-pollinator populations. Interdisciplinary research on the nature and impacts of these interactions will be needed if human food security and ecosystem function are to be preserved.

Moreover, we assessed the extent to which by the end of the 21(st) century such hotspots will be exposed to average monthly temperature and precipitation patterns which can be regarded as extreme if compared to the climate experienced during 1950-2000. In particular, we considered the entire European sub-continent plus Turkey and a total of 1149 species of terrestrial vertebrates. For each species, we developed species-specific expert-based distribution models (validated against field data) which we used to calculate species richness maps for mammals, breeding birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Considering four global circulation model outputs and three emission scenarios, we generated an index of risk of exposure to extreme climates, and we used a bivariate local Moran's I to identify the areas with a significant association between hotspots of diversity and high risk of exposure to extreme climates. Our results outline that the Mediterranean basin represents both an important hotspot for biodiversity and especially for threatened species for all taxa. In particular, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas host particularly high species richness as measured over all groups, while the eastern Mediterranean basin is particularly rich in amphibians and reptiles; the islands (both Macaronesian and Mediterranean) host the highest richness of threatened species for all taxa occurs.

Global climate has changed significantly during the past 30 years and especially in northern temperate regions which have experienced poleward shifts in temperature regimes. While there is evidence that some species have responded by moving their distributions to higher latitudes, the efficiency of this response in tracking species climatic niche boundaries over time has yet to be addressed. 2. Here, we provide a continental assessment of the temporal structure of species responses to recent spatial shifts in climatic conditions. We examined geographic associations with minimum winter temperature for 59 species of winter avifauna at 476 Christmas Bird Count circles in North America from 1975 to 2009 under three sampling schemes that account for spatial and temporal sampling effects. 3. Minimum winter temperature associated with species occurrences showed an overall increase with a weakening trend after 1998. Species displayed highly variable responses that, on average and across sampling schemes, contained a strong lag effect that weakened in strength over time. In general, the conservation of minimum winter temperature was relevant when all species were considered together but only after an initial lag period (c. 35 years) was overcome. The delayed niche tracking observed at the combined species level was likely supported by the post1998 lull in the warming trend. 4. There are limited geographic and ecological explanations for the observed variability, suggesting that the efficiency of species responses under climate change is likely to be highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. This outcome is likely to be even more pronounced and time lags more persistent for less vagile taxa, particularly during the periods of consistent or accelerating warming. Current modelling efforts and conservation strategies need to better appreciate the variation, strength and duration of lag effects and their association with climatic variability. Conservation strategies in particular will benefit through identifying and maintaining dispersal corridors that accommodate diverging dispersal strategies and timetables.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:09","2022-10-11T14:41:09Z",NA,"914–925","","4",81,NA,NA,"Tracking of climatic niche boundaries under recent",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Christmas bird count; Climate change; Distributional response; Lag effects; Niche tracking; North America; Temperature niche; Winter avifauna","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The nexus of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and the climate system is an important example. LULCC contributes to global and regional climate change, while climate affects the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and LULCC. However, at present, LULCC is poorly represented in global circulation models (GCMs). LULCC models that are explicit about human behaviour and decision-making processes have been developed at local to regional scales, but the principles of these approaches have not yet been applied to the global scale level in ways that deal adequately with both direct and indirect feedbacks from the climate system. In this article, we explore current knowledge about LULCC modelling and the interactions between LULCC, GCMs and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). In doing so, we propose new ways forward for improving LULCC representations in Earth system models. We conclude that LULCC models need to better conceptualise the alternatives for upscaling from the local to global scale. This involves better representation of human agency, including processes such as learning, adaptation and agent evolution, formalising the role and emergence of governance structures, institutional arrangements and policy as endogenous processes and better theorising about the role of teleconnections and connectivity across global networks. Our analysis underlines the importance of observational data in global-scale assessments and the need for coordination in synthesising and assimilating available data.\textless/p\textgreater",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:09","2022-10-11T14:41:09Z",NA,"117–137","","1",5,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Turkwel River and its floodplain sustain a thick forest, which is used for grazing and extraction of non-timber forest products. However, sedentarisation and agricultural expansion have resulted in localised clear-felling of trees, while river damming has altered the natural flow regime. A series of structured, semi-structured, and group interviews were combined with a botanical inventory in order to assess the relevance of TEK to ecological research and forest conservation. Turkana informants gave 102 vernacular names for the 113 woody species. Of these, 85% had a domestic or pastoral use among the 105 specific uses that were described. Ethnobotanical knowledge was relatively homogenous and not related to age, gender, or source of livelihood. The informants had in-depth knowledge of some key ecological processes. The conceived threats to forest survival were primarily cultivation and permanent settlements, while the effects of river damming and livestock grazing were disputed. A claimed decline in rainfall was confirmed by official data. There is strong evidence that TEK could be used to generate hypotheses for research and to design sustainable conservation strategies. A revised version of the indigenous system of tree management should be incorporated into the official forestry policy in order to resolve future conflicts between pastoralists and cultivators",2007,"2022-10-11 14:41:08","2022-10-11T14:41:08Z",NA,"1471–1489","","5",16,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation; Ethnobotany; Ethnoecology; Floodplain forest; Indigenous knowledge; Non-timber forest products; Turkwel River; Woody species richness","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analyse future trade scenarios covering the period of 2005-2045 by evaluating economic and environmental effects using the global land-use model MAgPIE ("" Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment"" ). This is the first trade study using spatially explicit mapping of land use patterns and greenhouse gas emissions. We focus on three scenarios: the reference scenario fixes current trade patterns, the policy scenario follows a historically derived liberalisation pathway, and the liberalisation scenario assumes a path, which ends with full trade liberalisation in 2045.Further trade liberalisation leads to lower global costs of food. Regions with comparative advantages like Latin America for cereals and oil crops and China for livestock products will export more. In contrast, regions like the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia face the highest increases of imports. Deforestation, mainly in Latin America, leads to significant amounts of additional carbon emissions due to trade liberalisation. Non-CO 2 emissions will mostly shift to China due to comparative advantages in livestock production and rising livestock demand in the region. Overall, further trade liberalisation leads to higher economic benefits at the expense of environment and climate, if no other regulations are put in place. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:08","2022-10-11T14:41:08Z",NA,"189–209","","1",22,NA,NA,"Trading more food",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"GHG emissions; International trade; Land use change; Land use model","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Point locality data can minimize commission errors, but those obtained from museum collections are generally sparse, suffer from substantial spatial bias and contain large omission errors. Geographic ranges generate large commission errors because they assume homogenous species distributions. Predicted distribution data make explicit inferences on species occurrence and their commission and omission errors depend on model structure, on the omission of variables that determine species distribution and on data resolution. Omission errors lead to identifying networks of areas for conservation action that are smaller than required and centred on known species occurrences, thus affecting the comprehensiveness, representativeness and efficiency of selected areas. Commission errors lead to selecting areas not relevant to conservation, thus affecting the representativeness and adequacy of reserve networks.

Potentially, ecosystems show nonlinear responses to land-use intensification that would open management options with limited ecological losses but satisfying economic gains. However, multidisciplinary studies to quantify ecological losses and socioeconomic tradeoffs under different management options are rare. Here, we evaluate opposing land use strategies in cacao agroforestry in Sulawesi, Indonesia, by using data on species richness of nine plant and animal taxa, six related ecosystem functions, and on socioeconomic drivers of agroforestry expansion. Expansion of cacao cultivation by 230% in the last two decades was triggered not only by economic market mechanisms, but also by rarely considered cultural factors. Transformation from near-primary forest to agroforestry had little effect on overall species richness, but reduced plant biomass and carbon storage by ≈75% and species richness of forest-using species by ≈60%. In contrast, increased land use intensity in cacao agroforestry, coupled with a reduction in shade tree cover from 80% to 40%, caused only minor quantitative changes in biodiversity and maintained high levels of ecosystem functioning while doubling farmers' net income. However, unshaded systems further increased income by ≈40%, implying that current economic incentives and cultural preferences for new intensification practices put shaded systems at risk. We conclude that low-shade agroforestry provides the best available compromise between economic forces and ecological needs. Certification schemes for shade-grown crops may provide a market-based mechanism to slow down current intensification trends. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",2007,"2022-10-11 14:41:08","2022-10-11T14:41:08Z",NA,"4973–4978","","12",104,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on interdisciplinary research into complex processes of long term, structural change in society, basic tenets for complexity-based governance are formulated. These tenets are translated into a framework that distinguishes between four different types of governance activities and their respective roles in societal transitions. This framework can be used for implementation of governance strategies and instruments. The approach and framework have been developed deductively and inductively in the Netherlands since 2000.

All information, i.e., the rules, models and facts, can be assigned to positions in Cartesian space. The shell has been coupled to a knowledge base containing information on fire behaviour and the effects of fire on vegetation in part of Kakadu National Park, Northern Australia. This system is now installed at the Park headquarters. The information has been derived from experiments run over ten years and from general experience of the region. The first part of the base contains a model of fire behaviour believed to be applicable throughout the Park; the second part (fire effects) is restricted to regions typified by the experimental site. The expert system will be run and assessed by Park managers over the next few years. The system is flexible and allows the managers to modify rules and change 'facts' as further knowledge of fire behaviour and effects becomes available and to add mathematical models of fire behaviour when these have been calibrated for northern Australia.

Pollination maps had a moderate similarity. Differences among the maps were caused by differences in indicator definition, level of process understanding, mapping aim, data sources and methodology. Absence of suitable observed data on ecosystem services provisioning hampers independent validation of the maps. Consequently, there are, so far, no accurate measures for ecosystem service map quality. Policy makers and other users need to be cautious when applying ecosystem service maps for decision-making. The results illustrate the need for better process understanding and data acquisition to advance ecosystem service mapping, modelling and validation.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:06","2022-10-11T14:41:06Z",NA,"e109643","","10",9,NA,NA,"Uncertainties in Ecosystem Service Maps",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","Yue, Gen Hua",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While simple models with low data and expertise requirements are attractive, their use as decision-aid tools should be supported by uncertainty characterization. We assessed the performance of the InVEST annual water yield model, a popular tool for ecosystem service assessment based on the Budyko framework. Our study involved the comparison of ten subcatchments in the Cape Fear watershed, NC, ranging in size and land use configuration. We analyzed the model sensitivity to the eco-hydrological parameters and the effect of extrapolating a lumped theory to a fully distributed model. Comparison of the model predictions with observations and with a lumped water balance model confirmed that the model is able to represent differences in land uses. Our results also emphasize the effect of climate input errors, especially annual precipitation, and errors in the eco-hydrological parameter \textlessi\textgreaterZ\textless/i\textgreater, which are both comparable to the model structure uncertainties. In practice, our case study supports the use of the model for predicting land use change effect on water provisioning, although its use for identifying areas of high water yield will be influenced by precipitation errors. While the results are inherently local, analysis of the model structure suggests that many insights from this study will hold globally.

The magnetoresistance (MR) at 2 K is positive and linear (LPMR) at low field and becomes negative and quadratic at higher field. While the negative part is known from the reduction of the hybridization gap due to Zeeman splitting, the positive dependence is similar to what has been observed in other topological insulators (TI). We conclude that the LPMR is a characteristic feature of TI and is related to the linear dispersion near the Dirac cone. The Hall resistance shows a sign change around 50 K. It peaks and becomes nonlinear at around 10 K then decreases below 10 K. This indicates that carriers with opposite signs emerge below 50 K.

We examined how ecosystem service bundles and trade-offs emerge from diverging social preferences toward ecosystem services delivered by various types of ecosystems in Spain. We conducted 3,379 direct face-to-face questionnaires in eight different case study sites from 2007 to 2011. Overall, 90.5% of the sampled population recognized the ecosystem's capacity to deliver services. Formal studies, environmental behavior, and gender variables influenced the probability of people recognizing the ecosystem's capacity to provide services. The ecosystem services most frequently perceived by people were regulating services; of those, air purification held the greatest importance. However, statistical analysis showed that socio-cultural factors and the conservation management strategy of ecosystems (i.e., National Park, Natural Park, or a non-protected area) have an effect on social preferences toward ecosystem services. Ecosystem service trade-offs and bundles were identified by analyzing social preferences through multivariate analysis (redundancy analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis). We found a clear trade-off among provisioning services (and recreational hunting) versus regulating services and almost all cultural services. We identified three ecosystem service bundles associated with the conservation management strategy and the rural-urban gradient.

To use this approach managers must have clearly-stated objectives, a set of regulatory options, and a mathematical description of the managed system. We used dynamic programming to derive optimal harvest strategies for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in which we balanced the competing objectives of maximizing long-term cumulative harvest and achieving a specified population goal. Model-specific harvest strategies, which account for random variation in wetland conditions on the breeding grounds and for uncertainty about the relation between hunting regulations and harvest rates, are provided and compared.

The time and distance between the producer and the consumer of ecosystem services can be considered lags in ecosystem-service provisioning. Incorporation of heterogeneity and lag effects into conservation incentives helps identify appropriate governance systems and incentive mechanisms for effective ecosystem-service management. These spatiotemporal dimensions are particularly apparent in river—riparian systems, which provide a suite of important ecosystem services and promote biodiversity conservation at multiple scales, including habitat protection and functional connectivity.

Here, a potential solution, the preservation of the information content of fine-scale measurements, is highlighted using modeled net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of an Arctic tundra landscape as an example. The variance of aggregated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), measured from an airborne platform, decreased linearly with log(scale), resulting in a linear relationship between log(scale) and the scale-wise modeled NEE estimate. Preserving three units of information, the mean, variance and skewness of fine-scale NDVI observations, resulted in upscaled NEE estimates that deviated less than 4% from the fine-scale estimate. Preserving only the mean and variance resulted in nearly 23% NEE bias, and preserving only the mean resulted in larger error and a change in sign from CO2 sink to source. Compressing NDVI maps by 70-75% using wavelet thresholding with the Haar and Coiflet basis functions resulted in 13% NEE bias across the study domain. Applying unique scale-dependent transfer functions between NDVI and leaf area index (LAI) decreased, but did not remove, bias in modeled flux in a smaller expanse using handheld NDVI observations. Quantifying the parameters of statistical distributions to preserve ecological information reduces bias when upscaling and makes possible spatial data assimilation to further reduce errors in estimates of ecological processes across scale. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:41:04","2022-10-11T14:41:04Z",NA,"971–986","","7",24,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Abisko; Information content; Information theory; Leaf area index; Net ecosystem exchange; Normalized difference vegetation index; Skew-normal distribution; Tundra; Upscaling; Wavelet decomposition","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While IUCN's vision is to increase the taxonomic coverage of the Red List, no adequate plan exists to keep it up to date. As species assessments become outdated after 10 years under IUCN rules, our simulations reveal that with the limited budget currently available for reassessment, most of the Red Listing effort may be wasted soon. Indeed, 17% of the species' assessments are already outdated. To minimize the budget needed to keep assessments up to date in the Red List, we propose a mixed strategy of online reassessments and budget growth. We show that largely replacing workshops with online consultations is a more sustainable strategy that would save U.S. $2.8million per year (35% of the budget).

Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most sensitive determinants of plant production and can vary by an order of magnitude over short distances. The landscape distribution of LAI is generally determined by remote sensing of surface reflectance (e.g. normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) but the mismatch in scales between ground and satellite measurements complicates LAI upscaling. Here, we describe a series of measurements to quantify the spatial distribution of LAI in a sub-Arctic landscape and then describe the upscaling process and its associated errors. Working from a fine-scale harvest LAI-NDVI relationship, we collected NDVI data over a 500 m × 500 m catchment in the Swedish Arctic, at resolutions from 0.2 to 9.0 m in a nested sampling design. NDVI scaled linearly, so that NDVI at any scale was a simple average of multiple NDVI measurements taken at finer scales. The LAI-NDVI relationship was scale invariant from 1.5 to 9.0 m resolution. Thus, a single exponential LAI-NDVI relationship was valid at all these scales, with similar prediction errors. Vegetation patches were of a scale of ∼0.5 m and at measurement scales coarser than this, there was a sharp drop in LAI variance. Landsat NDVI data for the study catchment correlated significantly, but poorly, with ground-based measurements. A variety of techniques were used to construct LAI maps, including interpolation by inverse distance weighting, ordinary Kriging, External Drift Kriging using Landsat data, and direct estimation from a Landsat NDVI-LAI calibration. All methods produced similar LAI estimates and overall errors. However, Kriging approaches also generated maps of LAI estimation error based on semivariograms. The spatial variability of this Arctic landscape was such that local measurements assimilated by Kriging approaches had a limited spatial influence. Over scales \textgreater50 m, interpolation error was of similar magnitude to the error in the Landsat NDVI calibration. The characterisation of LAI spatial error in this study is a key step towards developing spatio-temporal data assimilation systems for assessing C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems by combining models with field and remotely sensed data. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:41:04","2022-10-11T14:41:04Z",NA,"1517–1530","","7",14,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Arctic; Data assimilation; Geostatistics; Kriging; LAI; Landsat; NDVI; Remote sensing; Semivariogram; Tundra","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The estimations are based on the use of inverse modeling methods enabling combination of the data for tropospheric NO2 column amounts derived from the long-term (1996-2008) GOME and SCIAMACHY satellite measurements with simulations performed by the CHIMERE chemistry transport model. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:41:03","2022-10-11T14:41:03Z",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"Springer","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1007/978-90-481-9618-0",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Purported relationships describe the initial state of knowledge, but are rarely tested. We assessed support in the data for suitability rankings of vegetation types based on expert knowledge for three terrestrial avian species in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States. Experts used published studies, natural history, survey data, and field experience to rank vegetation types as optimal, suitable, and marginal. We used single-season occupancy models, coupled with land cover and Breeding Bird Survey data, to examine the hypothesis that patterns of occupancy conformed to species-habitat suitability rankings purported by experts. Purported habitat suitability was validated for two of three species. As predicted for the Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens) and Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla), occupancy was strongly influenced by vegetation types classified as “optimal habitat” by the species suitability rankings for nuthatches and wood-pewees. Contrary to predictions, Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) models that included vegetation types as covariates received similar support by the data as models without vegetation types. For all three species, occupancy was also related to sampling latitude. Our results suggest that covariates representing other habitat requirements might be necessary to model occurrence of generalist species like the woodpecker.

They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells.

Failure to anticipate problems before they escalate results in the need for more costly and time-consuming solutions. Proactive conservation requires forward-looking approaches to decision making that consider possible futures without being overly constrained by the past. Strategic foresight provides a structured process for considering the most desirable future and for mapping the most efficient and effective approaches to promoting that future with tools that facilitate creative thinking. The process involves 6 steps: setting the scope, collecting inputs, analyzing signals, interpreting the information, determining how to act, and implementing the outcomes. Strategic foresight is ideal for seeking, recognizing, and realizing conservation opportunities because it explicitly encourages a broad-minded, forward-looking perspective on an issue. Despite its potential value, the foresight process is rarely used to address conservation issues, and previous attempts have generally failed to influence policy. We present the strategic foresight process as it can be used for proactive conservation planning, describing some of the key tools in the foresight tool kit and how they can be used to identify and exploit different types of conservation opportunities. Scanning is an important tool for collecting and organizing diverse streams of information and can be used to recognize new opportunities and those that could be created. Scenario planning explores how current trends, drivers of change, and key uncertainties might influence the future and can be used to identify barriers to opportunities. Backcasting is used to map out a path to a goal and can determine how to remove barriers to opportunities. We highlight how the foresight process was used to identify conservation opportunities during the development of a strategic plan to address climate change in New York State. The plan identified solutions that should be effective across a range of possible futures. Illustrating the application of strategic foresight to identify conservation opportunities should provide the impetus for decision makers to explore strategic foresight as a way to support more proactive conservation policy, planning, and management. Uso de la Prevision Estrategica para Evaluar Oportunidades de Conservacion Cook, Wintle & Aldrich La naturaleza de los obstaculos para la conservacion puede albergar una estrategia reactiva, en lugar de una proactiva, para la toma de decisiones. Fallar en la anticipacion a problemas antes de que escalen resulta en la necesidad de soluciones mas costosas y que consumen mucho tiempo. La conservacion proactiva requiere estrategias con miras al futuro para la toma de decisiones que consideren futuros posibles sin estar muy restringidas por el pasado. La prevision estrategica proporciona un proceso estructurado para considerar el futuro mas deseable y para mapear las estrategias mas eficientes y efectivas para promover ese futuro con herramientas que faciliten el pensamiento creativo. El proceso involucra seis pasos: establecer el alcance, colectar aportaciones, analizar senales, interpretar la informacion, determinar como actuar e implementar los resultados. La prevision estrategica es ideal para buscar, reconocer y llevar a cabo oportunidades de conservacion ya que estimula explicitamente una perspectiva de mente abierta y con miras al futuro sobre algun tema. A pesar de su valor potencial, el proceso de prevision rara vez se usa para dirigirse a asuntos de conservacion, y en intentos previos han fallado generalmente en influenciar a la politica. Presentamos el proceso de prevision estrategica ya que puede usarse para la planeacion proactiva de la conservacion, para describir algunas de las herramientas clave en el juego de herramientas de la prevision y como pueden usarse para identificar y explotar diferentes tipos de oportunidades de conservacion. El escaneo es una herramienta importante para colectar y organizar diversas series de informacion y puede usarse para reconocer nuevas oportunidades y aquellas que podrian surgir. La planeacion de escenarios explora como las tendencias actuales, los conductores del cambio y las incertidumbres clave pueden influenciar al futuro y tambien puede usarse para identificar barreras que bloqueen a las oportunidades. Definir un futuro deseable y despues identificar politicas y programas que conecten al presente con el pasado se usa para mapear un camino hacia una meta y puede determinar como remover las barreras que bloqueen a las oportunidades.

Hydrology and nutrient loads are, in turn, influenced by socio-economic factors such as human habitation, water abstraction and land-management, within their catchments. Models provide a means of linking these different domains and also of forecasting and evaluating the effects of different management scenarios on lakes. This paper describes the application of such models to Loweswater, a well-studied lake with water quality problems in the English Lake District, where a community-based approach to catchment management is being undertaken.Three models were linked. Firstly, PLANET (Planning Land Applications of Nutrients for Efficiency and the environmenT), an 'off the shelf' farm nutrient budgeting model, was supplemented by local information on septic tanks and used to produce an annual nutrient load to the lake. Secondly, GWLF (Generalized Watershed Loading Function), a generic nutrient runoff model, was used to generate daily nutrient runoff values using input from PLANET plus additional information on land-cover, air temperature and rainfall within the catchment. Thirdly PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange), driven by input from GWLF and locally measured meteorology, was used to forecast the abundance of different algal types within the lake. The linked models were used to describe the current impact of catchment management on lake water quality, validated by . in situ measurements, and to explore the potential impact of a number of alternative catchment management scenarios. Issues surrounding the use of generic modelling applications for catchment management and relevance for stakeholders living in and/or managing land within the catchment are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:41:01","2022-10-11T14:41:01Z",NA,"64–75","","",36,NA,NA,"Using models to bridge the gap between land use an",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Catchment; Expert opinion; Farming; Modelling; Water quality","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecological models are currently one of the strongest approaches used to predicting and understanding the consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes in the natural environment. We assess the most commonly used capabilities of the modelling community to provide information about indicators outlined in the MSFD, particularly on biodiversity, food webs, non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity descriptors. We built a catalogue of models and their derived indicators to assess which models were able to demonstrate: (1) the linkages between indicators and ecosystem structure and function and (2) the impact of pressures on ecosystem state through indicators. Our survey identified 44 ecological models being implemented in Europe, with a high prevalence of those that focus on links between hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry, followed by end-to-end, species distribution/habitat suitability, bio-optical (remote sensing) and multispecies models. Approximately 200 indicators could be derived from these models, the majority of which were biomass and physical/hydrological/chemical indicators. Biodiversity and food webs descriptors, with ∼49% and ∼43% respectively, were better addressed in the reviewed modelling approaches than the non-indigenous species (0.3%) and sea floor integrity (∼8%) descriptors. Out of 12 criteria and 21 MSFD indicators relevant to the abovementioned descriptors, currently only three indicators were not addressed by the 44 models reviewed. Modelling approaches showed also the potential to inform on the complex, integrative ecosystem dimensions while addressing ecosystem fundamental properties, such as interactions between structural components and ecosystems services provided, despite the fact that they are not part of the MSFD indicators set. The cataloguing of models and their derived indicators presented in this study, aim at helping the planning and integration of policies like the MSFD which require the assessment of all European Seas in relation to their ecosystem status and pressures associated and the establishment of environmental targets (through the use of indicators) to achieve GEnS by 2020.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:41:01","2022-10-11T14:41:01Z",NA,"175–191","","",58,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity descriptors; Ecological models; Habitats; MSFD; Marine ecosystems; Model-derived indicators; Pressures","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we show, on the basis of meta-analysis of available experimental assessments, differences in organism responses to elevated pCO2 and propose that marine biota may be more resistant to ocean acidification than expected. Calcification is most sensitive to ocean acidification while it is questionable if marine functional diversity is impacted significantly along the ranges of acidification predicted for the 21st century.

However, analysis of the social, economic and environmental impacts of community forestry is often limited, restricted to a narrow set of benefits (e.g. non-timber forest products) and rarely makes comparisons with alternative land-use options (e.g. agriculture). This study, conducted at Phulchoki Mountain Forest Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) in the Kathmandu Valley, used methods from the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) to compare multiple ecosystem service values (including carbon storage, greenhouse gas sequestration, water provision, water quality, harvested wild goods, cultivated goods and nature-based recreation) provided by the site in its current state and a plausible alternative state in which community forestry had not been implemented. We found that outcomes from community forestry have been favourable for most stakeholders, at most scales, for most services and for important biodiversity at the site. However, not all ecosystem services can be maximised simultaneously, and impacts of land-use decisions on service beneficiaries appear to differ according to socio-economic factors. The policy implications of our findings are discussed in the context of proposals to designate Phulchoki Mountain Forest IBA as part of a Conservation Area. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:41:00","2022-10-11T14:41:00Z",NA,"118–127","","",8,NA,NA,"What benefits do community forests provide, and to",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Beneficiaries; Biodiversity conservation; Community forestry; Equity; Livelihoods; Participatory management","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If clear relationships can be established between body size and trophic level in fishes, they may provide a basis for integrating community and ecosystem analyses based on size spectra, food webs and life histories. 3. We investigated relationships between the body sizes (weight and length) of northeast Atlantic fishes and their trophic level. The abundance of N-15, as determined by stable isotope analysis, was used as an index of trophic level. 4. Cross- species and comparative analyses demonstrated that body size was unrelated or weakly related to trophic level. Thus allometric relationships between body size and trophic level could not be used to predict the trophic structure of fish communities. 5. The results of the cross-species analyses contrasted with patterns in the size and trophic structure of entire fish communities. When fish communities were divided into size classes, there were strong positive relationships between size class and trophic level.

Portions of the framework were applied to build consensus on the focal ecosystem components and processes that are characteristic of a sustainable South Florida coastal ecosystem that is producing ecosystem services at the level society desires. Consensus was developed through facilitated meetings that aimed to conceptualize the ecosystem, develop ecosystem indicators, and conduct risk analysis. Resource managers, researchers, academics, and non-governmental organizations participated in these meetings and contributed to the synthesis of science and a myriad of science communications to transfer information to decision makers and the public.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to explain and predict species ranges and environmental niches. They are most commonly constructed by inferring species' occurrence-environment relationships using statistical and machine-learning methods. The variety of methods that can be used to construct SDMs (e.g. generalized linear/additive models, tree-based models, maximum entropy, etc.), and the variety of ways that such models can be implemented, permits substantial flexibility in SDM complexity. Building models with an appropriate amount of complexity for the study objectives is critical for robust inference. We characterize complexity as the shape of the inferred occurrence-environment relationships and the number of parameters used to describe them, and search for insights into whether additional complexity is informative or superfluous. By building 'under fit' models, having insufficient flexibility to describe observed occurrence-environment relationships, we risk misunderstanding the factors shaping species distributions. By building 'over fit' models, with excessive flexibility, we risk inadvertently ascribing pattern to noise or building opaque models. However, model selection can be challenging, especially when comparing models constructed under different modeling approaches. Here we argue for a more pragmatic approach: researchers should constrain the complexity of their models based on study objective, attributes of the data, and an understanding of how these interact with the underlying biological processes. We discuss guidelines for balancing under fitting with over fitting and consequently how complexity affects decisions made during model building. Although some generalities are possible, our discussion reflects differences in opinions that favor simpler versus more complex models. We conclude that combining insights from both simple and complex SDM building approaches best advances our knowledge of current and future species ranges.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:59","2022-10-11T14:40:59Z",NA,"1267–1281","","12",37,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article illustrates how the tools of multiattribute analysis can improve management of invasive species, with an emphasis on making explicit the social values and preferences that must inform invasive species management. Risk assessment protocols developed previously for invasive species management typically suffer from two interacting flaws: (1) separating risk assessment from risk management, thus disrupting essential connections between the social values at stake in invasive species decisions and the scientific knowledge necessary to predict the likely impacts of management actions, and (2) relying on expert judgment about risk framed in qualitative and value-laden terms, inadvertently mixing the expert's judgment about what is likely to happen with personal preferences. Using the values structuring and probability-modeling elements of formal decision analysis can remedy these difficulties and make invasive species management responsive to both good science and public values.

Ecological predictive models used for this purpose are constructed using either a mechanistic (process-based) or a phenomenological (empirical) approach, or combination. Given the accelerating pace of global changes, it is becoming increasingly difficult to trust future projections made by phenomenological models estimated under past conditions. Using forest landscape models as an example, I review current modeling approaches and propose principles for developing the next generation of landscape models. First, modelers should increase the use of mechanistic components based on appro- priately scaled ‘‘first principles” even though such an approach is not without cost and limitations. Second, the interaction of processes within a model should be designed to minimize a priori constraints on process interactions and mimic how interactions play out in real life. Third, when a model is expected to make accurate projections of future system states it must include all of the major ecological processes that structure the system. A completely mechanistic approach to the molecular level is not tractable or desirable at landscape scales. I submit that the best solution is to blend mechanistic and phenomenolog- ical approaches in a way that maximizes the use of mechanisms where novel driver conditions are expected while keeping the model tractable. There may be other ways.

A variety of modelling approaches are used to transform point locations into maps. We discuss the attributes that point location data and distribution maps must satisfy in order to be useful in conservation planning. We recommend that before point location data are used to produce and/or evaluate distribution models, the dataset should be assessed under a set of criteria, including sample size, age of data, environmental/geographical coverage, independence, accuracy, time relevance and (often forgotten) representation of areas of permanent and natural presence of the species. Distribution maps must satisfy additional attributes if used for conservation analyses and strategies, including minimizing commission and omission errors, credibility of the source/assessors and availability for public screening.

The promise of adaptive management is that learning in the short-term will improve management in the long-term; that promise is best kept if the focus of learning is on those uncertainties that most impede achievement of management objectives. In this context, an existing tool of decision analysis, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), is particularly valuable in identifying the most important uncertainties. Expert elicitation can be used to develop preliminary predictions of management response under a series of hypotheses, as well as prior weights for those hypotheses, and the EVPI can be used to determine how much management could improve if uncertainty was resolved. These methods were applied to management of whooping cranes (Grus americana), an endangered migratory bird that is being reintroduced in several places in North America. The Eastern Migratory Population of whooping cranes had exhibited almost no successful reproduction through 2009. Several dozen hypotheses can be advanced to explain this failure, and many of them lead to very different management responses. An expert panel articulated the hypotheses, provided prior weights for them, developed potential management strategies, and made predictions about the response of the population to each strategy under each hypothesis. Multi-criteria decision analysis identified a preferred strategy in the face of uncertainty, and analysis of the expected value of information identified how informative each strategy could be. These results provide the foundation for design of an adaptive management program. © 2010.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:40:59","2022-10-11T14:40:59Z",NA,"1214–1223","","4",144,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Expected value of information; Expert elicitation; Grus americana; Whooping crane","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, most global environmental scenarios have treated ecological dynamics as the product of large-scale anthropogenic drivers and have not considered ecological feedbacks to these drivers. Global scenarios could benefit from the input of ecologists, as this would lead to the incorporation of more realistic ecosystem dynamics.

The normative and instrumental theoretical basis for stakeholder analysis is discussed, and a stakeholder analysis typology is proposed. This consists of methods for: i) identifying stakeholders; ii) differentiating between and categorising stakeholders; and iii) investigating relationships between stakeholders. The range of methods that can be used to carry out each type of analysis is reviewed. These methods and approaches are then illustrated through a series of case studies funded through the Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.

Here, we synthesize available data on the importance of wild food as ecosystem service, its spatial distribution and relations between supply, demand and benefits in the European Union (EU), covering all terrestrial wild food groups. A wide variety of game (38 species), mushrooms (27 species) and vascular plants (81 species) is collected and consumed throughout the EU. Income, age, gender, possibilities for collecting, and cultural factors explain the importance of wild food. While the economic and nutritional values of wild food comprise a few thousands of the GDP or total consumption, over 100. million EU citizens consume wild food. Collecting wild food is an appreciated recreational activity; collecting and consuming wild food provide important cultural ecosystem services, including recreation and sense of place. Because of these benefits, wild food should be included in EU ecosystem service assessments. Better estimates could be made if better data on wild food abundance and production are available and by systematic inventories of participation in wild food collecting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:57","2022-10-11T14:40:57Z",NA,"292–305","","",105,NA,NA,"Wild food in Europe: A synthesis of knowledge and",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem service; Game; Mapping; Wild berries; Wild edible plants; Wild mushrooms","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Realtime Environment for Analytical Processing (REAP) is an NSF-funded project to address the technical challenges related to accessing and using heterogeneous sensor data from within the Kepler scientific workflow system. Using distinct use cases in terrestrial ecology and oceanography as motivating examples, we describe workflows and extensions to Kepler to stream and analyze data from observatory networks and archives.

The authors outline research on the linguistic developmental trajectory for WS and show that it develops under different constraints from those of typical development.

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation",2015,"2022-10-11 14:40:56","2022-10-11T14:40:56Z",NA,"","91","",42,NA,NA,"",NA,"3-4",NA,NA,"Oxford University Press","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.25336/p6n319",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent improvements in LCIA focus on specific cause-effect chains, mainly related to land use changes, leading to Characterization Factors (CFs) at the midpoint assessment level. However, despite the complexity and temporal dynamics of ES, current LCIA approaches consider the environmental mechanisms underneath ES to be independent from each other and devoid of dynamic character, leading to constant CFs whose representativeness is debatable. This paper takes a step forward and is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of using an integrated earth system dynamic modeling perspective to retrieve time- and scenario-dependent CFs that consider the complex interlinkages between natural processes delivering ES. The GUMBO (Global Unified Metamodel of the Biosphere) model is used to quantify changes in ES production in physical terms - leading to midpoint CFs - and changes in human welfare indicators, which are considered here as endpoint CFs. The interpretation of the obtained results highlights the key methodological challenges to be solved to consider this approach as a robust alternative to the mainstream rationale currently adopted in LCIA. Further research should focus on increasing the granularity of environmental interventions in the modeling tools to match current standards in LCA and on adapting the conceptual approach to a spatially-explicit integrated model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:55","2022-10-11T14:40:55Z",NA,"262–272","","","472",NA,NA,"Integrated earth system dynamic modeling for life",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Dynamic modeling; Ecosystem Services (ES); Global Unified Metamodel of the Biosphere (GUMBO); Integrated modeling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The problems are characterized by the extent of the environmental system involved, dynamic and interdependent nature of stressors and their impacts, diversity of stakeholders, and integration of social, economic, and environmental considerations. IEM provides a science-based structure to develop and organize relevant knowledge and information and apply it to explain, explore, and predict the behavior of environmental systems in response to human and natural sources of stress. During the past several years a number of workshops were held that brought IEM practitioners together to share experiences and discuss future needs and directions. In this paper we organize and present the results of these discussions. IEM is presented as a landscape containing four interdependent elements: applications, science, technology, and community. The elements are described from the perspective of their role in the landscape, current practices, and challenges that must be addressed. Workshop participants envision a global scale IEM community that leverages modern technologies to streamline the movement of science-based knowledge from its sources in research, through its organization into databases and models, to its integration and application for problem solving purposes. Achieving this vision will require that the global community of IEM stakeholders transcend social, and organizational boundaries and pursue greater levels of collaboration. Among the highest priorities for community action are the development of standards for publishing IEM data and models in forms suitable for automated discovery, access, and integration; education of the next generation of environmental stakeholders, with a focus on transdisciplinary research, development, and decision making; and providing a web-based platform for community interactions (e.g., continuous virtual workshops). © 2012 .",2013,"2022-10-11 14:40:55","2022-10-11T14:40:55Z",NA,"3–23","","","39",NA,NA,"Integrated environmental modeling: a vision and ro",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Community of practice; Integrated environmental modeling; Model integration; Roadmap","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper uses a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model that incorporates these factors to project distribution and maximum catch potential of 120 species of exploited demersal fish and invertebrates in the Northeast Atlantic. Using projections from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (ESM2.1) under the SRES A1B, we project an average rate of distribution-centroid shift of 52 km decade−1 northwards and 5.1 m decade−1 deeper from 2005 to 2050. Ocean acidification and reduction in oxygen content reduce growth performance, increase the rate of range shift, and lower the estimated catch potentials (10-year average of 2050 relative to 2005) by 20–30% relative to simulations without considering these factors. Consideration of phytoplankton community structure may further reduce projected catch potentials by ∼10%.

Although Option #1 is the most common solution, in this essay I argue that careful articulation of the theories of change behind conservation strategies reveals that it is often the worst choice. Project teams ultimately have to select either conservation or development goals, or risk achieving neither, especially in cases in which there is minimal linkage between the goals. Instead, a far better choice is Option #2 under which conservation agencies and organizations use the resources allocated to them by society in service of strict conservation ends. Under this option, project teams cannot ignore development concerns. Instead, they need to consider human needs in the context of both the threats at the site and their strategies - to use development means to achieve their desired conservation ends. Finally, in situations in which conservation teams need to increase available resources, it may be useful to show how conservation ends can also be a means to help achieve broader development ends over the long-term. Under Option #3, creating a clear ""results chain"" showing the team's theory of change enables teams to explicitly explore and make use of the links between human and natural welfare needs, and provide appropriate authorities with the information needed to weigh tradeoffs and make required decisions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:40:55","2022-10-11T14:40:55Z",NA,"973–978","","3","144",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation; Integrated conservation and development; Project goal; Results chain; Social welfare; Tradeoffs","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, current modeling approaches$\backslash$nare poorly suited for the analysis of viability in dynamic landscapes.$\backslash$nDemographic (e.g., metapopulation) models of species living in these$\backslash$nlandscapes do not incorporate the variability in spatial patterns$\backslash$nof early successional habitats, and landscape models have not been$\backslash$nlinked to population viability models. We link a landscape model$\backslash$nto a metapopulation model and demonstrate the use of this model by$\backslash$nanalyzing the effect of forest management options on the viability$\backslash$nof the Sharp-tailed Grouse ( Tympanuchus phasianellus) in the Pine$\backslash$nBarrens region of northwestern Wisconsin (U.S.A.). This approach$\backslash$nallows viability analysis based on landscape dynamics brought about$\backslash$nby processes such as succession, disturbances, and silviculture.$\backslash$nThe landscape component of the model (LANDIS) predicts forest landscape$\backslash$ndynamics in the form of a time series of raster maps. We combined$\backslash$nthese maps into a time series of patch structures, which formed the$\backslash$ndynamic spatial structure of the metapopulation component (RAMAS).$\backslash$nOur results showed that the viability of Sharp-tailed Grouse was$\backslash$nsensitive to landscape dynamics and demographic variables such as$\backslash$nfecundity and mortality. Ignoring the landscape dynamics gave overly$\backslash$noptimistic results, and results based only on landscape dynamics$\backslash$n(ignoring demography) lead to a different ranking of the management$\backslash$noptions than the ranking based on the more realistic model incorporating$\backslash$nboth landscape and demographic dynamics. Thus, models of species$\backslash$nin dynamic landscapes must consider habitat and population dynamics$\backslash$nsimultaneously. Resumen:La falta de experiencia de gestión a nivel$\backslash$nde paisaje y la limitada factibilidad de experimentos a esta escala$\backslash$nhan incrementado el uso de modelos de escenarios para analizar los$\backslash$nefectos de diferentes acciones de gestión sobre especies locales.$\backslash$nSin embargo, los métodos de modelaje actuales son poco adecuados$\backslash$npara el análisis de viabilidad en paisajes dinámicos.

These modelling disciplines are largely practiced separately, with separate literature, despite growing evidence that natural systems are shaped by the interaction of composition and function. Here we call for the development of new modelling approaches that integrate composition and function, accounting for the important interactions between these two dimensions, particularly under rapid global change. We examine existing modelling approaches that have begun to combine elements of composition and function, identifying their potential contribution to fully integrated modelling approaches. The development and application of integrated models of composition and function face a number of important challenges, including biological data limitations, system knowledge and computational constraints. We suggest a range of promising avenues that could help researchers overcome these challenges, including the use of virtual species, macro-ecological relationships and hybrid correlative-mechanistic modelling.

Addressing more localised impacts requires that new integrated modelling approaches are developed to address fine-scale processes including species' dispersal and local connectivity. Here we integrate four models (a continental scale bioclimatic envelope model, a regional scale bioclimate and land use suitability model, a dispersal model, and a connectivity model) in a scale-dependent hierarchical framework. The approach has been used to analyse the fine scale impacts of climate change on species' distributions within two contrasting case study regions located in East Anglia (UK) and Almeria (Spain). Eight and six species respectively were used to test our approach under three climate change scenarios. Despite the uncertainties inherent in the modelling approach, our analyses suggest two general conclusions: (i) climate change involves the development of transient conditions and fragmentation within the core of species distributions; (ii) climate change would favour the opening of gaps within the current vegetation zones, rather than a simple zonal shift of them. Dynamic and integrated conservation policies are required, that take account of the current and potential future spatial arrangement of species and their habitats, to assist species to respond to future environmental change. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Examples of cross-scale pattern-process relationships and interactions among forest dieback, fire, and erosion are illustrated from northern New Mexico (USA) landscapes, where long-term studies have recently documented all of these disturbance processes. For example, environmental stress, operating on individual trees, can cause tree death that is amplified by insect mortality agents to propagate to patch and then landscape or even regional-scale forest dieback. Severe drought and unusual warmth in the southwestern USA since the late 1990s apparently exceeded species-specific physiological thresholds for multiple tree species, resulting in substantial vegetation mortality across millions of hectares of woodlands and forests in recent years. Predictions of forest dieback across spatial scales are constrained by uncertainties associated with: limited knowledge of species-specific physiological thresholds; individual and site-specific variation in these mortality thresholds; and positive feedback loops between rapidly-responding insect herbivore populations and their stressed plant hosts, sometimes resulting in nonlinear “pest” outbreak dynamics. Fire behavior also exhibits nonlinearities across spatial scales, illustrated by changes in historic fire regimes where patch-scale grazing disturbance led to regional-scale collapse of surface fire activity and subsequent recent increases in the scale of extreme fire events in New Mexico. Vegetation dieback interacts with fire activity by modifying fuel amounts and configurations at multiple spatial scales. Runoff and erosion processes are also subject to scale-dependent threshold behaviors, exemplified by ecohydrological work in semiarid New Mexico watersheds showing how declines in ground surface cover lead to non-linear increases in bare patch connectivity and thereby accelerated runoff and erosion at hillslope and watershed scales. Vegetation dieback, grazing, and fire can change land surface properties and cross-scale hydrologic connectivities, directly altering ecohydrological patterns of runoff and erosion. The interactions among disturbance processes across spatial scales can be key drivers in ecosystem dynamics, as illustrated by these studies of recent landscape changes in northern New Mexico. To better anticipate and mitigate accelerating human impacts to the planetary ecosystem at all spatial scales, improvements are needed in our conceptual and quantitative understanding of cross-scale interactions among disturbance processes.",2007,"2022-10-11 14:40:53","2022-10-11T14:40:53Z",NA,"797–808","","5","10",NA,NA,"Interactions across spatial scales among forest di",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cross-scale relationships; Disturbance interactions; Erosion; Fire; Fire history; Forest dieback; New Mexico; Southwestern USA; Thresholds","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Multicriteria Analysis combines the model outputs with socioeconomic values for the coast and through assignment of different weights/priorities by the user provides a ranking system for these scenarios. The Gulf of Gera, Island of Lesvos, Greece, a semi-enclosed and shallow system surrounded by a cultivated and inhabited watershed, was used as a case study for this method. Four scenarios concerning the development of tourism, the construction of agricultural greenhouses, the cultivation of woody plant species and the development of animal husbandry were tested against the present condition of the watershed (which is primarily dominated by olive oil production). The trade-off between increased profits and environmental impacts for these development scenarios was illustrated using Cluster and Principal Component Analysis. The results of these analyses showed that tourism and animal husbandry balance profits and environmental degradation most effectively and represent the most favorable future development strategies for the study area.

A new top predator, the dragonfly Cordulegaster boltonii Donovan, 'invaded' a stream with a well-described food web. 2. The pre-invasion web was species-poor but complex, with prevalent intraguild predation, cannibalism and omnivory. Such characteristics differ from expectations based upon the early food web literature, but are consistent with more recent empirical webs and theoretical developments. 3. Exhaustive sampling was necessary to describe web structure, with the gut contents of several hundred individuals being required to reach the asymptote of the total number of links for individual species. There was no single 'standard' sample size that was applicable for estimating the number of links: sampling 'x' guts gave a different fraction of the asymptotic value for different species. Smaller predators were more prone to underestimation of links than larger species higher in the web. 4. The number of feeding links, trophic status and the degree of omnivory increased progressively with predator body size, both within and among species. The diet of each predator species (or instar) was effectively a subset of the diet of the next largest predator. 5. The invader was extremely polyphagous and fed at all trophic levels. Mean chain length increased by half a link following the invasion. Web complexity, and omnivory in particular, also increased. Pre- and post-invasion webs displayed intervality and rigid circuitry. The resident predators were frequently eaten by the invader, but the only significant predators of C. boltonii were larger conspecifics. Although no species have yet been deleted, there has been a 21% increase in links for a 6% increase in species since the invasion, suggesting that the members of the web had become more tightly packed within niche space. Most prey species were eaten by every predator species (including C. boltonii), indicating the potential for strong apparent competition within the web.",2001,"2022-10-11 14:40:52","2022-10-11T14:40:52Z",NA,"273–288","","2","70",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Connectance; Intraguild predation; Niche overlap; Omnivory; Ontogenetic diet shifts","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The core concept in adaptive management is that policy choices should be treated as deliberate, large-scale experiments; hence, policy choice should be treated at least partly as a problem of scientific experimental design. There have now been upwards of 100 case studies where attempts were made to apply adaptive management to issues ranging from restoration of endangered desert fish species to protection of the Great Barrier Reef. Most of these cases have been failures in the sense that no experimental management program was ever implemented, and there have been serious problems with monitoring programs in the handful of cases where an experimental plan was implemented. Most of the failures can be traced to three main institutional problems: i) lack of management resources for the expanded monitoring needed to carry out large-scale experiments; ii) unwillingness by decision makers to admit and embrace uncertainty in making policy choices; and iii) lack of leadership in the form of individuals willing to do all the hard work needed to plan and implement new and complex management programs.",2007,"2022-10-11 14:40:50","2022-10-11T14:40:50Z",NA,"304–7","","4","36",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 17626467",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detec- tion and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conserva- tion applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simula- tions reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes.

Selecting the correct scale of measurement is essential to appropriately assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on bird occurrence. Our objective was to determine which spatial scale of landscape measurement best describes the incidence of three bird species (Pyriglena leucoptera, Xiphorhynchus fuscus and Chiroxiphia caudata) in the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest and test if multi-scalar models perform better than single-scalar ones. Bird incidence was assessed in 80 forest fragments. The surrounding landscape structure was described with four indices measured at four spatial scales (400-, 600-, 800- and 1,000-m buffers around the sample points). The explanatory power of each scale in predicting bird incidence was assessed using logistic regression, bootstrapped with 1,000 repetitions. The best results varied between species (1,000-m radius for P. leucoptera; 800-m for X. fuscus and 600-m for C. caudata), probably due to their distinct feeding habits and foraging strategies. Multi-scale models always resulted in better predictions than single-scale models, suggesting that different aspects of the landscape structure are related to different ecological processes influencing bird incidence. In particular, our results suggest that local extinction and (re)colonisation processes might simultaneously act at different scales. Thus, single-scale models may not be good enough to properly describe complex pattern-process relationships. Selecting variables at multiple ecologically relevant scales is a reasonable procedure to optimise the accuracy of species incidence models.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:40:50","2022-10-11T14:40:50Z",NA,"907–918","","7","24",NA,NA,"Is bird incidence in Atlantic forest fragments inf",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"AUC; Atlantic plateau; Brazil; Chiroxiphia caudata; Fragmentation; Incidence; Landscape structure; Pyriglena leucoptera; Spatial scale; São Paulo; Xiphorhynchus fuscus","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study evaluates different land management scenarios in terms of ecosystem services in a South African rangeland, the Baviaanskloof catchment. As measured data were limited, we used simple models to quantify and map the effect of the different combination of agricultural, nature conservation and restoration practices on multiple ecosystem services. The land management scenarios were evaluated against management targets set for individual ecosystem services. Results highlight how the provision of ecosystem services is related to land management as unmanaged, pristine ecosystems provide a different mix of ecosystem services than ecosystems recently restored or managed as grazing lands. Results also indicate that historically overgrazed lands provide no forage, may retain 40% less sediment and have 38% lower biodiversity, while providing 60% more fuel wood and supplying two and half times more water (i.e. retaining less water), than pristine or restored lands. We conclude that a combination of light grazing, low input agriculture, nature conservation and restoration is the best for the sufficient provision of multiple ecosystem services. Applying such mixed management would improve biodiversity, ecotourism and maintain forage production and regulating services on farmers' land. This management option also fits into and further optimizes local decision-makers' vision regarding the future management of the area. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:49","2022-10-11T14:40:49Z",NA,"692–703","","","45",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem degradation; Environmental decision-making; GIS; Mapping; Scenario; Thicket restoration","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The CLUMondo model provides an innovative approach for global land-use change modeling to support integrated assessments. Demands for goods and services are, in the model, supplied by a variety of land systems that are characterized by their land cover mosaic, the agricultural management intensity, and livestock. Land system changes are simulated by the model, driven by regional demand for goods and influenced by local factors that either constrain or promote land system conversion. A characteristic of the new model is the endogenous simulation of intensification of agricultural management versus expansion of arable land, and urban versus rural settlements expansion based on land availability in the neighborhood of the location. Model results for the OECD Environmental Outlook scenario show that allocation of increased agricultural production by either management intensification or area expansion varies both among and within world regions, providing useful insight into the land sparing versus land sharing debate. The land system approach allows the inclusion of different types of demand for goods and services from the land system as a driving factor of land system change.

Since the formalisation of problem-specific human expert knowledge is often difficult and tedious, data-driven machine learning techniques may be helpful to extract knowledge from ecological datasets. In this paper, both expert knowledge-based and data-driven fuzzy habitat suitability models were developed and the performance of these models was compared. For the data-driven models, a hill-climbing optimisation algorithm was applied to derive ecological knowledge from the available data. Based on the available ecological expert knowledge and on biological samples from the Zwalm river basin (Belgium), habitat suitability models were generated for the mayfly Baetis rhodani (Pictet 1843). Data-driven models appeared to outperform expert knowledge-based models substantially, while a step-forward model selection procedure indicated that physical habitat variables adequately described the mayfly habitat suitability in the studied area. This study has important implications on the application of expert knowledge in ecological studies, especially if this knowledge is extrapolated to other areas. The results suggest that data-driven models can complement expert knowledge-based approaches and hence improve model reliability. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:40:49","2022-10-11T14:40:49Z",NA,"982–993","","8","24",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Decision support systems; Ecological modelling; Expert knowledge; Fuzzy logic; Hill-climbing; Integrated river basin management; Macroinvertebrates; Physical habitat; Stream","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Structures and functions of ecosystems needed to sustain the provision of ecosystem services are altered by various human activities. In this paper, a concept for the assessment of multiple ecosystem services is proposed as a basis for discussion and further development of a respective evaluation instrument. Using quantitative and qualitative assessment data in combination with land cover and land use information originated from remote sensing and GIS, impacts of human activities can be evaluated. The results reveal typical patterns of different ecosystems' capacities to provide ecosystem services. The proposed approach thus delivers useful integrative information for environmental management and landscape planning, aiming at a sustainable use of services provided by nature. The research concept and methodological framework presented here for discussion have initially been applied in different case studies and shall be developed further to provide a useful tool for the quantification and spatial modelling of multiple ecosystem services in different landscapes. An exemplary application of the approach dealing with food provision in the Halle-Leipzig region in Germany is presented. It shows typical patterns of ecosystem service distribution around urban areas. As the approach is new and still rather general, there is great potential for improvement, especially with regard to a data-based quantification of the numerous hypotheses, which were formulated as base for the assessment. Moreover, the integration of more detailed landscape information on different scales will be needed in future in order to take the heterogeneous distribution of landscape properties and values into account. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to foster critical discussions on the methodological development presented here. © 2009 IALE-D.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:40:48","2022-10-11T14:40:48Z",NA,"1–22","","1","15",NA,NA,"Landscapes‘ Capacities to Provide Ecosystem Servic",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Corine land cover; Ecosystem integrity; Ecosystem services; Indicators; Land use","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Catalonia (NE Spain) some fires have been locally associated with the expansion of the large, evergreen, resprouting tussock grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica. We tested the hypothesis of a positive feedback between the abundance of A. mauritanica and changing fire regimes. We used permanent plots distributed across a natural gradient of density of A. mauritanica in the Garraf Natural Park near Barcelona. Total aboveground biomass nearly doubled from plots with low to high density through a combination o f A. mauritanica replacing the biomass of other components of the community (predominantly native shrubs), and its absolute standing biomass increasing. The quantity of litter also increased. This increase in fuel load and changes in community functional composition resulted from the simultaneous decrease in shrub productivity and an increase in litter accumulation. Litter accumulation was the consequence of A. mauritanica litter decomposing 30% more slowly than that of shrubs. Under standardized conditions, A. mauritanica and its litter were considerably more flammable than any of the shrub species. This resulted in a more than 40-fold increase in calculated plot flammability from low-to-high-density plots. Feedbacks, at the landscape scale, were then analysed using the landscape simulation platform LAMOS. Invasion success and contribution to community biomass of A. mauritanica increased with decreasing fire return intervals. Total area burnt in the landscape during each fire year was positively and exponentially related to the total biomass of A. mauritanica. Simulations showed that landscapes can abruptly switch from regimes of small localized to extensive fires as a result of the spread of A. mauritanica. Therefore, increases in fires under climate change represent threats not only through their direct impacts on ecosystems, but also by promoting invaders such as A. mauritanica, which have the potential to induce powerful feedforward processes and, thereby, fundamental changes to ecosystems. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:40:48","2022-10-11T14:40:48Z",NA,"1042–1053","","7","11",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Ecosystem function; Fire; Functional diversity; Invasion; Land use change; Landscape model; Mediterranean shrubland","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In many places in Europe, trees are currently far below their theoretical altitudinal limit because of past land use. However, under the current crisis affecting mountain agriculture, trees are likely to recolonize the subalpine belt. Addressing the societal issues associated with such landscape change requires predictive tools to assess vegetation dynamics in relation to management strategies. This study aims to analyse the factors determining tree dynamics at the subalpine ecotone and to evaluate the impact of land-use change on landscape vegetation patterns. 2. We developed a hierarchical scaling approach and applied it to a European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) colonization in the French Alps. Our landscape case study focused on subalpine south-facing grasslands of Villar d'Arêne (France). First, we used a habitat-suitability model to delineate the climatic suitability habitats of larch in the French Alps. Then we used a landscape model (LaMoS) to determine whether larch is able to colonize these grasslands predicted to be climatically suitable, considering land use and local vegetation. The sensitivity of landscape colonization patterns to land-use scenarios (abandonment, delayed mowing or traditional mowing) and biological attributes of larch were analysed with a factorial simulation experiment. 3. The accuracy of the habitat-suitability model at the French Alps scale allowed for the prediction that the grasslands of Villar d'Arêne were highly suitable for larch. 4. Simulations highlighted the effect of land use on larch establishment at the local but not at the landscape scale. On the other hand, larch attributes such as dispersal capacity, juvenile tolerance to light interaction (competition and facilitation) and its capacity to survive on infertile soil were shown as essential for tree spatial dynamics. 5. Synthesis and applications . Combining a habitat-suitability model with a spatially and temporally explicit landscape model enhances the capacity to account for environmental factors acting at different overlapping scales. This modelling strategy increases the robustness and accuracy of predictions, a prerequisite for landscape management in a global change context. We conclude that ongoing and future agri-environmental policies have to be quickly adapted to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by subalpine grasslands.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:40:48","2022-10-11T14:40:48Z",NA,"659–669","","2","45",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate; Habitat-suitability modelling; Landscape dynamics model; Landscape management; Mowing","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Attempts to model exploited marine ecosystems can increase understanding of system dynamics; identify major processes, drivers and responses; highlight major gaps in knowledge; and provide a mechanism to 'road test' management strategies before implementing them in reality. The Atlantis modelling framework has been used in these roles for a decade and is regularly being modified and applied to new questions (e.g. it is being coupled to climate, biophysical and economic models to help consider climate change impacts, monitoring schemes and multiple use management). This study describes some common lessons learned from its implementation, particularly in regard to when these tools are most effective and the likely form of best practices for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Most importantly, it highlighted that no single management lever is sufficient to address the many trade-offs associated with EBM and that the mix of measures needed to successfully implement EBM will differ between systems and will change through time. Although it is doubtful that any single management action will be based solely on Atlantis, this modelling approach continues to provide important insights for managers when making natural resource management decisions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:40:47","2022-10-11T14:40:47Z",NA,"171–188","","2","12",NA,NA,"Lessons in modelling and management of marine ecos",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Atlantis; Ecosystem modelling; Ecosystem-based management; Exploited marine ecosystems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, these strategies may overlook areas where many species have biological traits that make them particularly sensitive to future human impact but are not yet threatened because such impact is currently low. In this article, we identify such areas for the world's mammals using latent extinction risk, the discrepancy between a species' current extinction risk and that predicted from models on the basis of biological traits. Species with positive latent risk are currently less threatened than their biology would suggest, usually because they inhabit regions or habitats still comparatively unmodified by human activity. Using large new geographic, biological, and phylogenetic databases for nearly 4,000 mammal species, we map the global geographic distribution of latent risk to reveal areas where the mammal fauna is still relatively unthreatened but has high inherent sensitivity to disturbance. These hotspots include large areas such as the Nearctic boreal forests and tundra that are unrepresented in most current prioritization schemes, as well as high-biodiversity areas such as the island arc from Indonesia to the south Pacific. Incorporating latent extinction risk patterns into conservation planning could help guard against future biodiversity loss by anticipating and preventing species declines before they begin.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:40:47","2022-10-11T14:40:47Z",NA,"4157–4161","","11","103",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we argue that explicitly linked sets of indicators offer a more useful framework than do individual indicators because the former are easier to understand, communicate and interpret to guide policy. A Response-Pressure-State-Benefit framework for structuring and linking indicators facilitates an understanding of the relationships between policy actions, anthropogenic threats, the status of biodiversity and the benefits that people derive from it. Such an approach is appropriate at global, regional, national and local scales but for many systems it is easier to demonstrate causal linkages and use them to aid decision making at national and local scales.

Several new assessment approaches have been proposed for evaluating the vulnerability of species to climate change based on the expectation that established assessments such as the IUCN Red List need revising or superseding in light of the threat that climate change brings. However, although previous studies have identified ecological and life history attributes that characterize declining species or those listed as threatened, no study so far has undertaken a quantitative analysis of the attributes that cause species to be at high risk of extinction specifically due to climate change. We developed a simulation approach based on generic life history types to show here that extinction risk due to climate change can be predicted using a mixture of spatial and demographic variables that can be measured in the present day without the need for complex forecasting models. Most of the variables we found to be important for predicting extinction risk, including occupied area and population size, are already used in species conservation assessments, indicating that present systems may be better able to identify species vulnerable to climate change than previously thought. Therefore, although climate change brings many new conservation challenges, we find that it may not be fundamentally different from other threats in terms of assessing extinction risks. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:46","2022-10-11T14:40:46Z",NA,"217–221","","3","4",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Gene flow across environments has two conflicting effects: although it increases genetic variation, which is a prerequisite for adaptation, gene flow may swamp adaptation to local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that, when the environment varies across space, ""swamping"" by gene flow creates a positive feedback between low population size and maladaptation, leading to a sharp range margin. However, current deterministic theory shows that, when variance can evolve, there is no such limit. Using simple analytical tools and simulations, we show that genetic drift can generate a sharp margin to a species' range, by reducing genetic variance below the level needed for adaptation to spatially variable conditions. Aided by separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales, the identified effective dimensionless parameters reveal a simple threshold that predicts when adaptation at the range margin fails. Two observable parameters determine the threshold: (i) the effective environmental gradient, which can be measured by the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment; and (ii) the efficacy of selection relative to genetic drift.

The Little Karoo, an arid environment in South Africa that encompasses a remarkable diversity of plant species, has been degraded by inappropriate agricultural practices, mainly overgrazing, cultivation, and irrigation. Landscape linkages, such as hydrological flows and the recycling of organic matter and nutrients, have been disrupted, resulting in net losses at all scales, from the shrub patch to the river basin.

Decision-makers need credible and legitimate measurements of ecosystem services to evaluate decisions for trade-offs to make wise choices. Managers lack these measurements because of a data gap linking ecosystem characteristics to final ecosystem services. The dominant method to address the data gap is benefit transfer using ecological data from one location to estimate ecosystem services at other locations with similar land cover. However, benefit transfer is only valid once the data gap is adequately resolved. Disciplinary frames separating ecology from economics and policy have resulted in confusion on concepts and methods preventing progress on the data gap. In this study, we present a 10-step approach to unify concepts, methods and data from the disparate disciplines to offer guidance on overcoming the data gap. We suggest: (1) estimate ecosystem characteristics using biophysical models, (2) identify final ecosystem services using endpoints and (3) connect them using ecological production functions to quantify biophysical trade-offs.

We describe the multiple biophysical and economic pathways that link actions to changes in water quality-related ecosystem goods and services and provide guidance to researchers interested in valuing these changes.

This paper demonstrates the potential use of a highly participatory scenario development framework that involves a mix of qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative methods. The assumption is that the use of semi-quantitative methods will structure the participatory output, which provides a solid base for quantification. It should further facilitate the communication between stakeholders and modellers. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps is the main semi-quantitative method and has a central place in the proposed framework. The paper provides a detailed description of its implementation in participatory workshops, also because of a lack of documented testing of its implementation. We tested Fuzzy Cognitive Maps as part of the framework in two training sessions; both gave encouraging results. Results show that the tool provides a structured, semi-quantitative understanding of the system perceptions of a group of participants. Participants perceived the method as easy to understand and easy to use in a short period of time. This supports the hypothesis that Fuzzy Cognitive Maps can be used as part of a scenario development framework and that the new framework can help to bridge the gap between storylines and models. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Commonly, scenario exercises have focussed on processes at one specific geographic scale. Recently scenario-based approaches have also been used to address multi-scale processes or to link scenarios developed at various geographical scales with each other in order to better understand the interaction of processes across scales. The level of interconnectedness across scales will vary, and depends largely on the approaches used to develop multi-scale scenarios. We distinguish five levels of interconnectedness scenarios may display across scales: (a) Equivalent, (b) Consistent, (c) Coherent, (d) Comparable, and (e) Complementary. Furthermore, we describe five different types of coupled scenario development processes: (a) Joint, (b) Parallel, (c) Iterative, (d) Consecutive, and (e) Independent. Based on this nomenclature, the relationship between the level of interconnectedness of scenarios and the degree of coupling of scenario development processes across geographical scales is discussed. Which process is best suited and how much interconnectedness is needed, will depend both on the focal issue and the primary purpose of the scenario exercise, i.e. whether the aim is education, scientific exploration, or decision-support. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Protection from fishing contributed to the overall increase in the mean annual rate of change as the coral cover significantly increased within MPAs than outside. The significant differences in the rate of coral cover change through time were influenced by chronic anthropogenic stresses, coinciding with the timing of thermal stress and the establishment of MPAs. The rate of change in coral cover was independent of the level of protection and the age and size of MPA. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:44","2022-10-11T14:40:44Z",NA,"5–17","","1","733",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bleaching; Coral cover; Marine protected areas; Meta-analysis; Philippines","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal AZT treatment on aggressive behaviour of adult male mice. Methods: Pregnant CD-1 mice were given saline vehicle, 0.4, or 0.8 mg/ml AZT in their drinking water from gestation day 10 to delivery. Social-aggressive types of interaction were assessed in their male offspring following a 4-week isolation period. Two groups of subjects were used, each undergoing a different type of test: test 1 consisted of a single 20-min encounter with an isolated same-strain opponent on postnatal day (PND) 90, while in test 2 (PND 150) subjects were paired for 10 min for 5 consecutive days with a non- isolated opponent. Results: Slight changes in both aggressive and defensive components of the male-specific agonistic pattern were evident only in test 1, AZT mice displaying a limited increase of aggressive behaviour compared to their controls.

We present a framework for using biodiversity indicators predictively to inform policy choices at a global level. The approach is illustrated with two case studies in which we project forwards the impacts of feasible policies on trends in biodiversity and in relevant indicators. The policies are based on targets agreed at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) meeting in Nagoya in October 2010. The first case study compares protected area policies for African mammals, assessed using the Red List Index; the second example uses the Living Planet Index to assess the impact of a complete halt, versus a reduction, in bottom trawling. In the protected areas example, we find that the indicator can aid in decision-making because it is able to differentiate between the impacts of the different policies. In the bottom trawling example, the indicator exhibits some counter-intuitive behaviour, due to over-representation of some taxonomic and functional groups in the indicator, and contrasting impacts of the policies on different groups caused by trophic interactions. Our results support the need for further research on how to use predictive models and indicators to credibly track trends and inform policy. To be useful and relevant, scientists must make testable predictions about the impact of global policy on biodiversity to ensure that targets such as those set at Nagoya catalyse effective and measurable change. © 2012 Nicholson et al.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:40:43","2022-10-11T14:40:43Z",NA,"e41128","","7","7",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The flaw in this approach is that distributions of species also reflect the influence of interactions with other species, so predictions based on climate envelopes may be very misleading if the interactions between species are altered by climate change. An additional problem is that current distributions may be the result of sources and sinks, in which species appear to thrive in places where they really persist only because individuals disperse into them from elsewhere. Here we use microcosm experiments on simple but realistic assemblages to show how misleading the climate envelope approach can be. We show that dispersal and interactions, which are important elements of population dynamics, must be included in predictions of biotic responses to climate change.",1998,"2022-10-11 14:40:43","2022-10-11T14:40:43Z",NA,"783–786","","6669","391",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As these are among the first OMPs to be implemented worldwide, some for periods longer than 10 y, they provide useful examples of some of the successes and problems encountered with the approach. Particular emphasis is given to some recent innovations and adaptations. These include moves to (i) joint two-species OMPs for the hake and sardine/anchovy resources, (ii) a reference set of weighted operating models for primary testing and tuning in preference to a single model; (iii) consideration of a ""research-conditional"" approach for hake to allow greater catches in the short term, conditional on research being implemented to resolve a key uncertainty, and (iv) incorporation of some ecosystem considerations by developing appropriate robustness tests (which link with moves towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries).

Twenty years on, how far have we come in incorporating nature's benefits in decision making, and where do we go from here? The US and the European Union (EU) are moving rapidly toward integrating the assessment of ecosystem services (ES) into their decision-making processes. Potential applications range from where to site energy infrastructure and how to prioritize new restoration projects to the ways we assess the environmental and human risks of new and existing chemicals and consider nature-based or “green” buildings as we replace aging infrastructure and adapt to climate change. In 2008, the US incorporated the ES concept into rules for compensatory mitigation of degraded aquatic resources. Four years later, in 2012, the US Forest Service instituted a rule requesting that an ES assessment be incorporated into all agency-related planning involving national forests and grasslands. And in 2013, the White House Council on Environmental Quality released new principles and requirements for federal spending on water resource and infrastructure projects that also require an assessment of ES. Several federal agencies – including the US Army Corps of Engineers; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the US Department of the Interior, which includes the US Bureau of Land Management and the US Fish and Wildlife Service – have started to develop guidance within the past few years on integrating the ES concept into their respective decision making. The US is not alone in recognizing the need to reflect ES in its decision making. In 2011, the EU published its Biodiversity Strategy, which set 2020 as a target for halting the loss of biodiversity and degradation of ES in EU Member States. The strategy is being implemented through relevant EU policies; one such policy is the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which outlines a clear legislative agenda for managing human activities and supporting sustainable use of marine resources through an ecosystem-based approach. As recently as last year, the EU also adopted a green infrastructure strategy, which recognizes that rural and urban lands alike provide multiple ES and promotes green infrastructure projects through agricultural, economic, and environmental policies, as well as in disaster risk management efforts. This welcomed adoption of an ES-based decision-making approach is not without its challenges, including implementing such requirements, better understanding how human activities affect ES, and quantifying the ways in which people use, appreciate, and value nature's benefits. A recent joint workshop – hosted by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry and the Ecological Society of America – at the National Conservation Training Center (Shepherdstown, WV) brought together international scientists from academia, government, and business to develop practical guidance for applying the ES concept to environmental decision making. One of the main conclusions from that workshop was that ecological production functions (EPFs), which translate ecological changes into outcomes that people use or value, are key to determining how anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems translate into changes in ES delivery. Another conclusion was that the complexity of natural systems can make it difficult to effectively and consistently incorporate ES considerations into decision making. Ultimately, that task will require governments and other partners to collect the pertinent data, develop EPF models, and, ideally, devise user-friendly decision-making tools, all of which can be shared through a well-maintained online network. Important efforts laying the foundations for consistency in methods and use include: the US Environmental Protection Agency's EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov), the National Ecosystem Services Partnership's Federal Resource Management and Ecosystem Services Guidebook (www.nespguidebook.com), the European Commission's Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services project (http://biodiversity.europa.eu/maes), and the United Nations Environment Programme's initiative The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (www.teebweb.org). Despite lingering questions about how to quantify, assess, and value ES, and the challenges involved in developing EPF models, it is important to move forward with efforts to incorporate ES considerations in decision making. Doing so will help us understand not only where and how to apply the ES concept in decision making but also how to develop useful common metrics and measures. Every application encourages forward momentum and adds to our understanding of the relationship between ecosystem change and ES production and value. The result will be an improved awareness and consideration of the policy-related impacts on the ES upon which all life depends.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:43","2022-10-11T14:40:43Z",NA,"539–539","","10","12",NA,NA,"Mainstreaming ecosystem services into decision mak",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Formal management strategy evaluation (MSE) facilitates quantitative assessment of strengths and weaknesses of alternative management strategies designed to meet multiple agenda. The reef line fishery on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) operates under multiple jurisdictions in a World Heritage Area with diverse stakeholder agenda for conservation and commercial and recreational harvest. We worked with stakeholders to identify: (i) specific objectives; (ii) alternative management strategies; and (iii) performance indicators to compare likelihoods of meeting economic, recreational and stock objectives for the fishery and conservation objectives for the effects of line fishing on the GBR. Stakeholders identified objectives and associated performance indicators in four categories, for: (1) conservation of unfished populations; (2) the harvestable stock; (3) economic performance of the fishery; (4) satisfaction of recreational fishers. We used a metapopulation and fishing simulation model (ELFSim) to assess the effects of three effort regimes in combination with three area closure regimes on the primary target species, common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus). The nine management strategies were also compared with a zero fishing scenario for reference. Controlling fishing effort most improved prospects of meeting economic, stock and recreational satisfaction objectives for the fishery. Nine of ten performance indicators across all stakeholder objectives were maximised when fishing effort was at the lowest non-zero level tested. Maximising the area closed to fishing with reduced fishing effort was most likely to achieve the conservation objectives. This research provides a case study of productive engagement with stakeholders to address fisheries and conservation management needs in a multi-sectoral spatial management context. Together, we provided a common currency (the prospect of meeting quantified objectives) for impartial evaluation of performance of alternative management options against diverse and often competing stakeholder agenda. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, MSE is also useful for evaluating strategies designed to manage incidental take from endangered populations. We adapted MSE to the case of Sacramento River winter Chinook salmon, an endangered population that is subject to incidental take by mixed-stock ocean salmon fisheries that target more abundant stocks. Pursuant to the US Endangered Species Act, the US National Marine Fisheries Service called for a new fishery management strategy that would link the allowable fishing mortality to the population's risk of extinction. Our objective was to evaluate extinction risk under different harvest strategies. We simulated the dynamics of the salmon population and the management process simultaneously. The management process included harvest strategies that set allowable fishing mortality rates as a function of population size. Strategies that reduced fishing mortality rates in response to low estimates of population size resulted in lower extinction risk than strategies that set fishing mortality rates at current or historical levels. The number of years of data taken into account by a strategy and the extent of reductions in fishing mortality resulted in different frequencies and durations of reduced fishing opportunity. By quantifying the trade-off between the risk of extinction of an endangered population and the opportunity for fisheries to harvest target stocks, our study illustrated the utility of MSE for applications to endangered populations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:40:42","2022-10-11T14:40:42Z",NA,"155–166","","","158",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Chinook salmon; Extinction risk; Fishery; Management strategy evaluation; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Simulation","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although uncertainty is recognized as a feature of natural resource management, little attention has been given to the uncertainty generated by institutional settings, historical contingency, and individual people's influence. These implementation uncertainties, related to the translation of policy into practice, make it difficult to predict the outcomes of management interventions within social-ecological systems. Using the conservation of species hunted for bushmeat in the Serengeti as a case study, we investigated the challenges and potential barriers to successful implementation of natural resource management policies. We used a mixed-methods approach, combining semistructured interviews with scenario building, social network, and institutional analysis exercises. Using a management strategy evaluation (MSE) conceptual framework, we obtained insights into the constraints and opportunities for fulfilling stakeholder aspirations for the social-ecological system, analyzed the multiple roles played by different institutions in the system, and described the interactions between different actor types. We found that the respondents had generally similar views about the current and future status of the Serengeti but disagreed about how to address issues of conservation concern and were more uncertain about the actual outcomes of management interventions. Improving conservation implementation (rather than research, monitoring, or status assessment) was perceived as the key priority to be addressed. Institutional barriers were perceived as an important challenge given that the decision-making and implementation processes were broadly distributed across a number of institutions. Conservation social networks were centered on very few individuals, suggesting their importance in bridging across conservation arenas but also potentially affecting the resilience of governance structures. Our study gives an improved understanding of the underlying causes of discrepancies between conservation plans and outcomes for this case study, as well as providing a novel framework for the analysis of implementation uncertainties more broadly. A next step would be to use this framework as a basis for collaboratively developed models that integrate research findings with specific management questions. By bringing tools and findings from social psychology, natural resource management, and bioeconomics together into a unified operational framework, researchers may be better able to understand the barriers to successful resource management and engage with stakeholders to overcome them. © 2014 by the author(s).",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:42","2022-10-11T14:40:42Z",NA,"52","","2","19",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bushmeat; Implementation uncertainty; Institutions; Knowing-doing gap; Management strategy evaluation; Protected area management; Serengeti; Social networks; Social-ecological modeling; Stakeholders","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such variability in data quality may result in biased predictions obtained from species distribution models (SDMs). We aimed to identify the limitations of different monitoring data sources for developing species distribution maps and to evaluate their potential for spatial data integration in a conservation context. Using Maxent, SDMs were generated from three different bird data sources in Catalonia, which differ in the degree of standardisation and available sample size. In addition, an alternative approach for modelling species distributions was applied, which combined the three data sources at a large spatial scale, but then downscaling to the required resolution. Finally, SDM predictions were used to identify species richness and high quality areas (hotspots) from different treatments. Models were evaluated by using high quality Atlas information. We show that both sample size and survey methodology used to collect the data are important in delivering robust information on species distributions. Models based on standardized monitoring provided higher accuracy with a lower sample size, especially when modelling common species. Accuracy of models from opportunistic observations substantially increased when modelling uncommon species, giving similar accuracy to a more standardized survey. Although downscaling data through a SDM approach appears to be a useful tool in cases of data shortage or low data quality and heterogeneity, it will tend to overestimate species distributions. In order to identify distributions of species, data with different quality may be appropriate. However, to identify biodiversity hotspots high quality information is needed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:40:41","2022-10-11T14:40:41Z",NA,"2927–2948","","11","21",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Citizen science; Farmland Birds; Maxent; Occurrence data bias; Species distribution models","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We mapped a diverse set of provisioning, regulating and cultural services, focusing on services that depend on the landscape structure. Services were mapped using global-scale data sets. We evaluated the models for a sample area comprising Eastern Europe. ESFs are mainly available in natural areas, while hotspots of ESS supply are found in areas with heterogeneous land cover. Here, natural land cover where ESFs are available is mixed with areas where the ESSs are utilized. We conclude that spatial patterns of several ESFs and ESSs can be mapped at global scale using existing global-scale data sets.

The paper presents a case study on evaluating and mapping the spatial and temporal impacts of the tsunami on land use and land cover (LULC) and related ecosystem service supply in the Phang Nga province, Thailand. The method includes local stakeholder interviews, field investigations, remote-sensing techniques, and GIS. Results provide an ecosystem services matrix with capacity scores for 18 LULC classes and 17 ecosystem functions and services as well as pre-/post-tsunami and recovery maps indicating changes in the ecosystem service supply capacities in the study area. Local stakeholder interviews revealed that mangroves, casuarina forest, mixed beach forest, coral reefs, tidal inlets, as well as wetlands (peat swamp forest) have the highest capacity to supply ecosystem services, while e.g. plantations have a lower capacity. The remote-sensing based damage and recovery analysis showed a loss of the ecosystem service supply capacities in almost all LULC classes for most of the services due to the tsunami. A fast recovery of LULC and related ecosystem service supply capacities within one year could be observed for e.g. beaches, while mangroves or casuarina forest needed several years to recover. Applying multi-temporal mapping the spatial variations of recovery could be visualised. While some patches of coastal forest were fully recovered after 3 yr, other patches were still affected and thus had a reduced capacity to supply ecosystem services. The ecosystem services maps can be used to quantify ecological values and their spatial distribution in the framework of a tsunami risk assessment. Beyond that they are considered to be a useful tool for spatial analysis in coastal risk management in Phang Nga.\textless/p\textgreater",2013,"2022-10-11 14:40:40","2022-10-11T14:40:40Z",NA,"3095–3111","","12","13",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most MPAs have been established and managed by communities together with local governments in a variety of community-based and co-management schemes. This approach has proven successful in gaining community acceptance and achieving local-scale fisheries and conservation objectives. However, the contribution of these MPAs to ecologically connected networks of MPAs is variable since most MPAs were not designed to be parts of networks. Nevertheless, there is growing support for the development of MPAs within the national integrated coastal management framework which supports the "" scaling up"" of MPAs to establish networks. Scaling up in the Philippine context is achieved by forging inter-institutional collaboration among neighboring local governments (i.e. village to provincial level), with the assistance of other institutions such as non-government organizations, academe, government agencies, and development partners including donors. Herein we review the history of MPAs in the Philippines and the development of inter-institutional collaborations and present examples of scaling up of MPAs to form networks. To further the establishment of social and ecological MPA networks in the Philippines, we describe approaches to forming MPA networks and discuss the fundamental elements of successful collaborative partnerships. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:40:40","2022-10-11T14:40:40Z",NA,"15–26","","0","64",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, we do not yet have an adequate way of monitoring progress towards achieving this target. Here we present a method for producing indices based on the IUCN Red List to chart the overall threat status (projected relative extinction risk) of all the world's bird species from 1988 to 2004. Red List Indices (RLIs) are based on the number of species in each Red List category, and on the number changing categories between assessments as a result of genuine improvement or deterioration in status. The RLI for all bird species shows that their overall threat status has continued to deteriorate since 1988. Disaggregated indices show that deteriorations have occurred worldwide and in all major ecosystems, but with particularly steep declines in the indices for Indo-Malayan birds (driven by intensifying deforestation of the Sundaic lowlands) and for albatrosses and petrels (driven by incidental mortality in commercial longline fisheries). RLIs complement indicators based on species population trends and habitat extent for quantifying global trends in the status of biodiversity. Their main weaknesses are that the resolution of status changes is fairly coarse and that delays may occur before some status changes are detected. Their greatest strength is that they are based on information from nearly all species in a taxonomic group worldwide, rather than a potentially biased subset. At present, suitable data are only available for birds, but indices for other taxonomic groups are in development, as is a sampled index based on a stratified sample from all major taxonomic groups.",2004,"2022-10-11 14:40:39","2022-10-11T14:40:39Z",NA,"e383","","12","2",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 15510230",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Trends in ecosystem services (fresh water, food, fuel-wood, cultural and biodiversity) over the period 1990-2000 were mixed across scales. Freshwater resources appear strained across the continent with large numbers of people not securing adequate supplies, especially of good quality water. This translates to high infant mortality patterns across the region. In some areas, the use of water resources for irrigated agriculture and urban-industrial expansion is taking place at considerable cost to the quality and quantity of freshwater available to ecosystems and for domestic use. Staple cereal production across the region has increased but was outstripped by population growth while protein malnutrition is on the rise. The much-anticipated wood-fuel crisis on the subcontinent has not materialized but some areas are experiencing shortages while numerous others remain vulnerable. Cultural benefits of biodiversity are considerable, though hard to quantify or track over time. Biodiversity resources remain at reasonable levels, but are declining faster than reflected in species extinction rates and appear highly sensitive to land-use decisions. The SAfMA sub-global assessment provided an opportunity to experiment with innovative ways to assess ecosystem services including the use of supply-demand surfaces, service sources and sink areas, priority areas for service provision, service 'hotspots' and trade-off assessments.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:40:39","2022-10-11T14:40:39Z",NA,"425–441","","1454","360",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Assessment; Ecosystem services; Human well-being; Multi-scale; Southern African Millennium Ecosystem Assessment","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These topics that are related to the development of human societies have become increasingly important since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) or Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In this article, we are interested in the first issue. We present here many examples of the help that using mathematical programming can provide to decision-makers in the protection of biodiversity. The examples we have chosen concern the selection of nature reserves, the control of adverse effects caused by landscape fragmentation, including the creation or restoration of biological corridors, the ecological exploitation of forests, the control of invasive species, and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Most of the presented models are - or can be approximated with - linear-, quadratic- or fractional-integer formulations and emphasize spatial aspects of conservation planning. Many of them represent decisions taken in a static context but temporal dimension is also considered. The problems presented are generally difficult combinatorial optimization problems, some are well solved and others less well. Research is still needed to progress in solving them in order to deal with real instances satisfactorily. Moreover, relations between researchers and practitioners have to be strengthened. Furthermore, many recent achievements in the field of robust optimization could probably be successfully used for biodiversity protection, a domain in which many data are uncertain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Marine decapod crustaceans, such as lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, support important fisheries from tropical to polar seas. The high unit value of decapods and their longstanding importance in coastal fisheries have provided powerful incentives for scientific study of their ecology and population dynamics. Observed spatial patterns of benthic life stages, larval dispersal mechanisms, genetic structure, and the level of synchrony in fluctuations in abundance are consistent with underlying metapopulation structures for the decapods considered in the chapter. Although there is sufficient evidence to conclude that metapopulation structure and dynamics are important in decapod populations and that marine reserves may be particularly appropriate for species with their life history, a complete understanding of decapod metapopulation dynamics is still faraway. The dynamic behavior of metapopulations depends on tendencies in local single population behavior and the connectivity among these populations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no de?nitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most in?uential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and ?nally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some in?uence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g. institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g. motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex ?eld. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were in?uenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981)",2002,"2022-10-11 14:40:37","2022-10-11T14:40:37Z",NA,"239–260","","3","8",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These systems may be profoundly influenced by human decisions at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and the limitations of traditional process-level ecosystems modeling approaches for representing the richness of factors shaping landscape dynamics in these coupled systems has resulted in the need for new analysis approaches. New tools in the areas of spatial data management and analysis, multicriteria decision-making, individual-based modeling, and complexity science have all begun to impact how we approach modeling these systems. The term ""biocomplexity"" has emerged as a descriptor of the rich patterns of interactions and behaviors in human and natural systems, and the challenges of analyzing biocomplex behavior is resulting in a convergence of approaches leading to new ways of understanding these systems. Important questions related to system vulnerability and resilience, adaptation, feedback processing, cycling, non-linearities and other complex behaviors are being addressed using models employing new representational approaches to analysis. The complexity inherent in these systems challenges the modeling community to provide tools that capture sufficiently the richness of human and ecosystem processes and interactions in ways that are computationally tractable and understandable. We examine one such tool, EvoLand, which uses an actor-based approach to conduct alternative futures analyses in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a framework has been developed for assessments on land, and is now being developed for application to marine ecosystems.

The approach allows the simultaneous grouping and quantification of multiple species' responses to environmental gradients. The underlying statistical model is a finite mixture model, where mixing is performed over the individual species' responses to environmental gradients. Species with similar responses are grouped with minimal information loss. We term these groups species archetypes. Each species archetype has an associated GLM that can be used to predict distributions with appropriate measures of uncertainty. Initially, we illustrate the concept and method using artificial data and then with application to real data comprising 200 species from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon on 13 oceanographic and geological gradients from 12°S to 24°S. The 200 species from the GBR are well represented by 15 species archetypes. The model is interpreted through maps of the probability of presence for a fine scale set of locations throughout the study area. Maps of uncertainty are also produced to provide statistical context. The presence of each species archetype was strongly influenced by oceanographic gradients, principally temperature, oxygen and salinity. The number of species in each group ranged from 4 to 34. The method has potential application to the analysis of multispecies distribution patterns and for multispecies management. © 2010.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:40:37","2022-10-11T14:40:37Z",NA,"955–963","","4","222",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Finite mixture model; Grouping; Prediction; Species archetype","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Polyscape currently includes algorithms to explore the impacts of land cover change on flood risk, habitat connectivity, erosion and associated sediment delivery to receptors, carbon sequestration and agricultural productivity. Algorithms to trade these single-criteria landscape valuations against each other are also provided, identifying where multiple service synergies exist or could be established. Changes in land management can be input to the tool and ""traffic light"" coded impact maps produced, allowing visualisation of the impact of different decisions. Polyscape hence offers a means for prioritising existing feature preservation and identifying opportunities for landscape change. The basic algorithms can be applied using widely available national scale digital elevation, land use and soil data. Enhanced output is possible where higher resolution data are available (e.g., LIDAR, detailed land use or soil surveys).

By contrast, an average of 30% of species' ESH fell within Important Bird Areas (IBAs), a network of sites identified using globally standardized criteria as critical for bird conservation. IBAs that overlapped or fell within PAs were significantly less effective at covering the ESH of threatened birds than those falling outside the PA network, and for IBAs partly overlapping with PAs, coverage of threatened birds was significantly greater in the unprotected part.

Despite this knowledge, efforts to map the distribution of ESs often rely on simple spatial surrogates that provide incomplete and non-mechanistic representations of the biophysical variables they are intended to proxy. However, alternative data sets are available that allow for more direct, spatially nuanced inputs to ES mapping efforts. Many spatially explicit, quantitative estimates of biophysical parameters are currently supported by remote sensing, with great relevance to ES mapping. Additional parameters that are not amenable to direct detection by remote sensing may be indirectly modeled with spatial environmental data layers. We review the capabilities of modern remote sensing for describing biodiversity, plant traits, vegetation condition, ecological processes, soil properties, and hydrological variables and highlight how these products may contribute to ES assessments. Because these products often provide more direct estimates of the ecological properties controlling ESs than the spatial proxies currently in use, they can support greater mechanistic realism in models of ESs. By drawing on the increasing range of remote sensing instruments and measurements, data sets appropriate to the estimation of a given ES can be selected or developed. In so doing, we anticipate rapid progress to the spatial characterization of ecosystem services, in turn supporting ecological conservation, management, and integrated land use planning.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:35","2022-10-11T14:40:35Z",NA,"328–353","","3",38,NA,NA,"Potential contributions of remote sensing to ecosy",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Landsat; LiDAR; MODIS; biodiversity; ecosystem function; ecosystem processes; ecosystem services; functional traits; hyperspectral; landscape functions","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Combinations of the individual species model outcomes allowed estimates of species richness (from among the 80 species) and forest type (from simple rules) for each of 2100 counties in the eastern United States. Average species richness across all counties may increase slightly with climatic change. This increase tends to be larger as the average temperature of the climate change scenario increases. Dramatic changes in the distribution of potential forest types were modeled. All five scenarios project the extirpation of the spruce-fir forest types from New England.

We quantified the effect of human population growth and development on rates of deforestation and analyzed the relationship between these causal factors in the 1980s and 1990s. We compared the averages of population growth, human development index (HDI, which measures income, health, and education), and deforestation rate and computed correlations among these variables for countries that contain biodiversity hotspots. When population growth was high and HDI was low there was a high rate of deforestation, but when HDI was high, rate of deforestation was low, despite high population growth. The correlation among variables was significant for the 1990s but not for the 1980s. The relationship between population growth and HDI had a regional pattern that reflected the historical process of development. Based on the changes in HDI and deforestation rate over time, we identified two drivers of deforestation: policy choice and human-development constraints. Policy choices that disregard conservation may cause the loss of forests even in countries that are relatively developed. Lack of development in other countries, on the other hand, may increase the pressure on forests to meet the basic needs of the human population. Deforestation resulting from policy choices may be easier to fix than deforestation arising from human development constraints. To prevent deforestation in the countries that have such constraints, transfer of material and intellectual resources from developed countries may be needed.

We thus estimated how many taxa could be affected by future threats that are usually not included in current IUCN Red List assessments. Here, we computed the Red List status including future threats of 227 Proteaceae taxa endemic to the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, and compared this with their Red List status excluding future threats. We developed eight different land use and climate change scenarios for the year 2020, providing a range of best- to worst-case scenarios. Four scenarios include only the effects of future land use change, while the other four also include the impacts of projected anthropogenic climate change (HadCM2 IS92a GGa), using niche-based models. Up to a third of the 227 Proteaceae taxa are uplisted (become more threatened) by up to three threat categories if future threats as predicted for 2020 are included, and the proportion of threatened Proteaceae taxa rises on average by 9% (range 2-16%), depending on the scenario. With increasing severity of the scenarios, the proportion of Critically Endangered taxa increases from about 1% to 7% and almost 2% of the 227 Proteaceae taxa become Extinct because of climate change. Overall, climate change has the most severe effects on the Proteaceae, but land use change also severely affects some taxa. Most of the threatened taxa occur in low-lying coastal areas, but the proportion of threatened taxa changes considerably in inland mountain areas if future threats are included.

However, few countries as yet have formal SEA regulations, and few completed SEAs have demonstrated all the elements of current best practice. The Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment aims to provide a unique analysis of SEAs which have been undertaken, drawing on a variety of methods and circumstances to illustrate how best practice can be achieved, and providing inspiration for those considering studying, commission or carrying out an SEA. Part I sets the rest of the book in context, giving a review of international SEA guidance and regulations, and discussing models and methodologies. Part II then analyses a comprehensive set of case studies from countries which have extensive experience in SEA, or which provide particularly good examples. The case studies are discussed in three sections ? sectoral SEAs, SEAs of land-use plans and SEAs of policies ? and provide examples of different scales and approaches, as well as country-specific experience. The final chapter draws out some constraints to effective SEA, as well as positive themes which show how effective SEA can contribute to wider environmental assessment.

However, the community-level approaches applied to date have been largely correlative, ignoring the key processes that influence change in biodiversity over space and time.

These models predict species richness of endemic South American birds (2248 species) measured at a continental scale. We demonstrate that the principal single-factor and composite (species-energy, water-energy and temperature-kinetics) models proposed thus far fail to predict (r(2) \textless or =.05) the richness of species with small to moderately large geographical ranges (first three range-size quartiles).

Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance, but others cannot. In parallel, demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single populations. However, this demographic work has rarely taken a landscape perspective and has largely ignored the effects of intraspecific density.

The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.",2002,"2022-10-11 14:40:33","2022-10-11T14:40:33Z",NA,"545–556","","5",16,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biogeochemical cycles; Disturbance; Effect traits; Fire; Resource gradient; Response traits; Scaling-up; Trade-offs","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species.

Little effort has so far been made to predict the species composition of a community explicitly. The modelling approach presented here provides a conceptual framework on how to achieve this by combining habitat models for a large number of species to an additive community model. Our approach is exemplified by Nardus stricta communities (acidophilous, low-productive grassland). Location: Large areas of Germany, 0-2040 m a.s.l. Methods: Logistic regression is applied for individual species models which are subsequently combined for an explicit prediction of species composition. Several parameters reflecting soil, management and climatic conditions serve as predictor variables. For validation, bootstrap and jackknife resampling procedures are used as well as ordination techniques (DCA, CCA). Results: We calculated significant models for 138 individual species.

The aim of the workshop was to compare the results of a number of North Sea ecosystem models under different reduction scenarios. In order to achieve comparability of model results the participants were requested to use a minimum spin-up time, common boundary conditions which were derived from a wider-domain model, and a set of common forcing data, with special emphasis on a complete coverage of river nutrient loads. Based on the OSPAR requirements river loads were derived, taking into account the reductions already achieved between 1985 and 2002 for each country. First, for the year 2002, for which the Comprehensive Procedure was applied, the different horizontal distributions of net primary production are compared. Furthermore, the differences in the net primary production between the hindcast run and the 50% nutrient reduction runs are displayed. In order to compare local results, the hindcast and reduction runs are presented for selected target areas and scored against the Comprehensive Procedure assessment levels for the parameters DIN, DIP and chlorophyll. Finally, the temporal development of the assessment parameter bottom oxygen concentration from several models is compared with data from the Dutch monitoring station Terschelling 135. The conclusion from the workshop was that models are useful to support the application of the OSPAR Comprehensive Procedure. The comparative exercise formulated specifically for the workshop required models to be evaluated for pre-defined target areas previously classified as problem areas according to the first application of the Comprehensive Procedure. The responsiveness of the modelled assessment parameters varied between different models but in general the parameter showed a larger response in coastal rather than in offshore waters, which in some cases lead to the goal to achieve a non-problem status. Therefore, the application of the Comprehensive Procedure on model results for parameter assessment opens a new potential in testing eutrophication reduction measures within the North Sea catchment. As a result of the workshop further work was proposed to confirm and bolster confidence in the results. One general field of difficulty appeared to be the model forcing with SPM data in order to achieve realistic levels of light attenuation. Finally, effects of the prescribed spin-up procedure are compared against a long-term run over many years and consequences on the resulting initial nutrient concentrations are highlighted. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:40:32","2022-10-11T14:40:32Z",NA,"148–170","","1-2",81,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem modeling; Eutrophication; Eutrophication assessment; North Sea; OSPAR Comprehensive Procedure; Reduction scenarios; River nutrient loads","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers.

There is a clear need to increase our ability to predict the consequences of environmental change. The seven main approaches that are currently used are: extrapolation, experiments, phenomenological models, game-theory population models, expert opinion, outcome-driven modelling and scenarios. Each approach has different strengths and weaknesses. In practice, several approaches are often combined. 2. Adaptive management aimed at testing hypotheses is excellent in principle and widely advocated. In reality, however, it is almost never carried out because the changes in management usually have to be severe in order to bring about detectable changes in a reasonable time, and the political risks of such management are usually considered too high. 3. Game-theory population models are used to determine population-level phenomena based upon the decisions individuals make in response to resource depletion, interference, territoriality or rank. This allows predictions to be made regarding responses to novel conditions. The main drawback is that for some models considerable information is required. 4. Much of conservation practice is not based upon evidence. Evidence-based conservation is the practice of accumulating, reviewing and disseminating evidence with the aim of formulating appropriate management strategies. Evidence-based medicine revolutionized medical practice and similar opportunities exist to improve conservation practice. 5. Synthesis and applications .

Here, we introduce a dynamic and spatially-explicit model of deforestation that predicts the potential magnitude and spatial pattern of Amazon deforestation. Our model differs from previous models in three ways: (1) it is probabilistic and quantifies uncertainty around predictions and parameters; (2) the overall deforestation rate emerges ""bottom up"", as the sum of local-scale deforestation driven by local processes; and (3) deforestation is contagious, such that local deforestation rate increases through time if adjacent locations are deforested. For the scenarios evaluated-pre- and post-PPCDAM (""Plano de Ação para Proteção e Controle do Desmatamento na Amazônia"")-the parameter estimates confirmed that forests near roads and already deforested areas are significantly more likely to be deforested in the near future and less likely in protected areas. Validation tests showed that our model correctly predicted the magnitude and spatial pattern of deforestation that accumulates over time, but that there is very high uncertainty surrounding the exact sequence in which pixels are deforested. The model predicts that under pre-PPCDAM (assuming no change in parameter values due to, for example, changes in government policy), annual deforestation rates would halve between 2050 compared to 2002, although this partly reflects reliance on a static map of the road network. Consistent with other models, under the pre-PPCDAM scenario, states in the south and east of the Brazilian Amazon have a high predicted probability of losing nearly all forest outside of protected areas by 2050. This pattern is less strong in the post-PPCDAM scenario. Contagious spread along roads and through areas lacking formal protection could allow deforestation to reach the core, which is currently experiencing low deforestation rates due to its isolation. © 2013 Rosa et al.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:40:31","2022-10-11T14:40:31Z",NA,"e77231","","10",8,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture; Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Models; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Statistical; Trees","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers). Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used. Synthesis and applications. Ecologists face several challenges to ensure the healthy development of an operational predictive ecological science: (i) clarity on the distinction between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (ii) developing new theories at the interface between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (iii) open data to test and validate predictions; (iv) making predictions operational; and (v) developing a genuine ethics of prediction.

The forests are a global priority for biodiversity conservation and provide vital resources to the Tanzanian population. Here, we make a first attempt to predict the spatial distribution of 40 EAM tree species, using generalised additive models, plot data and environmental predictor maps at sub 1 km resolution. The results of three modelling experiments are presented, investigating predictions obtained by (1) two different procedures for the stepwise selection of predictors, (2) down-weighting absence data, and (3) incorporating an autocovariate term to describe fine-scale spatial aggregation. In response to recent concerns regarding the extrapolation of model predictions beyond the restricted environmental range of training data, we also demonstrate a novel graphical tool for quantifying envelope uncertainty in restricted range niche-based models (envelope uncertainty maps). We find that even for species with very few documented occurrences useful estimates of distribution can be achieved. Initiating selection with a null model is found to be useful for explanatory purposes, while beginning with a full predictor set can over-fit the data. We show that a simple multimodel average of these two best-model predictions yields a superior compromise between generality and precision (parsimony). Down-weighting absences shifts the balance of errors in favour of higher sensitivity, reducing the number of serious mistakes (i.e., falsely predicted absences); however, response functions are more complex, exacerbating uncertainty in larger models. Spatial autocovariates help describe fine-scale patterns of occurrence and significantly improve explained deviance, though if important environmental constraints are omitted then model stability and explanatory power can be compromised. We conclude that the best modelling practice is contingent both on the intentions of the analyst (explanation or prediction) and on the quality of distribution data; generalised additive models have potential to provide valuable information for conservation in the EAMs, but methods must be carefully considered, particularly if occurrence data are scarce.

Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding(6,7).

This is an important area of inquiry since the process of conducting an ESA is likely to affect the quality of results and their influence on decisions. Drawing on the lessons of conducting ESAs around the world, we propose a set of enabling conditions and a framework for carrying out ESAs that foster high-quality results and drive action. Our framework includes an emphasis on iterative stakeholder engagement, advancing science to address policy needs, and capacity-building through six general steps: (1) scope the process, (2) collect and compile data, (3) develop scenarios, (4) analyze ecosystem services, (5) synthesize results, and (6) communicate knowledge. Our experience indicates that using this framework to conduct an ESA can generate policy-relevant science and enhance uptake of information about natures benefits in decisions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:40:30","2022-10-11T14:40:30Z",NA,"190–204","","3",11,NA,NA,"Process matters: a framework for conducting decisi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"capacity-building; decision support; ecosystem services; enabling conditions; iteration; monitoring; scenarios; science-policy","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Processbased models, which are based on a theoretical understanding of relevant ecological processes, provide a useful framework to incorporate specific responses to altered environmental conditions. As a result, these models can offer significant advantages in predicting the effects of global change as compared to purely statistical or rule-based models based on previously collected data. Process-based models also offer more explicitly stated assumptions and easier interpretation than detailed simulation models. We provide guidelines for identifying the appropriate type of model and level of complexity for management decisions.

We used the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios to evaluate the exposure of all 8,750 land bird species to projected land-cover changes due to climate and land-use change. For this first baseline assessment, we assumed stationary geographic ranges that may overestimate actual losses in geographic range. Even under environmentally benign scenarios, at least 400 species are projected to suffer \textgreater50% range reductions by the year 2050 (over 900 by the year 2100). Although expected climate change effects at high latitudes are significant, species most at risk are predominantly narrow-ranged and endemic to the tropics, where projected range contractions are driven by anthropogenic land conversions. Most of these species are currently not recognized as imperiled. The causes, magnitude and geographic patterns of potential range loss vary across socioeconomic scenarios, but all scenarios (even the most environmentally benign ones) result in large declines of many species. Whereas climate change will severely affect biodiversity, in the near future, land-use change in tropical countries may lead to yet greater species loss.

Among these models a warming trend is universal, but projected changes in precipitation vary in sign and magnitude. Two independent methods are applied: a dynamic global vegetation model to assess changes in plant functional types and bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess changes in individual tree and shrub species and biodiversity. The former approach investigates broad responses of plant functional types to climate change, while considering competition, disturbances, and carbon fertilization, while the latter approach focuses on the response of individual plant species, and net biodiversity, to climate change. The dynamic model simulates a region-wide reduction in vegetation cover during the 21st century, with a partial replacement of evergreen trees with grasses in the mountains of Colorado and Utah, except at the highest elevations, where tree cover increases. Across southern Arizona, central New Mexico, and eastern Colorado, grass cover declines, in some cases abruptly. Due to the prevalent warming trend among all 17 climate models, vegetation cover declines in the 21st century, with the greatest vegetation losses associated with models that project a drying trend. The inclusion of the carbon fertilization effect largely ameliorates the projected vegetation loss. Based on bioclimatic envelope modeling for the 21st century, the number of tree and shrub species that are expected to experience robust declines in range likely outweighs the number of species that are expected to expand in range. Dramatic shifts in plant species richness are projected, with declines in the high-elevation evergreen forests, increases in the eastern New Mexico prairies, and a northward shift of the Sonoran Desert biodiversity maximum.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:40:28","2022-10-11T14:40:28Z",NA,"1365–1388","","4",22,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bioclimatic envelope model; Biodiversity; Climate change; Dynamic global vegetation model; Southwest United States","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We address these gaps in knowledge by combining municipal-level panel data on diseases, public health services, climatic factors, demographics, conservation policies, and other drivers of land-use change in the Brazilian Amazon. To fully exploit this dataset, we estimate random-effects and quantile regression models of disease incidence. We find that malaria, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and diarrhea incidence are significantly and negatively correlated with the area under strict environmental protection. Results vary by disease for other types of protected areas (PAs), roads, and mining. The relationships between diseases and land-use change drivers also vary by quantile of the disease distribution. Conservation scenarios based on estimated regression results suggest that malaria, ARI, and diarrhea incidence would be reduced by expanding strict PAs, and malaria could be further reduced by restricting roads and mining.

This use stimulated the development of a new set of quantitative criteria for listing species in the categories of threat: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. These criteria, which were intended to be applicable to all species except microorganisms, were part of a broader system for classifying threatened species and were fully implemented by IUCN in 2000. The system and the criteria have been widely used by conservation practitioners and scientists and now underpin one indicator being used to assess the Convention on Biological Diversity 2010 biodiversity target. We describe the process and the technical background to the IUCN Red List system. The criteria refer to fundamental biological processes underlying population decline and extinction. But given major differences between species, the threatening processes affecting them, and the paucity of knowledge relating to most species, the IUCN system had to be both broad and flexible to be applicable to the majority of described species. The system was designed to measure the symptoms of extinction risk, and uses 5 independent criteria relating to aspects of population loss and decline of range size. A species is assigned to a threat category if it meets the quantitative threshold for at least one criterion. The criteria and the accompanying rules and guidelines used by IUCN are intended to increase the consistency, transparency, and validity of its categorization system, but it necessitates some compromises that affect the applicability of the system and the species lists that result. In particular, choices were made over the assessment of uncertainty, poorly known species, depleted species, population decline, restricted ranges, and rarity; all of these affect the way red lists should be viewed and used. Processes related to priority setting and the development of national red lists need to take account of some assumptions in the formulation of the criteria.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:40:26","2022-10-11T14:40:26Z",NA,"1424–1442","","6",22,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation priority setting; Extinction risk; IUCN red list; Threatened species","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We reviewed the scope and data requirements of these methods and discussed the strengths and limitations of their application. We identified five groups of methods applicable to habitat types that define: (1) fixed percentage targets across all habitats based on species-area relationship, or habitat-specific targets based on (2) species-area relationship, (3) heuristic principles, (4) trade-off of target size with reserved area, or (5) spatially-explicit Population Viability Analysis (PVA) for selected species. No ideal method exists and two factors should guide the choice of a method: the type of biodiversity goal and data availability.

Adaptive spatial planning is advocated because it allows decisions to be improved with new data, as knowledge accumulates on management within particular contexts, and to fine-tune spatial management arrangements to fit constantly changing social-ecological systems. Yet, to date there have been very few reviews of the process and practice of adaptive spatial planning in real-world contexts. Here we review the theoretical challenges presented in the literature on adaptive spatial planning against 5 case studies of adaptive planning in the marine realm: Kubulau District, Fiji; Southeast Cebu, Philippines; the Great Barrier Reef, Australia; central California, USA; and KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Our aim is to assess the extent to which the theoretical challenges have been addressed in practice. We find that none of the case studies analyzed effectively addressed all the challenges of adaptive spatial planning. Differences in legislation, resources, and capacity to undertake adaptive spatial planning mean that each planning process is operated differently in each case study. For example, adaptive spatial planning can occur through a structured and institutionalized approach when resources and government support are available, but it can also operate in a relatively more opportunistic and flexible way if governments are weaker but civil society has strong champions. Although the case studies addressed aspects of adaptive planning, some persistent challenges remain, including scientific gaps regarding triggers for adaptation and unsympathetic institutional and policy contexts and planning cultures. These challenges must be addressed before all the benefits of adaptive spatial planning can be realized.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:40:25","2022-10-11T14:40:25Z",NA,"54–63","","0",181,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Adaptive planning; Implementation; Priority setting; Systematic conservation planning; Uncertainty","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two experiments tested this normative range-sensitivity principle for three weight assessment methods: direct importance weights, trade-off weights, and swing weights. Weights elicited using the direct importance weight method were range-insensitive, contrary to the standard normative model. Weights elicited using the swing weight and trade-off methods both displayed statistically significant range sensitivity, although both methods were less range-sensitive than predicted by the normative model.

This leads to high uncertainty in parameter values and model outputs and complicates the formulation of clear recommendations for conservation management. We present a comprehensive procedure that is able to process spatiotemporal patterns of metapopulation occupancy to rank management scenarios. The first step of the procedure involves the formulation of the stochastic metapopulation model and the estimation of parameter values with a Bayesian approach, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second step, the model is used to predict the effects of different management actions, taking into account the uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Finally, in the third step, decision analysis is used to evaluate and aggregate the results of the previous step into a simple rank order of management scenarios. The procedure was applied to a metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary, Melitaea cinxia. Although the amount of available occupancy data was considerable, the uncertainty in the estimated model parameter values was so large that a precise estimate of the extinction risk of the metapopulation could not be made. However, the procedure was able to produce a rank order of management scenarios that was extraordinarily robust to the uncertainty. Application of the procedure to two other case studies revealed that, even though robust rankings cannot always be obtained, the results of the procedure are helpful in assessing the degree of uncertainty in the ranking and pointing to those factors most responsible for the lack of robustness.

Up-to-date knowledge on species distribution is needed for efficient biodiversity conservation and management decision-making. Implementing efficient sampling strategies to identify previously unknown locations of species of conservation-concern is therefore a key challenge. Both structured expert judgement and habitat suitability models may help target sampling towards areas where chances to find the species are highest. However, practitioners often object to the use of models and believe they do not result in better decisions than the subjective opinion of experts, thus potentially constraining an optimal use of available methods and information. To illustrate the potential of habitat suitability models for guiding sampling strategies, we evaluated and compared the ability of experts and models to identify important areas for the conservation of a bird species (Lanius collurio) in Luxembourg. We conducted extensive fieldwork to find as many unknown bird territories as possible according to three independent sampling strategies: (i) a sampling strategy based on structured expert judgement, (ii) a sampling strategy based on the predictions of a habitat suitability model and (iii) a general-purpose stratified random sampling strategy used as a baseline reference. Both the expert-based and the model-based sampling strategies substantially outperformed the general-purpose sampling strategy in identifying new species records. In addition, the model-based sampling strategy performed significantly better than the expert-based sampling strategy. Synthesis and applications.

Understanding their impacts on deforestation informs environmental policies. We review several approaches to evaluating protection's impact on deforestation, given three hurdles to empirical evaluation, and note that ""matching"" techniques from economic impact evaluation address those hurdles. The central hurdle derives from the fact that protected areas are distributed nonrandomly across landscapes. Nonrandom location can be intentional, and for good reasons, including biological and political ones. Yet even so, when protected areas are biased in their locations toward less-threatened areas, many methods for impact evaluation will overestimate protection's effect. The use of matching techniques allows one to control for known landscape biases when inferring the impact of protection. Applications of matching have revealed considerably lower impact estimates of forest protection than produced by other methods. A reduction in the estimated impact from existing parks does not suggest, however, that protection is unable to lower clearing. Rather, it indicates the importance of variation across locations in how much impact protection could possibly have on rates of defo restation. Matching, then, bundles improved estimates of the average impact of protection with guidance on where new parks' impacts will be highest. While many factors will determine where new protected areas will be sited in the future, we claim that the variation across space in protection's impact on deforestation rates should inform site choice. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:40:24","2022-10-11T14:40:24Z",NA,"135–149","","Ecological Economics Reviews",1185,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Avoided deforestation; Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Effectiveness; Impact; Matching; Parks; Protected areas; Regression","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Through an engagement with the debates on the politics of scale, the argument is made that a new spatial grammar of environmental governance must be sensitive to both the politics of scale and the politics of networks. Rather than considering scalar and non-scalar interpretations of spatiality as necessarily opposite, the paper argues that through a more careful deployment of concepts of hierarchy and territory common ground between scalar and network geographies can be forged, and can inform our understanding of environmental governance. In making this argument, the paper provides an overview of contemporary configurations of global environmental governance, and seeks to illustrate by reference to one transnational municipal network, the Cities for Climate Protection programme, how governing the environment involves both political processes of scaling and rescaling the objects and agents of governance, as well as attempts to create new, networked, arenas of governance.

A meta-analysis suggests that nitrogen deposition impedes organic matter decomposition, and thus stimulates carbon sequestration, in temperate forest soils where nitrogen is not limiting microbial growth. The concomitant reduction in soil carbon emissions is substantial, and equivalent in magnitude to the amount of carbon taken up by trees owing to nitrogen fertilization.

Data screening showed 99.9% of GBIF records used outdated taxonomy and 20% had no locality coordinates.

Both datasets were used to generate range maps for each species, which were then used in preliminary Red List categorization. There was disparity in the categories of 10 species, with eight being assigned a lower threat category based on GBIF data compared with expert data, and the other two assigned a higher category. Our results suggest that before conducting desktop assessments of the threatened status of species, aggregated museum locality data should be vetted against current taxonomy and localities should be verified.

At the highest degree of spatial detail, the scenario indicators are calculated at a 0.5 by 0.5 degree resolution. All three scenarios follow the qualitative scenario characteristics, as outlined in the original SRES scenarios. Two scenarios (B1 and B2) also follow (with minor adjustments due to scenario improvements) the original SRES quantifications at the level of 4 and 11 world regions respectively. The quantification of the original SRES A2 scenario has been revised to reflect recent changing perceptions on the demographic outlook of world population growth. In this revised ""high population growth"" scenario, A2r world population reaches some 12 billion by 2100 (as opposed to some 15 billion in the original SRES A2 scenario) and is characterized by a ""delayed fertility transition"" that is also mirrored in a delayed (economic) development catch-up, resulting in an initially stagnating and subsequently only very slow reduction in income disparities. The spatially explicit scenario interpretation proceeds via two steps. Through a combination of decomposition and optimization methods, world regional scenario results are first disaggregated to the level of 185 countries. In a subsequent second step, national results are further disaggregated to a grid cell level, taking urbanization and regional (rural-urban) income disparities explicitly into account. A distinguishing feature of the spatially explicit scenario results reported here is that both methodologies, as well as numerical assumptions underlying the ""downscaling"" exercise, are scenario-dependent, leading to distinctly different spatial patterns of population and economic activities across the three scenarios examined. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here we compare two models representing contrasting degrees of abstraction of the processes governing dynamics in real vegetation. 2 Model (a) (GUESS) simulates explicitly growth and competition among individual plants. Differ- ences in crown structure (height, depth, area and LAI) influence relative light uptake by neighbours. Assimilated carbon is allocated individually by each plant to its leaf, fine root and sapwood tissues. Carbon allocation and turnover of sapwood to heartwood in turn govern height and diameter growth. 3 Model (b) (LPJ) incorporates a 'dynamic global vegetation model' (DGVM) architecture, simulating growth of populations of plant func- tional types (PFTs) over a grid cell, integrating individual-level processes over the proportional area (foliar projective cover, FPC) occupied by each PFT. Individual plants are not simulated, but are replaced by explicit parameterizations of their growth and interactions. 4 The models are identical in their representation of core physiological and biogeochemical processes. Both also use the same set of PFTs, corresponding to the major woody plant groups in Europe, plus a grass type. 5 When applied at a range of locations, broadly spanning climatic variation within Europe, both models successfully predicted PFT composition and succession within modern natural vegetation. However, the individual-based model performed better in areas where deciduous and evergreen types coincide, and in areas subject to pronounced seasonal water deficits, which would tend to favour grasses over drought-intolerant trees. 6 Differences in model performance could be traced to their treatment of individual-level processes, in par- ticular light competition and stress-induced mortality. 7 Our results suggest that an explicit individual- based approach to vegetation dynamics may be an advantage in modelling of ecosystem structure and function at the resolution required for regional- to continental-scale studies.",2001,"2022-10-11 14:40:22","2022-10-11T14:40:22Z",NA,"621–637","","6",10,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Competition; DGVM; Ecosystem model; Europe; Gap model; Mortality; Plant functional type; Succession","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the agent-based model AgriPoliS, we investigate the impact of a regime switch in agricultural policy on structural change under various framework conditions. Instead of first doing a sensitivity analysis to analyze the properties of our model and then examining the introduced policy in an isolated manner, we use a meta-modeling approach in combination with the statistical technique of Design of Experiments to systematically analyze the relationship between policy change and model assumptions regarding key determinants of structural change such as interest rates, managerial abilities, and technical change. As a result, we observe that the effects of policies are quite sensitive to the mentioned properties. We conclude that an isolated analysis of a policy regime switch would be of only minor value for policy advice given the ability of simulation models to examine various potential futures.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:40:21","2022-10-11T14:40:21Z",NA,"27 pages–27 pages","","1",11,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"agent-based modeling; agricultural policy analysis; empirical-based simulation; experimental design; farm structures; meta-modeling","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Restoration could potentially mitigate the impacts of deforestation, yet knowledge on how to efficiently allocate funding for restoration is still in its infancy. We systematically prioritize investments in restoration in the tropical landscape of East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and through this application demonstrate the capacity to account for a diverse suite of restoration techniques and forests of varying condition. To achieve this we develop a map of forest degradation for the region, characterized on the basis of aboveground biomass and differentiated by broad forest types. We estimate the costs of restoration as well as the benefits in terms of carbon sequestration and improving the suitability of habitat for threatened mammals through time. When the objective is solely to enhance carbon stocks, then restoration of highly degraded lowland forest is the most cost-effective activity. However, if the objective is to improve the habitat of threatened species, multiple forest types should be restored and this reduces the accumulated carbon by up to 24%. Our analysis framework provides a transparent method for prioritizing where and how restoration should occur in heterogeneous landscapes in order to maximize the benefits for carbon and biodiversity.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:21","2022-10-11T14:40:21Z",NA,"114020","","11",9,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"REDD+; carbon sequestration; degraded tropical forest; forest landscape restoration; restoration prioritization; threatened species; trade-offs","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Species distribution models and ecosystem models are two methodologies that are being developed to further this understanding. To date, these methodologies offer limited capa- bilities to work jointly to produce integrated assessments that take both food web dynamics and spatial-temporal environmental variability into ac- count.

The new model offers the ability to drive foraging capacity of species from the cumulative impacts of multiple physical, oceanographic, and environmental factors such as depth, bottom type, temperature, salinity, oxygen concentrations, and so on.

We reviewed basic characteristics of these aggregated and composite biodiversity indicators and evaluated them with regard to their ecological performance, policy relevance and other accounting aspects. Indices analyzed include species and populations based indicators, such as Living Planet Index and Red List Index, as well as ecosystem based indicators like Natural Capital Index and Biodiversity Intactness Index. We also include measures of ecological integrity such as Marine Trophic Index and Index of Biotic Integrity. Indicators analyzed differ in both their ecological focus, baselines, basic units or policy use. Multispecies biodiversity indices illustrate prevailingly negative trends in the state of nature as a result of human induced pressures, especially land cover change. Biodiversity loss is therefore not decoupled from socioeconomic progress. We show that current indicators include a balanced mix of important biodiversity aspects and have some policy resonance. Leading biodiversity indices should be further promoted and integrated into monitoring, modelling and decision-making frameworks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The result is a systematic map of the different approaches to the identification of the technology and policy options; different selections and definitions of the economic; social and environmental criteria under which these options should be appraised; different technical assessments of the performance of the different options under these criteria; different judgements over the patterns of uncertainty in this performance and different subjective priorities concerning the relative importance of the different criteria. In addition to providing a clear map of the differences of perspective, the study also reveals interesting and sometimes surprising areas of convergence of view. Such conclusions are all the more robust for being based on a wide variety of different perspectives.

Threats to species, habitats, and ecosystems multiply and intensify. The conservation community has invested decades of resources and hard work to reduce or eliminate these threats. However, it struggles to demonstrate that its efforts are having an impact. In recent years, conservation project managers, teams, and organizations have found themselves under increasing pressure to demonstrate measurable impacts that can be attributed to their actions. To do so, they need to answer three important questions: (1) Are we achieving our desired impact?; (2) Have we selected the best interventions to achieve our desired impact?; and (3) Are we executing our interventions in the best possible manner? We describe results chains, an important tool for helping teams clearly specify their theory of change behind the actions they are implementing. Results chains help teams make their assumptions behind an action explicit and positions the team to develop relevant objectives and indicators to monitor and evaluate whether their actions are having the intended impact. We describe this tool and how it is designed to tackle the three main questions above. We also discuss the purposes for which results chains have been used and the implications of their use. By using results chains, the conservation community can learn, adapt, and improve at a faster pace and, consequently, better address the ongoing threats to species, habitats, and ecosystems. © 2013 by the author(s).",2013,"2022-10-11 14:40:20","2022-10-11T14:40:20Z",NA,"22","","3",18,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Assumption; Effectiveness; Evaluation; Impact; Measure; Monitoring; Outcome; Planning; Results chains; Theory of change","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Poor people everywhere are eating more animal products as their incomes rise above poverty level and as they become urbanized. By 2020, the share of developing countries in total world meat consumption will expand from 52% currently to 63%. By 2020, developing countries will consume 107 million metric tons (mmt) more meat and 177 mmt more milk than they did in 1996/1998, dwarfing developed-country increases of 19 mmt for meat and 32 mmt for milk. The projected increase in livestock production will require annual feed consumption of cereals to rise by nearly 300 mmt by 2020. Nonetheless, the inflation-adjusted prices of livestock and feed commodities are expected to fall marginally by 2020, compared to precipitous declines in the past 20 y.

The aim of this paper is to bring global land cover observations closer to meeting the needs of climate science. First, consultation mechanisms were established with the climate modeling community to identify its specific requirements in terms of satellite-based global land cover products. This assessment highlighted specific needs in terms of land cover characterization, accuracy of products, as well as stability and consistency needs that are currently not met or even addressed. The current land cover representation and mapping techniques were then called into question to specifically focus on the critical need of stable products expressed by climate users. Decoupling the stable and dynamic components of the land cover characterization and using a multi-year dataset were proposed as two key approaches to allow generating consistent suites of global land cover products over time.\textless/p\textgreater",2012,"2022-10-11 14:40:19","2022-10-11T14:40:19Z",NA,"2145–2157","","6",9,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Individual PAs have different roles in maintaining connectivity, depending on their size and location. We measured their contribution to network connectivity (irreplaceability) for carnivores and ungulates and combined it with a measure of vulnerability based on a 30-year trend in remotely sensed vegetation cover (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Highly irreplaceable PAs occurred mainly in southern and eastern Africa. Vegetation cover change was generally faster outside than inside PAs and particularly so in southern Africa. The extent of change increased with the distance from PAs. About 5% of highly irreplaceable PAs experienced a faster vegetation cover loss than their surroundings, thus requiring particular conservation attention. Our analysis identified PAs at risk whose isolation would disrupt the connectivity of the PA network for large mammals.

These data, called background or pseudo-absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target-group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target-group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider, with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target-group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target-group presence records. Our approach applies to regression-based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data, such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees, and to Maxent, a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys, and possible modeling remedies, will substantially improve predictions of species distributions.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:40:17","2022-10-11T14:40:17Z",NA,"181–197","","1",19,NA,NA,"Sample selection bias and presence-only distributi",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Background data; Niche modeling; Presence-only distribution models; Pseudo-absence; Sample selection bias; Species distribution modeling; Target group","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

And yet, global health has mainly improved as these changes have gathered pace. What is the explanation? As a Commission, we are deeply concerned that the explanation is straightforward and sobering: we have been mortgaging the health of future generations to realise economic and development gains in the present. By unsustainably exploiting nature's resources, human civilisation has fl ourished but now risks substantial health eff ects from the degradation of nature's life support systems in the future. Health eff ects from changes to the environment including climatic change, ocean acidifi cation, land degradation, water scarcity, overexploitation of fi sheries, and biodiversity loss pose serious challenges to the global health gains of the past several decades and are likely to become increasingly dominant during the second half of this century and beyond. These striking trends are driven by highly inequitable, ineffi cient, and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and technological development, together with population growth. We identify three categories of challenges that have to be addressed to maintain and enhance human health in the face of increasingly harmful environmental trends. Firstly, conceptual and empathy failures (imagination challenges), such as an over-reliance on gross domestic product as a measure of human progress, the failure to account for future health and environmental harms over present day gains, and the disproportionate eff ect of those harms on the poor and those in developing nations. Secondly, knowledge failures (research and information challenges), such as failure to address social and environmental drivers of ill health, a historical scarcity of transdisciplinary research and funding, together with an unwillingness or inability to deal with uncertainty within decision making frameworks. Thirdly, implementation failures (governance challenges), such as how governments and institutions delay recognition and responses to threats, especially when faced with uncertainties, pooled common resources, and time lags between action and eff ect. Although better evidence is needed to underpin appropriate policies than is available at present, this should not be used as an excuse for inaction. Substantial potential exists to link action to reduce environmental damage with improved health outcomes for nations at all levels of economic development. This Commission identifi es opportunities for action by six key constituencies: health professionals, research funders and the academic community, the UN and Bretton Woods bodies, governments, investors and corporate reporting bodies, and civil society organisations. Depreciation of natural capital and nature's subsidy should be accounted for so that economy and nature are not falsely separated. Policies should balance social progress, environmental sustainability, and the economy. To support a world population of 9-10 billion people or more, resilient food and agricultural systems are needed to address both undernutrition and overnutrition, reduce waste, diversify diets, and minimise environmental damage. Meeting the need for modern family planning can improve health in the short termeg, from reduced maternal mortality and reduced pressures on the environment and on infrastructure. Planetary health off ers an unprecedented opportunity for advocacy of global and national reforms of taxes and subsidies for many sectors of the economy, including energy, agriculture, water, fi sheries, and health. Regional trade treaties should act to further incorporate the protection of health in the near and long term. Several essential steps need to be taken to transform the economy to support planetary health. These steps include a reduction of waste through the creation of products that are more durable and require less energy and materials to manufacture than those often produced at present; the incentivisation of recycling, reuse, and repair; and the substitution of hazardous materials with safer alternatives. Despite present limitations, the Sustainable Development Goals provide a great opportunity to integrate health and sustainability through the judicious selection of relevant indicators relevant to human wellbeing, the enabling infrastructure for development, and the supporting natural systems, together with the need for strong governance. The landscape, ecosystems, and the biodiversity they contain can be managed to protect natural systems, and indirectly, reduce human disease risk. Intact and restored ecosystems can contribute to resilience (see panel 1 for glossary of terms used in this report), for example, through improved coastal protection (eg, through wave attenuation) and the ability of fl oodplains and greening of river catchments to protect from river fl ooding events by diverting and holding excess water. The growth in urban populations emphasises the importance of policies to improve health and the urban environment, such as through reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, provision of green space, and urban planning to prevent sprawl and decrease the magnitude of urban heat islands. Transdisciplinary research activities and capacity need substantial and urgent expansion. Present research limitations should not delay action. In situations where technology and knowledge can deliver win-win solutions and co-benefi ts, rapid scale-up can be achieved if researchers move ahead and assess the implementation of potential solutions. Recent scientifi c investments towards understanding non-linear state shifts in ecosystems are very important, but in the absence of improved understanding and predictability of such changes, eff orts to improve resilience for human health and adaptation strategies remain a priority. The creation of integrated surveillance systems that collect rigorous health, socioeconomic, and environmental data for defi ned populations over long time periods can provide early detection of emerging disease outbreaks or changes in nutrition and non-communicable disease burden. The improvement of risk communication to policy makers and the public and the support of policy makers to make evidence-informed decisions can be helped by an increased capacity to do systematic reviews and the provision of rigorous policy briefs. Health professionals have an essential role in the achievement of planetary health: working across sectors to integrate policies that advance health and environmental sustainability, tackling health inequities, reducing the environmental impacts of health systems, and increasing the resilience of health systems and populations to environmental change. Humanity can be stewarded successfully through the 21st century by addressing the unacceptable inequities in health and wealth within the environmental limits of the Earth, but this will require the generation of new knowledge, implementation of wise policies, decisive action, and inspirational leadership.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:40:17","2022-10-11T14:40:17Z",NA,"1973–2028","","10007",386,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This trend is in part motivated by recognition of the need to account for global drivers of change (e.g., climate change, migration, and globalisation), the aspirations of achieving large-scale ecological goals (such as maintaining ecosystem processes), and reconciling potentially conflicting priorities in multi-use planning. However, regional-scale governance is challenging and there is little theoretical guidance or empirical evidence to suggest how it can be achieved. This paper uses the Institutional Analysis and Development framework to highlight the diverse contextual factors that challenge governance of a large-scale marine common, using an example of the Coral Triangle Initiative. The analysis points to the need for a critical, reflexive approach to the Coral Triangle Initiative if it is to effectively navigate diverse contexts and reconcile multiple objectives in the region. Recognising the heterogeneous, multi-scale and interlinked nature of large-scale marine systems is critical. Coping with contextual complexity will require innovative approaches that strive to be inclusive of varied perspectives and actors, enable and support effective collective-choice arrangements at lower levels of organisation, and organise and link diverse institutional arrangements at multiple scales. Large-scale marine governance will also involve a great deal of experimentation and regular adjustments to governance arrangements to account for the dynamic nature of regional commons. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:40:17","2022-10-11T14:40:17Z",NA,"42–53","","1",36,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Common-pool resources; Complexity; Coral Triangle; Marine governance; Regional-scale systems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Agriculture is rightly recognized as a source of considerable emissions, with concomitant opportunities for mitigation. Although future agricultural productivity is critical, as it will shape emissions from conversion of native landscapes to food and biofuel crops, investment in agricultural research is rarely mentioned as a mitigation strategy. Here we estimate the net effect on GHG emissions of historical agricultural intensification between 1961 and 2005. We find that while emissions from factors such as fertilizer production and application have increased, the net effect of higher yields has avoided emissions of up to 161 gigatons of carbon (GtC) (590 GtCO(2)e) since 1961. We estimate that each dollar invested in agricultural yields has resulted in 68 fewer kgC (249 kgCO(2)e) emissions relative to 1961 technology ($14.74/tC, or approximately $4/tCO(2)e), avoiding 3.6 GtC (13.1 GtCO(2)e) per year. Our analysis indicates that investment in yield improvements compares favorably with other commonly proposed mitigation strategies. Further yield improvements should therefore be prominent among efforts to reduce future GHG emissions.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:40:16","2022-10-11T14:40:16Z",NA,"12052–12057","","26",107,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the problem structure is split into two main components, the objective is to accomplish the feasible set framed by the system constraints. The aim of this book is expose optimization problems that can be expressed as graphs, by detailing, for each studied problem, the set of nodes and the set of edges. This graph modeling is an incentive for designing a platform that integrates all optimization components in order to output the best solution regarding the parameters' tuning. The authors propose in their analysis, for optimization problems, to provide their graphical modeling and mathematical formulation and expose some of their variants. As a solution approaches, an optimizer can be the most promising direction for limited-size instances. For large problem instances, approximate algorithms are the most appropriate way for generating high quality solutions. The authors thus propose, for each studied problem, a greedy algorithm as a problem-specific heuristic and a genetic algorithm as a metaheuristic.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:16","2022-10-11T14:40:16Z",NA,"","1–156","",9781848217430,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","New Jersey, USA","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1002/9781118984260",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways-both successful and unsuccessful-of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state.

We present a systematic reserve selection for 1223 African mammals and amphibians in which habitat suitability models are used as estimates of the area occupied by species. In the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment, we collected the geographic range (extent of occurrence) and habitat preferences for each species. We used the latter to build species-specific habitat suitability models inside geographic ranges, and for 181 species we verified the models by comparing suitability levels to presence-absence data collected in the field. We then used the suitable areas as estimators of the area of occupancy and compared the results of systematic reserve selection based on geographic ranges to those based on estimated areas of occupancy. Our results showed that the reserve system would need a 30-100% expansion to achieve minimal conservation targets, concentrated in the tropics, where species richness reaches a maximum. Comparative analyses revealed that using geographic ranges, which overestimate the area occupied by species, underestimates the total amount of area that needs to be conserved. The area selected for conservation doubled when we used the estimated area of occupancy in place of the geographic ranges. This happened because the suitable areas potentially occupied by each species overlapped less than their geographic ranges. As a result, any given protected area contained fewer species than predicted by the analysis of ranges. Because species are more specialized than our estimates of distribution based on extent of occurrence suggest, we propose that this is a general effect in systematic conservation planning.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:40:14","2022-10-11T14:40:14Z",NA,"1488–1497","","5",19,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"African amphibian; African mammal; Annealing; Complementarity; MARXAN; Protected area; Reserve selection; Systematic conservation planning","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An estimation of the level of vulnerability of each priority area allows the identification of sites that need urgent conservation action. We present a systematic reserve selection for 1654 African mammals and amphibians that uses habitat suitability models as estimates of the area occupied by each species. These are based on the geographic range and habitat preferences for each species, which we collected in the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment. Our results showed that in addition to existing protected areas, approximately 2.8 million km2 of land is irreplaceable to achieve the protection of 10% of the area occupied by all amphibians and mammals. This figure is higher than previous estimates from other studies. Most irreplaceable sites are located in the sub-Saharan region. More than half (55%) of the irreplaceable sites have high human population density; for only 17% the human population density is low. African amphibians and mammals have therefore to be conserved in densely populated areas where innovative management policies will be required to accommodate conservation successfully. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite considerable progress in identifying factors that affect the prospects for collective action, no consensus exists about the role played by heterogeneity and size of group. The debate continues in part because of a lack of uniform conceptualization of these factors, the existence of non-linear relationships, and the mediating role played by institutions. This article draws on research by scholars in the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research network which demonstrates that some forms of heterogeneity do not negatively affect some forms of collective action. More importantly, IFRI research draws out the interrelations among group size, heterogeneity, and institutions. Institutions can affect the level of heterogeneity or compensate for it. Group size appears to have a non-linear relationship to at least some forms of collective action. Moreover, group size may be as much an indicator of institutional success as a precondition for such success.",2004,"2022-10-11 14:40:12","2022-10-11T14:40:12Z",NA,"435–461","","3",35,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of the future (2005-2100) are being provided by four Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams to be used as input to the ESMs for future carbon-climate projections (Moss et al. 2010). The diversity of approaches and requirements among IAMs and ESMs for tracking land-use change, along with the dependence of model projections on land-use history, presents a challenge for effectively passing data between these communities and for smoothly transitioning from the historical estimates to future projections. Here, a harmonized set of land-use scenarios are presented that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land use with future projections, in the format required by ESMs. The land-use harmonization strategy estimates fractional land-use patterns and underlying land-use transitions annually for the time period 1500-2100 at 0.5 0.5 resolution. Inputs include new gridded historical maps of crop and pasture data from HYDE 3.1 for 1500-2005, updated estimates of historical national wood harvest and of shifting cultivation, and future information on crop, pasture, and wood harvest from the IAM implementations of the RCPs for the period 2005-2100. The computational method integrates these multiple data sources, while minimizing differences at the transition between the historical reconstruction ending conditions and IAM initial conditions, and working to preserve the future changes depicted by the IAMs at the grid cell level. This study for the first time harmonizes land-use history data together with future scenario information from multiple IAMs into a single consistent, spatially gridded, set of land-use change scenarios for studies of human impacts on the past, present, and future Earth system. 2011 The Author(s).",2011,"2022-10-11 14:40:12","2022-10-11T14:40:12Z",NA,"117–161","","1",109,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These formulations are able to account for the various sources of uncertainty and can incorporate scientific judgment in a probabilistically consistent manner. In particular, analytical diffusion models can serve as motivation for the hierarchical model for invasive species.

It has been hypothesized that most species would promote ecosystem services if many times, places, functions and environmental changes were considered; however, no previous study has considered all of these factors together. Here we show that 84% of the 147 grassland plant species studied in 17 biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species promoted ecosystem functioning during different years, at different places, for different functions and under different environmental change scenarios. Furthermore, the species needed to provide one function during multiple years were not the same as those needed to provide multiple functions within one year. Our results indicate that even more species will be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services than previously suggested by studies that have either (1) considered only the number of species needed to promote one function under one set of environmental conditions, or (2) separately considered the importance of biodiversity for providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years, places, functions or environmental change scenarios.

Agricultural land use is a main driver of global biodiversity loss. The assessment of land use impacts in decision-support tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) requires spatially explicit models, but existing approaches are either not spatially differentiated or modeled at very coarse scales (e.g., biomes or ecoregions). In this paper, we develop a high-resolution (900 m) assessment method for land use impacts on biodiversity based on habitat suitability models (HSM) of mammal species. This method considers potential land use effects on individual species, and impacts are weighted by the species' conservation status and global rarity. We illustrate the method using a case study of crop production in East Africa, but the underlying HSMs developed by the Global Mammals Assessment are available globally. We calculate impacts of three major export crops and compare the results to two previously developed methods (focusing on local and regional impacts, respectively) to assess the relevance of the methodological innovations proposed in this paper.

Such projections are so far provided almost exclusively by correlative species distribution models (correlative SDMs). However, concerns regarding the reliability of their predictive power are growing and several authors call for the development of process-based SDMs. Still, each of these methods presents strengths and weakness which have to be estimated if they are to be reliably used by decision makers. In this study we compare projections of three different SDMs (STASH, LPJ and PHENOFIT) that lie in the continuum between correlative models and process-based models for the current distribution of three major European tree species, Fagussylvatica L., Quercusrobur L. and Pinussylvestris L. We compare the consistency of the model simulations using an innovative comparison map profile method, integrating local and multi-scale comparisons. The three models simulate relatively accurately the current distribution of the three species. The process-based model performs almost as well as the correlative model, although parameters of the former are not fitted to the observed species distributions. According to our simulations, species range limits are triggered, at the European scale, by establishment and survival through processes primarily related to phenology and resistance to abiotic stress rather than to growth efficiency. The accuracy of projections of the hybrid and process-based model could however be improved by integrating a more realistic representation of the species resistance to water stress for instance, advocating for pursuing efforts to understand and formulate explicitly the impact of climatic conditions and variations on these processes.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:40:11","2022-10-11T14:40:11Z",NA,"e68823","","7",8,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We demonstrate an alternative approach to monitoring extinction risk, based on the response of species to external conditions. Using retrospective International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List assessments, we classify transitions in the extinction risk of 497 mammalian carnivores and ungulates between 1975 and 2013. Species that moved to lower Red List categories, or remained Least Concern, were classified as 'lower risk'; species that stayed in a threatened category, or moved to a higher category of risk, were classified as 'higher risk'. Twenty-four predictor variables were used to predict transitions, including intrinsic traits (species biology) and external conditions (human pressure, distribution state and conservation interventions). The model correctly classified up to 90% of all transitions and revealed complex interactions between variables, such as protected areas (PAs) versus human impact. The most important predictors were: past extinction risk, PA extent, geographical range size, body size, taxonomic family and human impact. Our results suggest that monitoring a targeted set of metrics would efficiently identify species facing a higher risk, and could guide the allocation of resources between monitoring species' extinction risk and monitoring external conditions.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:40:11","2022-10-11T14:40:11Z",NA,"20150928","","1813",282,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Human threats; Mammals; Random forest model","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Widely observed macro-ecological patterns in log abundance vs. log body mass of organisms can be explained by simple scaling theory based on food (energy) availability across a spectrum of body sizes. The theory predicts that when food availability falls with body size (as in most aquatic food webs where larger predators eat smaller prey), the scaling between log N vs. log m is steeper than when organisms of different sizes compete for a shared unstructured resource (e.g. autotrophs, herbivores and detritivores; hereafter dubbed 'detritivores'). 2. In real communities, the mix of feeding characteristics gives rise to complex food webs. Such complexities make empirical tests of scaling predictions prone to error if: (i) the data are not disaggregated in accordance with the assumptions of the theory being tested, or (ii) the theory does not account for all of the trophic interactions within and across the communities sampled. 3. We disaggregated whole community data collected in the North Sea into predator and detritivore components and report slopes of log abundance vs. log body mass relationships. Observed slopes for fish and epifaunal predator communities (-1.2 to -2.25) were significantly steeper than those for infaunal detritivore communities (-0.56 to -0.87). 4. We present a model describing the dynamics of coupled size spectra, to explain how coupling of predator and detritivore communities affects the scaling of log N vs. log m. The model captures the trophic interactions and recycling of material that occur in many aquatic ecosystems. 5. Our simulations demonstrate that the biological processes underlying growth and mortality in the two distinct size spectra lead to patterns consistent with data. Slopes of log N vs. log m were steeper and growth rates faster for predators compared to detritivores. Size spectra were truncated when primary production was too low for predators and when detritivores experienced predation pressure. 6. The approach also allows us to assess the effects of external sources of mortality (e.g. harvesting). Removal of large predators resulted in steeper predator spectra and increases in their prey (small fish and detritivores). The model predictions are remarkably consistent with observed patterns of exploited ecosystems.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:40:10","2022-10-11T14:40:10Z",NA,"270–280","","1",78,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19120607",NA,NA,NA,"Allometric scaling; Benthic-pelagic coupling; Community ecology; Ecosystem effects of fishing; Macroecology; North Sea; Size spectrum","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In nature, the ability to adapt and persist will depend on interactions between coexisting individuals. Here we use an adaptive dynamic model to assess how the potential for evolutionary rescue is affected by intra- and interspecific competition. Intraspecific competition (negative density-dependence) lowers abundance, which decreases the supply rate of beneficial mutations, hindering evolutionary rescue. On the other hand, interspecific competition can aid evolutionary rescue when it speeds adaptation by increasing the strength of selection. Our results clarify this point and give an additional requirement: competition must increase selection pressure enough to overcome the negative effect of reduced abundance. We therefore expect evolutionary rescue to be most likely in communities which facilitate rapid niche displacement. Our model, which aligns to previous quantitative and population genetic models in the absence of competition, provides a first analysis of when competitors should help or hinder evolutionary rescue.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:40:10","2022-10-11T14:40:10Z",NA,"20120085","","1610",368,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Adaptive dynamics; Competition; Environmental change; Mathematical model; Persistence","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We study how adaptation affects range shifts when it involves multiple quantitative traits evolving in response to local selection pressures and gene flow. All traits develop clines shifting in space, some of which may be in a direction opposite to univariate predictions, and the species tracks its environmental optimum with a constant lag. We provide analytical expressions for the local density and average trait values. A species can sustain faster environmental shifts, develop a wider range and greater local adaptation when spatial environmental variation is low (generating low migration load) and multitrait adaptive potential is high.

In contrast, prospects for efficiency improvements in the entire food-chain and dietary changes toward less land-demanding food have not been explored as extensively. In this study, we present model-based scenarios of global agricultural land use in 2030, as a basis for investigating the potential for land-minimized growth of world food supply through: (i) faster growth in feed-to-food efficiency in animal food production; (ii) decreased food wastage; and (iii) dietary changes in favor of vegetable food and less land-demanding meat. The scenarios are based in part on projections of global food agriculture for 2030 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO. The scenario calculations were carried out by means of a physical model of the global food and agriculture system that calculates the land area and crops/pasture production necessary to provide for a given level of food consumption.In the reference scenario - developed to represent the FAO projections - global agricultural area expands from the current 5.1. billion ha to 5.4. billion. ha in 2030. In the faster-yet-feasible livestock productivity growth scenario, global agricultural land use decreases to 4.8. billion. ha.

However, some conversion of natural cover could introduce new habitat types and allow new open habitat species to occur. Moreover, decelerating richness-area relationships suggest that, as natural area is converted to human-dominated covers, more species will be added to the rare habitat than are lost from the common one. Area effects and increased habitat diversity could each lead to a peaked relationship between species richness and the relative amount of natural area. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect on avian species richness of conversion of natural area to human-dominated land cover. Location Ontario, Canada. Methods We evaluated the responses of total avian richness, forest bird richness and open habitat bird richness to remaining natural area within 993 quadrats, each of 100 km(2). We quantified the amount of natural land cover and land-cover heterogeneity using remote sensing data. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to disentangle the relationships among avian richness, natural area and land-cover heterogeneity. Results Spatial variation in avian richness was a peaked function of remaining natural area, such that losses of up to 44% of the natural area increased avian richness. This partly reflects increased variety of land cover; however, SEM suggests that much of the increase in richness is due to pure area effects. Richness of forest species declined by two species over this range of natural cover loss while open habitat bird richness increased by approximately 20 species. The effect of natural area on species richness is consistent with the sum of species-area curves for natural habitat species and human-dominated habitat species. Main conclusions At least in northern temperate forests, almost half of the natural land cover can be converted to human-dominated forms before avian richness declines. Conversion of \textless 50% of regional natural area to human-dominated land cover can benefit open-area species richness with relatively few losses of forest obligate species.

Species' distribution modelling relies on adequate data sets to build reliable statistical models with high predictive ability. However, the money spent collecting empirical data might be better spent on management. A less expensive source of species' distribution information is expert opinion. This study evaluates expert knowledge and its source. In particular, we determine whether models built on expert knowledge apply over multiple regions or only within the region where the knowledge was derived. 2. The case study focuses on the distribution of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby Petrogale penicillata in eastern Australia. We brought together from two biogeographically different regions substantial and well-designed field data and knowledge from nine experts. We used a novel elicitation tool within a geographical information system to systematically collect expert opinions. The tool utilized an indirect approach to elicitation, asking experts simpler questions about observable rather than abstract quantities, with measures in place to identify uncertainty and offer feedback. Bayesian analysis was used to combine field data and expert knowledge in each region to determine: (i) how expert opinion affected models based on field data and (ii) how similar expert-informed models were within regions and across regions. 3. The elicitation tool effectively captured the experts' opinions and their uncertainties. Experts were comfortable with the map-based elicitation approach used, especially with graphical feedback. Experts tended to predict lower values of species occurrence compared with field data. 4. Across experts, consensus on effect sizes occurred for several habitat variables. Expert opinion generally influenced predictions from field data. However, south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales experts had different opinions on the influence of elevation and geology, with these differences attributable to geological differences between these regions. 5. Synthesis and applications. When formulated as priors in Bayesian analysis, expert opinion is useful for modifying or strengthening patterns exhibited by empirical data sets that are limited in size or scope. Nevertheless, the ability of an expert to extrapolate beyond their region of knowledge may be poor. Hence there is significant merit in obtaining information from local experts when compiling species' distribution models across several regions. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:40:09","2022-10-11T14:40:09Z",NA,"842–851","","4",46,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bayesian; Elicitation; Expert knowledge; Extrapolation; Model transferability; Spatial habitat modelling","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we attempt to quantify the contribution of hurricanes to Caribbean coral cover decline over the past two decades using meta-analyses. Our study included published and unpublished data from 286 coral reef sites monitored for variable lengths of time between 1980 and 2001. Of these, 177 sites had experienced hurricane impacts during their period of survey. Across the Caribbean, coral cover is reduced by ∼17%, on average, in the year following a hurricane impact. T he magnitude of this immediate loss increases with hurricane intensity and with the time elapsed since the last impact. In the following year, no further loss is discernible, but the decline in cover then resumes on impacted sites at a rate similar to the regional background rate of decline for nonimpacted sites. There is no evidence of recovery to a pre-storm state for at least eight years after impact. Overall, coral cover at sites impacted by a hurricane has declined at a significantly faster rate (6% per annum) than nonimpacted sites (2% per annum), due almost exclusively to higher rates of loss in the year after impact in the 1980s. While hurricanes, through their immediate impacts, appear to have contributed to changing coral cover on many Caribbean reefs in the 1980s, the similar decline in coral cover at impacted and nonimpacted sites in the 1990s suggests that other stressors are now relatively more important in driving the overall pattern of change in coral cover in this region. The overall lack of post-hurricane recovery points to a general impairment of the regeneration potential of Caribbean coral reefs.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:40:08","2022-10-11T14:40:08Z",NA,"174–184","","1",86,NA,NA,"HURRICANES AND CARIBBEAN CORAL REEFS",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Caribbean coral reefs; Conservation; Coral decline; Disturbance; Hurricanes; Large-scale patterns; Temporal trends","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article provides a methodological framework for identifying local development capital using scenario storylines, maps and visualisations of possible development outcomes to prompt discussion with local stakeholders about regional potentials. Result from a case study in Northern Portugal show that these tools are particularly suited to gaining a richer understanding of development assets and constraints and for providing insight in the role of spatial variation within regions, which is rarely addressed in scenario studies.

Incentive interactions had complex effects-characterized by synergies and tensions, non-linearity, dependencies, and thresholds. Tensions occurred between commodity price and carbon price in supplying food and fiber, carbon sequestration, fresh water, and indirectly, habitat services. Water price displayed synergies with commodity price, and tensions with carbon price in supplying fresh water services. For the supply of habitat services, a biodiversity price depended on either high carbon prices or low commodity prices.

All rights reserved.Public concern over biodiversity loss is often rationalized as a threat to ecosystem functioning, but biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relations are hard to empirically quantify at large scales. We use a realistic marine food-web model, resolving species over five trophic levels, to study how total fish production changes with species richness. This complex model predicts that BEF relations, on average, follow simple Michaelis-Menten curves when species are randomly deleted. These are shaped mainly by release of fish from predation, rather than the release from competition expected from simpler communities. Ordering species deletions by decreasing body mass or trophic level, representing 'fishing down the food web', accentuates prey-release effects and results in unimodal relationships. In contrast, simultaneous unselective harvesting diminishes these effects and produces an almost linear BEF relation, with maximum multispecies fisheries yield at ?40% of initial species richness.

Scenarios for high-, medium- and low-density urban areas are simulated using a dynamic agro-ecosystem model (Agro-IBIS), by incorporating new parameterizations for impervious surfaces and turf grass. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m albedo data and remote sensing-derived 30-m resolution maps from the U.S. National Land Cover Database are used as model input to simulate biogeochemical, thermodynamic, and hydrological cycles for a range of land-cover types in each region. The results show that the expanding urban areas have a significant impact on each city's capacity to regulate climate and flooding. High-density urban areas, for instance, have soil surface temperatures up to 6A degrees C higher than soils within natural and managed ecosystems. Expansion of turf grass in residential areas could require an additional 8-105 million m(3) of water use annually, which increases runoff by 15-48% and reduces the capacity to respond/adapt to flooding. Finally, the analysis shows that net primary productivity (NPP) decreases as expected due to the removal of cropland, forests, and grasslands in favor of development, but increased urban turf grass provides an annual offset of 40-210 g C m(-2). Urban expansion through 2030 is estimated to lower total annual crop production by 8.1, 8.6, and 16.7% for the Madison, Peoria, and Indianapolis regions, respectively. Given current projections for city growth to exceed 2-3% per year in the north-central U.S., urban expansion across a nine-state region in the Corn Belt could potentially take an additional 210,000-310,000 ha of farmland out of production annually at a time when demand for food, fuel, and fiber is increasing.

We summarize the results of 44 experiments that have manipulated the richness of plants to examine how plant diversity affects the production of biomass. We show that mixtures of species produce an average of 1.7 times more biomass than species monocultures and are more productive than the average monoculture in 79% of all experiments. However, in only 12% of all experiments do diverse polycultures achieve greater biomass than their single most productive species. Previously, a positive net effect of diversity that is no greater than the most productive species has been interpreted as evidence for selection effects, which occur when diversity maximizes the chance that highly productive species will be included in and ultimately dominate the biomass of polycultures. Contrary to this, we show that although productive species do indeed contribute to diversity effects, these contributions are equaled or exceeded by species complementarity, where biomass is augmented by biological processes that involve multiple species. Importantly, both the net effect of diversity and the probability of polycultures being more productive than their most productive species increases through time, because the magnitude of complementarity increases as experiments are run longer.

Complex problems often result from the multiple interactions between human activities and ecosystems. The interconnected nature of ecological and social systems should be considered if these “wicked problems” are to be addressed. Ecosystem service approaches provide an opportunity to link ecosystem function with social values, but in practice the essential role that social dynamics play in the delivery of outcomes remains largely unexplored. Social factors such as management regimes, power relationships, skills, and values, can dramatically affect the definition and delivery of ecosystem services. Input from a diverse group of stakeholders improves the capacity of ecosystem service approaches to address wicked problems by acknowledging diverse sets of values and accounting for conflicting world views. Participatory modeling can incorporate both social and ecological dynamics into decision making that involves stakeholders, but is itself a complex social undertaking that may not yield precise or predictable outcomes. We explore the efficacy of different types of participatory modeling in relation to the integration of social values into ecosystem services frameworks and the generation of four important elements of social capital needed to address wicked problems: enhancing social learning and capacity building; increasing transparency; mediating power; and building trust. Our findings indicate that mediated modeling, group mapping, and mental/conceptual modeling are likely to generate elements of social capital that can improve ecosystem service frameworks. Participatory simulation, system dynamic modeling, and Bayesian belief networks, if utilized in isolation, were found to have a low likelihood of generating the social capital needed to improve ecosystem services frameworks. Scenario planning, companion modeling, group model building, and participatory mapping all generate a moderate to high level of social capital elements that improve the capacity of ecosystem service frameworks to address wicked problems.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:40:04","2022-10-11T14:40:04Z",NA,"","","2",20,NA,NA,"Improving ecosystem service frameworks to address",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem services; Participatory modeling; Social capital; Social values; Wicked problems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

East Africa is one of few tropical regions where general circulation model (GCM) future climate projections exhibit a robust response of strong future warming and general annual-mean rainfall increases. Eighteen future climate projections from nine GCMs participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment were used as input to the LPJ dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), which predicted vegetation patterns and carbon storage in agreement with satellite observations and forest inventory data under the present-day climate. All simulations showed future increases in tropical woody vegetation over the region at the expense of grasslands. Regional increases in net primary productivity (NPP) (18-36%) and total carbon storage (3-13%) by 2080-2099 compared with the present-day were common to all simulations. Despite decreases in soil carbon after 2050, seven out of nine simulations continued to show an annual net land carbon sink in the final decades of the 21st century because vegetation biomass continued to increase. The seasonal cycles of rainfall and soil moisture show future increases in wet season rainfall across the GCMs with generally little change in dry season rainfall. Based on the simulated present-day climate and its future trends, the GCMs can be grouped into four broad categories. Overall, our model results suggest that East Africa, a populous and economically poor region, is likely to experience some ecosystem service benefits through increased precipitation, river runoff and fresh water availability. Resulting enhancements in NPP may lead to improved crop yields in some areas. Our results stand in partial contradiction to other studies that suggest possible negative consequences for agriculture, biodiversity and other ecosystem services caused by temperature increases.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:40:04","2022-10-11T14:40:04Z",NA,"617–640","","2",16,NA,NA,"Implications of future climate and atmospheric CO2",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Climate uncertainty; DGVM; Dynamic global vegetation models; East Africa; Ecosystem services; General circulation models; Regional climate impacts","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite efforts in data collection, missing values are commonplace in life-history trait databases. Because these values typically are not missing randomly, the common practice of removingmissing data not only reduces sample size, but also introduces bias that can lead to incorrect conclusions. Imputingmissing values is a potential solution to this problem. Here, we evaluate the performance of four approaches for estimating missing values in trait databases (K-nearest neighbour (kNN), multivariate imputation by chained equations (mice), missForest and Phylopars), and testwhether imputed datasets retain underlying allometric relationships among traits. 2. Starting with a nearly complete trait dataset on the mammalian order Carnivora (using four traits), we artificially removed values so that the percent ofmissing values ranged from 10% to 80%. Using the original values as a reference, we assessed imputation performance using normalized root mean squared error.We also evaluated whether including phylogenetic information improved imputation performance in kNN, mice, and missForest (it is a required input in Phylopars). Finally, we evaluated the extent to which the allometric relationship between two traits (body mass and longevity) was conserved for imputed datasets by looking at the difference (bias) between the slope of the original and the imputed datasets or datasets with missing values removed. 3. Three of the tested approaches (mice, missForest and Phylopars), resulted in qualitatively equivalent imputation performance, and all had significantly lower errors than kNN. Adding phylogenetic information into the imputation algorithms improved estimation of missing values for all tested traits. The allometric relationship between body mass and longevity was conserved when up to 60% of data were missing, either with or without phylogenetic information, depending on the approach. This relationship was less biased in imputed datasets compared to datasets withmissing values removed, especially whenmore than 30%of values weremissing. 4. Imputations provide valuable alternatives to removing missing observations in trait databases as they produce low errors and retain relationships among traits. Although we must continue to prioritize data collection on species traits, imputations can provide a valuable solution for conducting macroecological and evolutionary studies using life-history trait databases.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:40:03","2022-10-11T14:40:03Z",NA,"1–10","","9",5,NA,NA,"Imputation of missing data in life-history trait d",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Body mass; Carnivores; KNN; Longevity; MissForest; Multivariate imputation by chained equations; Phylogeny; Phylopars; Rootmean squared error","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reasons for this are that (1) there is presently no means for quantifying the relative effects of landscape stochasticity and population stochasticity on model outputs, and therefore no means for determining how to allocate simulation time optimally between the two; and (2) the process of generating multiple landscapes to incorporate landscape stochasticity is tedious and user-intensive with current PVA software. Here we demonstrate that landscape stochasticity can be an important source of variance in model outputs. We solve the technical problems with incorporating landscape stochasticity by deriving a formula that gives the optimal ratio of population simulations to landscape simulations for a given model, and by providing a computer program that incorporates the formula and automates multiple landscape generation in a dynamic landscape metapopulation (DLMP) model. Using a case study of a bird population, we produce estimates of DLMP model output parameters that are up to four times more precise than those estimated from a single landscape in the same amount of total simulation time. We use the DLMP modeling software RAMAS Landscape to run the landscape and metapopulation models, though our method is general and could be applied to any PVA platform.

Adaptive management, defined as the integration of design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions to learn and adapt, provides practitioners a method for improving strategies to achieve and sustain the desired conservation impact. The Conservation Measures Partnership, a joint venture of conservation NGOs, developed the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation, a freely available framework that guides practitioners through implementation of best conservation practices. Using this process, project teams are explicit about the assumptions behind the strategies they choose, and thus able to trace their successes and failures back to good or poor theory, implementation, or a combination of the two. The Open Standards comprise five steps that constitute the project management cycle: (1) Conceptualize what you will achieve in the context of where you are working–involves defining your project team, scope, vision, conservation targets, critical threats, and analyzing the situation; (2) Plan your actions and monitoring–involves developing an action plan including goals, strategies, assumptions, objectives, and activities; a monitoring plan including indicators for measuring the status of goals, objectives, and assumptions; and an operational plan specifying the resources needed; (3) Implement your actions and monitoring–includes developing and implementing detailed work plans and ensuring sufficient resources, capacity, and partners; (4) Analyze, use, and adapt–involves managing monitoring data, regular analysis to convert them to useful information, and adapting the project plans accordingly; and (5) Capture and share learning–involves sharing lessons with key external and internal audiences to promote a learning culture.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:40:02","2022-10-11T14:40:02Z",NA,"425–440","","5",72,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Conservation; Evaluation; Planning; Project conceptualization","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Climatic changes were identified as a key driver behind this increase, yet how the expected continuation of climate change will affect Europe's forest disturbance regime remains unresolved. Increasing disturbances could strongly impact the forest carbon budget, and are suggested to contribute to the recently observed carbon sink saturation in Europe's forests. Here we show that forest disturbance damage in Europe has continued to increase in the first decade of the twenty-first century. On the basis of an ensemble of climate change scenarios we find that damage from wind, bark beetles and forest fires is likely to increase further in coming decades, and estimate the rate of increase to be +0.91 × 10 6 m 3 of timber per year until 2030. We show that this intensification can offset the effect of management strategies aiming to increase the forest carbon sink, and calculate the disturbance-related reduction of the carbon storage potential in Europe's forests to be 503.4 Tg C in 2021-2030. Our results highlight the considerable carbon cycle feedbacks of changing disturbance regimes, and underline that future forest policy and management will require a stronger focus on disturbance risk and resilience.© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Predictions from these models inform conservation policy, invasive species management and disease-control measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty, focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models, demographic models and process-based models. We identify sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling process to give realistic measures of confidence around predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions of geographical distribution. We identify areas where development of new statistical tools will improve predictions from distribution models, notably the development of hierarchical models that link different types of distribution model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of model covariates.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:40:02","2022-10-11T14:40:02Z",NA,"247–258","","1586",367,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bioclimate envelope; Climate impacts; Distribution model; Niche model; Process-based model; Spatial analysis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The results are used to identify species that need further protection, providing a quantitative baseline to address a possible expansion of a given protected area (PA) systems. However, the achievement of the same representation target may have different implications in terms of species persistence depending on population spatial structure and conservation needs. The aim was to investigate to what extent and why gap analysis may provide inequitable assessments of species protection. Location Europe. Methods We performed three gap analyses on 27 European species of carnivores and ungulates, measuring the level of protection according to three different types of distribution data: geographical ranges, habitat suitability models and habitat suitability models that incorporate the potential spatial structuring in populations within PAs. Results The estimated degree of species protection depends on the distribution proxy and the target adopted. When the analyses are based on areas able to support viable populations (irrespective of how these areas are quantified), the perceived relative protection of different species changes considerably. The ability of different species to persist in PA systems mostly depends on their population density and dispersal abilities, as well as the interaction between these two features, which eventually determines the number and relative size of the populations. Main conclusions The achievement of the same representation target for different species may imply protecting different numbers of individuals in populations having different spatial structures and may consequently lead to different probabilities of persistence across species.

Although the delivery of ecosystem services is strongly affected by abiotic drivers and direct land use effects, it is also modulated by the functional diversity of biological communities (the value, range, and relative abundance of functional traits in a given ecosystem). The focus of this article is on integrating the different possible mechanisms by which functional diversity affects ecosystem properties that are directly relevant to ecosystem services. We propose a systematic way for progressing in understanding how land cover change affects these ecosystem properties through functional diversity modifications. Models on links between ecosystem properties and the local mean, range, and distribution of plant trait values are numerous, but they have been scattered in the literature, with varying degrees of empirical support and varying functional diversity components analyzed. Here we articulate these different components in a single conceptual and methodological framework that allows testing them in combination. We illustrate our approach with examples from the literature and apply the proposed framework to a grassland system in the central French Alps in which functional diversity, by responding to land use change, alters the provision of ecosystem services important to local stakeholders.

The criteria are tested using 24 indicators of ecosystem assessment and monitoring at the global, continental and regional scale.

We review our ecological understanding of wildlife infectious diseases from the individual host to the ecosystem scale, highlighting where conceptual thinking lacks verification, discussing difficulties and challenges, and offering potential future research directions. 2. New molecular approaches hold potential to increase our understanding of parasite interactions within hosts. Also, advances in our knowledge of immune systems makes immunological parameters viable measures of parasite exposure, and useful tools for improving our understanding of causal mechanisms. 3. Studies of transmission dynamics have revealed the importance of heterogeneity in host behaviour and physiology, and of contact processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. An important future challenge is to determine the key transmission mechanisms maintaining the persistence of different types of diseases in the wild. 4. Regulation of host populations is too complex to consider parasite effects in isolation from other factors. One solution is to seek a unified understanding of the conditions under which (and the ecological rules determining when) population scale impacts of parasites can occur. 5. Good evidence now shows that both direct effects of parasites, and trait mediated indirect effects, frequently mediate the success of invasive species and their impacts on recipient communities. A wider exploration of these effects is now needed. 6. At the ecosystem scale, research is needed to characterize the circumstances and conditions under which both fluxes in parasite biomass, and trait mediated effects, are significant in ecosystem processes, and to demonstrate that parasites do indeed increase 'ecosystem health'. 7. There is a general need for more empirical testing of predictions and subsequent development of theory in the classic research cycle. Experimental field studies, meta-analyses, the collection and analysis of long-term data sets, and data constrained modelling, will all be key to advancing our understanding. 8. Finally, we are only now beginning to understand the importance of cross-scale interactions associated with parasitism. Such interactions may offer key insights into bigger picture questions such as when and how different regulatory factors are important, when disease can cause species extinctions, and what characteristics are indicative of functionally resilient ecosystems.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:40:00","2022-10-11T14:40:00Z",NA,"19–38","","1",80,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Animal; Animal Diseases; Animals; Host-Parasite Interactions; Parasites; Parasitic Diseases; Population Dynamics; Wild","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some indigenous groups manipulate the local landscape to augment its heterogeneity, and some have been found to be motivated to restore biodiversity in degraded landscapes. Their practices for the conservation of biodiversity were grounded in a series of rules of thumb which are apparently arrived at through a trial and error process over a long historical time period.

Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an EAF. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an EAF will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and response indicators, the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and response indicators may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and response indicators would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:40:00","2022-10-11T14:40:00Z",NA,"212–232","","3",6,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem approach; Fisheries management; Fishing effects; Indicators; Power analysis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While we believe that TEK and Western science are complementary, the inclusion of TEK in climate science and politics has been uneven. In support of our argument, we present a framework for assessment of degrees of inclusion of TEK and apply the framework to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA). We find that the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol do not account for either indigenous peoples or indigenous people's knowledges. The AR4 includes some references to indigenous peoples but they are often buried in regional chapters. The ACIA is the most inclusive of all the documents examined and represents an important starting point for the inclusion of IKs.

Diagnosing the processes that threaten species persistence is critical for recovery planning and risk forecasting. Dominant threats are typically inferred by experts on the basis of a patchwork of informal methods. Transparent, quantitative diagnostic tools would contribute much-needed consistency, objectivity, and rigor to the process of diagnosing anthropogenic threats. Long-term census records, available for an increasingly large and diverse set of taxa, may exhibit characteristic signatures of specific threatening processes and thereby provide information for threat diagnosis. We developed a flexible Bayesian framework for diagnosing threats on the basis of long-term census records and diverse ancillary sources of information. We tested this framework with simulated data from artificial populations subjected to varying degrees of exploitation and habitat loss and several real-world abundance time series for which threatening processes are relatively well understood: bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) (exploitation) and Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) and Eurasian Skylark (Alauda arvensis) (habitat loss). Our method correctly identified the process driving population decline for over 90% of time series simulated under moderate to severe threat scenarios. Successful identification of threats approached 100% for severe exploitation and habitat loss scenarios. Our method identified threats less successfully when threatening processes were weak and when populations were simultaneously affected by multiple threats. Our method selected the presumed true threat model for all real-world case studies, although results were somewhat ambiguous in the case of the Eurasian Skylark. In the latter case, incorporation of an ancillary source of information (records of land-use change) increased the weight assigned to the presumed true model from 70% to 92%, illustrating the value of the proposed framework in bringing diverse sources of information into a common rigorous framework. Ultimately, our framework may greatly assist conservation organizations in documenting threatening processes and planning species recovery.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:39:59","2022-10-11T14:39:59Z",NA,"238–249","","1",29,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bayesian model selection; Conservation planning; Declining-population paradigm; Long-term monitoring; Population viability analysis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is likely to comprehensively assess such projections, yet despite being widely used and potentially critical tools for analysing socio-environmental futures, integrated assessment models (IAMs) have received little attention from ecological modellers. We aim to raise awareness and understanding of IAMs among ecologists by describing the structure and composition of IAMs, assessing their utility for biodiversity projections and identifying limitations that hamper greater interaction between scientists using IAMs and those using ecological models. We also hope to inspire more accessible and applicable models by suggesting development needs for IAMs. MethodsWe conduct a systematic review of four state-of-the-art IAMs, which describes and contrasts key model features and analyses six aspects of IAMs that are of fundamental interest to ecologists. ConclusionsIAMs could be valuable for modelling biodiversity futures; however, current IAMs were not developed for this application and challenges remain for ecologists looking to use their outputs. Separating and understanding the differences resulting from IAM formulation and those resulting from specific scenario assumptions is currently problematic, and current IAMs may be unable to accurately represent environmental conditions for both Earth-system projections and for building robust models of biodiversity because key ecological processes are absent. We suggest that model intercomparisons would identify differences in model dynamics, and detailed studies of how dynamical interactions between components influence behaviour would address why such differences arise. Bio-economic fisheries models and agriculture pollination models provide starting points for integrating key ecological feedbacks within IAMs. Ultimately, making IAMs more accessible within the multidisciplinary study of global change, drawing on user-centred research, would enable more resolved, reliable and accurate assessment of how Earth's socio-ecological system is approaching planetary boundaries.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:59","2022-10-11T14:39:59Z",NA,"124–143","","2",23,NA,NA,"Integrated assessment models for ecologists: the p",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"AIM; GCAM; IMAGE; Integrated assessment models; Land-cover projections; Land-use projections; MESSAGE; Scenarios","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Local government decision makers are still unsure of the applicability, return on investment, and usefulness of these assessments in aiding their decision making. Cape Town, a developing city in a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot, has numerous competing land uses. City managers, with a tightly constrained budget, requested an exploratory study on the links between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation within this municipal area. We set out to develop and test a simple and rapid ecosystem service assessment method aimed at determining the contribution natural vegetation remnants make to ecosystem service provision. We took selected services, identified in conjunction with city managers, and assessed these in two ways. First we used an area weighted approach to attribute services to vegetation types and assessed how these had changed through time and into the future given development needs. Second, we did a regulatory and cultural service remnant distance analysis to better understand proximity effects and linkages. Provisioning services were found to have been most severely affected through vegetation transformation. Regulatory services have been similarly affected, and these losses are more significant because regulatory services can only function in situ and cannot be outsourced in the way provisioning services can. The most significant losses were in coastal zone protection and flood mitigation services, both of which will be placed under even greater pressure given the predicted changes in climatic regimes. The role of remnant vegetation in regulating and cultural services was shown to be a significant additional consideration in making the case for conservation in the city. Our rapid assessment approach does not allow for nuanced and individual understanding of the trade-offs presented by individual remnant patches, but is particularly strong in quickly identifying issues, key focus areas, and opportunities provided by this research direction, and thereby serving to facilitate and drive constructive engagement between ecosystem service experts and city planners. © 2012 by the author(s).",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:59","2022-10-11T14:39:59Z",NA,"","","3",17,NA,NA,"Insights and Opportunities Offered by a Rapid Ecos",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cape town; Ecosystem service tool; Historical change; Scenario modeling; Scoping; Urban ecology","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given projections for agriculture, more modeling is needed on feedbacks between agricultural expansion on rangelands and water supply.Objectives: To understand the potential impacts to rangeland ecosystem services, we developed six spatially explicit (250 m) climate/land use change scenarios for the Central Valley of California and surrounding foothills consistent with three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenario narratives.Methods: We quantified baseline and projected change in wildlife habitat, soil organic carbon (SOC), and water supply (recharge and runoff). For six case study watersheds we quantified the interactions of future development and changing climate on recharge, runoff and streamflow, and precipitation thresholds where dominant watershed hydrological processes shift through analysis of covariance.Results: The scenarios show that across the region, habitat loss is expected to occur predominantly in grasslands, primarily due to future development (up to a 37 % decline by 2100), however habitat loss in priority conservation errors will likely be due to cropland and hay/pasture expansion (up to 40 % by 2100). Grasslands in the region contain approximately 100 teragrams SOC in the top 20 cm, and up to 39 % of this SOC is subject to conversion by 2100. In dryer periods recharge processes typically dominate runoff. Future development lowers the precipitation value at which recharge processes dominate runoff, and combined with periods of drought, reduces the opportunity for recharge, especially on deep soils.Context: In addition to biodiversity conservation, California rangelands generate multiple ecosystem services including livestock production, drinking and irrigation water, and carbon sequestration. California rangeland ecosystems have experienced substantial conversion to residential land use and more intensive agriculture.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:39:58","2022-10-11T14:39:58Z",NA,"729–750","","4",30,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change adaptation; Downscaled global climate models; Ecosystem services; Grassland; Land use/land cover change scenarios; Rangeland; Soil carbon; Water supply","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this review, I argue that all these governance struc- tures fail under certain conditions.However, the factors contributing to failure in each of these institutional forms differ radically, and the causes of that failure are not always predicted on the basis of exist- ing theory. This chapter contains a review of the literature on the factors identified as causing the failure of private-property regimes, government-controlled resources, and local-level management.We will have to learn to match the resource problems with governance institutions and specific management techniques if we are to manage resources effectively.We also will have to understand the complex biosocial factors influencing sustainability. 117",2006,"2022-10-11 14:39:58","2022-10-11T14:39:58Z",NA,"117–134","","1",35,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, in contrast to other industries, innovations in health care have not tended to reduce the need for labor. In fact, labor still accounts for the largest proportion of expenditures in many health systems. But labor-saving technologies, workforce innovations, and patient self-care approaches are now emerging and altering health care's labor structure. For example, in Mexico more than one million households pay $\backslash$$5 per month to access a health advice hotline before setting foot in a physician's office. In India assembly line-style eye surgery has dramatically reduced cost without sacrificing quality. Policy makers should focus on such labor-saving innovations; reform reimbursement systems to encourage them; tackle professionals' resistance; and remove regulatory barriers.

Agricultural technologies and agricultural, environmental and rural development policies are increasingly designed to contribute to the sustainability of agricultural systems and to enhance contributions of agricultural systems to sustainable development at large. The effectiveness and efficiency of such policies and technological developments in realizing desired contributions could be greatly enhanced if the quality of their ex-ante assessments were improved. Four key challenges and requirements to make research tools more useful for integrated assessment in the European Union were defined in interactions between scientists and the European Commission (EC), i.e., overcoming the gap between micro-macro level analysis, the bias in integrated assessments towards either economic or environmental issues, the poor re-use of models and hindrances in technical linkage of models. Tools for integrated assessment must have multi-scale capabilities and preferably be generic and flexible such that they can deal with a broad variety of policy questions. At the same time, to be useful for scientists, the framework must facilitate state-of-the-art science both on aspects of the agricultural systems and on integration. This paper presents the rationale, design and illustration of a component-based framework for agricultural systems (SEAMLESS Integrated Framework) to assess, ex-ante, agricultural and agri-environmental policies and technologies across a range of scales, from field-farm to region and European Union, as well as some global interactions. We have opted for a framework to link individual model and data components and a software infrastructure that allows a flexible (re-)use and linkage of components. The paper outlines the software infrastructure, indicators and model and data components. The illustrative example assesses effects of a trade liberalisation proposal on EU's agriculture and indicates how SEAMLESS addresses the four identified challenges for integrated assessment tools, i.e., linking micro and macro analysis, assessing economic, environmental, social and institutional indicators, (re-)using standalone model components for field, farm and market analysis and their conceptual and technical linkage. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of the potential effects of federal land management on aquatic ecosystems across this region is an important but challenging task. Issues include the size and complexity of the systems, uncertainty in important processes and existing states, flexibility and consistency in the analytical framework, and an ability to quantify results. We focused on salmonid fishes and their habitats as indicators of conditions in aquatic ecosystems and used Bayesian belief networks as a formal, quantitative framework to address the issues in our evaluation of land management alternatives proposed for the interior Columbia River basin. Because empirical information is limited at the scales relevant to our analysis, an ability to combine both empirical and more subjective information was key to the analysis. The representation of linkages through conditional probabilities made uncertainty explicit. We constructed two general networks. One represented the influence of landscape characteristics and existing and predicted management activities on aquatic habitats. A second represented the influence of habitat, existing biotic conditions, and for two anadromous species, ocean and migratory conditions, on the status of six widely distributed salmonid fishes. In the long term (100 years) all three land management alternatives were expected to produce positive changes in the status and distribution of the salmonids and their habitats. Trends were stronger for habitat than for the status of salmonids because of greater uncertainty in linking the fish and habitat networks and constraints outside spawning and rearing habitat on federal lands in the study area. Trends were stronger for resident salmonids than anadromous forms because of additional effects of the migratory corridor assumed for the latter. Alternative S2, which approached ecosystem restoration more conservatively, generally produced the strongest positive changes, and alternative S3, designed to promote more aggressive restoration, the weakest. Averaged across the basin, differences among the alternatives were small. Differences were greater at finer temporal and spatial scales. In the short term (10 years) alternative S3 was expected to lead to further degradation in some areas. By formalizing our understanding and assumptions in these networks, we provided a framework for exploring differences in the management alternatives that is more quantifiable, spatially explicit, and flexible than previous approaches.",2001,"2022-10-11 14:39:57","2022-10-11T14:39:57Z",NA,"43–62","","1-3",153,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic habitat; Bayesian belief network; Columbia River basin; Fish; Salmon; Trout","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ten plants functional types (PFTs) are differentiated by physiological, morphological, phenological, bioclimatic and fire-response attributes. Resource competition and differential responses to fire between PFTs influence their relative fractional cover from year to year. Photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics are modelled on a daily time step, while vegetation structure and PFT population densities are updated annually. Simulations have been made over the industrial period both for specific sites where field measurements were available for model evaluation, and globally on a 0.5°° × 0.5°° grid. Modelled vegetation patterns are consistent with observations, including remotely sensed vegetation structure and phenology. Seasonal cycles of net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture compare well with local measurements.

If reefs become stuck' within a self-reinforcing state dominated by seaweed, it becomes disproportionately difficult and expensive for managers to shift the system back towards its natural, productive, coral state. The existence of multiple attractors is controversial. We assess various forms of evidence and conclude that there remains no incontrovertible proof of multiple attractors on reefs. However, the most compelling evidence, which combines ecological models and field data, is far more consistent with multiple attractors than the competing hypothesis of only a single, coral attractor. Managers should exercise caution and assume that degraded reefs can become stuck there. Testing for the existence of alternate attractors in ecosystems that possess slow dynamics and frequent pulse perturbation is exceptionally challenging. Coral reefs typify such conditions and the existence of alternate attractors is controversial. We analyse different forms of evidence and assess whether they support or challenge the existence of multiple attractors on Caribbean reefs, many of which have shown profound phase shifts in community structure from coral to algal dominance. Field studies alone provide no insight into multiple attractors because the non-equilibrial nature of reef dynamics prevents equilibria from being observed. Statistical models risk failing to sample the parameter space in which multiple attractors occur, and have failed to account for the confounding effects of heterogeneous environments, anthropogenic drivers (e.g. fishing), and major disturbances (e.g. hurricanes). Simple and complex models all find multiple attractors over some though not all regions of a system driver (fishing). Tests of model predictions with field data closely match theory of alternate attractors but a forward-leaning monotonic curve with only a single attractor can also be fitted to these data. Deeper consideration of the assumptions of this monotonic relationship reveal significant ecological problems which disappear under a model of multiple attractors. To date, there is no evidence against the existence of multiple attractors on Caribbean reefs and while there remains no definitive proof, the balance of evidence and ecological reasoning favours their existence. Theory predicts that Caribbean reefs do not exhibit alternate attractors in their natural state but that disease-induced loss of two key functional groups has generated bistability. Whether alternate attractors becomes a persistent element of reef dynamics or a brief moment in their geological history will depend, in part, on the ability of functional groups to recover and the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on coral growth and mortality.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:39:57","2022-10-11T14:39:57Z",NA,"481–491","","4",122,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast 'climate analogue model', based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494 Pg C among DGVMs over the 21st century.

The cost of natural selection expresses the limited capacity of a population to sustain the load of mortality or sterility required for effective selection. Genostasis expresses the lack of variation that prevents many populations from adapting to stress. While the role of relative fitness in adaptation is well understood, evolutionary rescue emphasizes the need to recognize explicitly the importance of absolute fitness. Permanent adaptation requires a range of genetic variation in absolute fitness that is broad enough to provide a few extreme types capable of sustained growth under a stress that would cause extinction if they were not present. This principle implies that population size is an important determinant of rescue. The overall number of individuals exposed to selection will be greater when the population declines gradually under a constant stress, or is progressively challenged by gradually increasing stress. In gradually deteriorating environments, survival at lethal stress may be procured by prior adaptation to sublethal stress through genetic correlation.

However, natural selection imposes demographic costs on a population, and if these costs are sufficiently large, the likelihood of extinction will be high. We consider how the mean time to extinction depends on selective pressures (rate and stochasticity of environmental change, and strength of selection), population parameters (carrying capacity, and reproductive capacity), and genetics (rate of polygenic mutation). We assume that in a randomly mating, finite population subject to density-dependent population growth, individual fitness is determined by a single quantitative-genetic character under Gaussian stabilizing selection with the optimum phenotype exhibiting directional change, or random fluctuations, or both. The quantitative trait is determined by a finite number of freely recombining, mutationally equivalent, additive loci. The dynamics of evolution and extinction are investigated, assuming that the population is initially under mutation-selection-drift balance. Under this model, in a directionally changing environment, the mean phenotype tags behind the optimum, but on the average evolves parallel to it. The magnitude of the lag determines the vulnerability to extinction. In finite populations, stochastic variation in the genetic variance can be quite pronounced, and bottlenecks in the genetic variance temporarily can impair the population's adaptive capacity enough to cause extinction when it would otherwise be unlikely in an effectively infinite population.

How likely is a population to win the race between population decline and adaptive evolution? Assuming that environmental degradation progresses across a habitat, we analyze the impact of several ecological factors on the probability of evolutionary rescue. Specifically, we study the influence of population structure and density-dependent competition as well as the speed and severity of environmental change. We also determine the relative contribution of standing genetic variation and new mutations to evolutionary rescue. To describe population structure, we use a generalized island model, where islands are affected by environmental deterioration one after the other. Our analysis is based on the mathematical theory of time-inhomogeneous branching processes and complemented by computer simulations. We find that in the interplay of various, partially antagonistic effects, the probability of evolutionary rescue can show nontrivial and unexpected dependence on ecological characteristics. In particular, we generally observe a nonmonotonic dependence on the migration rate between islands. Counterintuitively, under some circumstances, evolutionary rescue can occur more readily in the face of harsher environmental shifts, because of the reduced competition experienced by mutant individuals. Similarly, rescue sometimes occurs more readily when the entire habitat degrades rapidly, rather than progressively over time, particularly when migration is high and competition strong.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:39:56","2022-10-11T14:39:56Z",NA,"E17–E35","","1",183,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find the herbivore usually reduces adaptation speed and persistence time of the plant by reducing biomass. However, if the plant interaction trait and thermal trait are correlated, herbivores can create different coevolutionary attractors. One attractor has a warmer plant thermal optimum, and the other a colder one compared with the environment. A warmer plant thermal strategy is given a head start under warming, the only case where herbivores can increase plant persistence under warming.

In the context of regional ecosystem service and landscape management where global IPCC climate simulations and their downscaled derivates are applied, it can be useful to work with regional socio-economic scenarios that are coherent with the global IPCC scenarios. The consistency with the original source scenarios, transparency and reproducibility of the methods used as well as the internal consistency of the derived scenarios are important methodological prerequisites for coherently downscaling pre-existing source scenarios. In contrast to well-established systematic-qualitative scenario techniques, we employ here a formal technique of scenario construction which combines expert judgement with a quantitative, indicator-based selection algorithm in order to deduce a formally consistent set of focus scenario. In our case study, these focus scenarios reflect the potential development pathways of major national-level drivers for ecosystem service management in Swiss mountain regions. The integration of an extra impact factor (""Global Trends"") directly referring to the four principle SRES scenario families, helped us to formally internalise base assumptions of IPCC SRES scenarios to regional scenarios that address a different thematic focus (ecosystem service management), spatial level (national) and time horizon (2050). Compared to the well-established systematic-qualitative approach, we find strong similarities between the two methods, including the susceptibility to personal judgement which is only partly reduced by the formal method. However, the formalised scenario approach conveys four clear advantages, (1) the better documentation of the process, (2) its reproducibility, (3) the openness in terms of the number and directions of the finally selected set of scenarios, and (4) its analytical power. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:55","2022-10-11T14:39:55Z",NA,"21–32","","",86,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Downscaling socio-economic scenarios; Formalised scenario analysis; IPCC; Nested scenarios; Regional ecosystem service management","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here it is shown that interspecific competition may slow down rates of adaptation substantially and fundamentally change patterns of adaptation to long-term environmental changes. In the model investigated here, species compete for resources distributed along an ecological niche space. Environmental change is represented by a slowly moving resource maximum and evolutionary responses of single species are compared with responses of coalitions of two and three competing species. In scenarios with two and three species, species that are favored by increasing resource availability increase in equilibrium population size whereas disfavored species decline in size. Increased competition makes it less favorable for individuals of a disfavored species to occupy a niche close to the maximum and reduces the selection pressure for tracking the moving resource distribution. Individual-based simulations and an analysis using adaptive dynamics show that the combination of weaker selection pressure and reduced population size reduces the evolutionary rate of the disfavored species considerably. If the resource landscape moves stochastically, weak evolutionary responses cause large fluctuations in population size and thereby large extinction risk for competing species, whereas a single species subject to the same environmental variability may track the resource maximum closely and maintain a much more stable population size. Other studies have shown that competitive interactions may amplify changes in mean population sizes due to environmental changes and thereby increase extinction risks. This study accentuates the harmful role of competitive interactions by illustrating that they may also decrease rates of adaptation. The slowdown in evolutionary rates caused by competition may also contribute to explain low rates of morphological change in spite of large environmental fluctuations found in fossil records.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:39:55","2022-10-11T14:39:55Z",NA,"421–435","","2",62,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Competition; Ecological communities; Environmental change; Evolutionary response","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and habitat degradation are the greatest threats to mammals in Europe and the rest of the world. Despite the fact that extensive literature exists, no comprehensive review or synthesis is available to date and this may slow down scientific progress and hamper conservation efforts. 2. The goal of this study is to understand if and in what direction progress has been made in the study of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on the spatial distribution of European terrestrial mammals. Firstly,we carry out a general synthesis which is structured around 11 key points. The aim of this point-by-point analysis is to identify trends, knowledge gaps and any significant bias in the available literature, and to highlight strengths and shortfalls of the different approaches which have to date been applied. Secondly, we follow a species-specific systematic approach: for each species, we synthesise key results. 3. Our results show how substantial progress has been hampered for several reasons including: a large predominance of small-scale field studies of short duration, and a generalised lack of control of: (i) confounding variables; (ii) spatial autocorrelation; and (iii) false absences. Also, despite the relatively high number of studies, few were theoretical studies and even fewer were meta-analyses. The lack of meta-analyses is likely to be due to the small amount of crucial details included in the publications, such as model parameters or information on the landscape context (such as the amount of residual forest cover). 4. We synthesise the main results for 14 species. The level of progress is highly variable: for some species, such as the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, a series of long-term, large-scale process-oriented studies has allowed an in-depth understand- ing of its ecology in fragmented landscapes. On the other hand, with other species such as the bank vole Myodes glareolus, despite a relatively large number of field studies, little progress has been made.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:39:54","2022-10-11T14:39:54Z",NA,"125–154","","2",40,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Carnivores; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat loss; Landscape; Patch; Rodents","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Swedish environmental policy is based on 16 environmental quality objectives (EQOs) that national authorities are obliged to observe. These objectives are reviewed annually and evaluated in depth every four years. Here we describe and explore a futures study project for introducing more long-term thinking into work on the EQOs, which we tested in the in-depth evaluation in 2008. We found it difficult to design a collective scenario for a case with a wide variety of objectives and individuals with different backgrounds. However, this difficulty makes it even more important to incorporate futures studies into the work of the relevant authorities. Scenario work is often subcontracted, leading to a constant lack of futures studies expertise and thinking within authorities. Despite the difficulties, we found that experts within the authorities did begin to recognise the opportunities provided by futures studies. The project revealed an interest and need for futures studies within the authorities in charge of Swedish environmental quality objectives and our findings show that the authorities need to build up their own skills in futures studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:39:54","2022-10-11T14:39:54Z",NA,"498–512","","4",43,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It allows the representation of age- and size-structured populations comprised of groups of individuals that interact within a spatialized food web. Within each group, which constitutes the basic interaction entity (the 'super-individual' in individual-based modelling terminology), fish belong to the same species, have similar biological parameters and behaviour rules. Somatic growth, reproduction, predation and starvation processes are modelled. Two rules apply for the predation process: for a given fish group, prey selection depends both on the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the predator and its prey, and on the respective lengths of the prey versus the predator. Thus, fish feed regardless of the taxonomy of their prey. The strength of both predation and competition relationships therefore vary according to changes in relative species abundance. Preliminary investigations are conducted on a theoretical community comprising seven interacting species. The simulation results show how community stability can emerge from variability in species biomass. It is thus suggested that size-based trophic interactions, along with the existence of multiple weak links and species redundancy, favour community persistence and stability. © 2001 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",2001,"2022-10-11 14:39:54","2022-10-11T14:39:54Z",NA,"65–80","","2",14,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem stability; Individual-based model; Multispecific model; Size-based predation; Trophic interactions","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In principle, globalisation can maximise productivity and efficiency if competition prompts specialisation on the basis of productive capacity. In reality, however, such specialisation is often constrained by practical or political barriers, including those intended to ensure national or regional food security. These are likely to produce globally sub-optimal distributions of land uses. Both outcomes are subject to the responses of individual land managers to economic and environmental stimuli, and these responses are known to be variable and often (economically) irrational. We investigate the consequences of stylised food security policies and globalisation of agricultural markets on land use patterns under a variety of modelled forms of land manager behaviour, including variation in production levels, tenacity, land use intensity and multi-functionality. We find that a system entirely dedicated to regional food security is inferior to an entirely globalised system in terms of overall production levels, but that several forms of behaviour limit the difference between the two, and that variations in land use intensity and functionality can substantially increase the provision of food and other ecosystem services in both cases.

We developed a model with local participants to explore the trade-offs between conservation and development in southeastern Cameroon, where illegal hunting is regarded as the greatest challenge to conservation. We simulated the effects of different ICDP strategies by varying the degree of focus on antipoaching activities, anticorruption measures and direct development investments, and by varying the overall budget for such activities. Our outcome variables were numbers of selected wildlife species and household incomes. The model outcomes from the different scenarios were used to stimulate debate among stakeholders. Contributing to poverty alleviation while maintaining current animal population sizes will be extremely difficult and will require long-term external financial support. Devoting greater attention to improving local environmental governance emerged as the highest priority for this investment. We used the model outputs to inform some of the major policy makers in the region.

We present a method to address uncertainty in: i) future climate and socio-economic scenarios and ii) the interlinked network of meta-models that make up the IAP. A mixed-method approach is taken: formal numerical approaches, modeller interviews and network analysis are combined to provide a holistic uncertainty assessment that considers both quantifiable and un-quantifiable uncertainty. Results demonstrate that the combined quantitative-qualitative approach provides considerable advantages over traditional, validation-based uncertainty assessments. Combined fuzzy-set methods and network analysis methods allow maps of modeller certainty to be explored. The results indicate that validation statistics are not the only factors driving modeller certainty; a large range of other factors including the quality and availability of validation data, the meta-modelling process, inter-modeller trust, derivation methods, and pragmatic factors such as time, resources, skills and experience influence modeller certainty.

We report a field experiment designed to explore the responses by hedgehogs to novel and unfavourable terrain, which they encounter when dispersing between fragmented local populations in farmland. We identified four replicate sites as unused by hedgehogs, but lying between existing populations and containing locally abundant food. At each site, we released six hedgehogs from distant sources at 2-day intervals and monitored their subsequent dispersals over 20 days by radio-tracking. We compared movement trajectories under this treatment to those of 29 hedgehogs released at two sites known to support abundant hedgehogs. A third treatment comprised 20 unmanipulated hedgehogs at three sites. We estimated habitat use and proximity to habitats by comparing each observed trajectory to simulated random walks of equal length. We sought differences between treatments in movement and habitat use from nested analysis of variance. 2. No two trajectories of any translocated hedgehogs followed the same route; most involved little change in body weight, and took the animal into or through existing populations. Hedgehogs moved substantially further and faster on average from the unfavourable than from the favourable sites. They showed a significantly stronger attraction to habitat edges, which therefore acted as corridors, and a significant proportion of them stayed closer to roads and to urban habitat than random expectation. Habitat preferences also shifted significantly towards urban and away from arable areas. Six were predated, and two killed by road traffic. At least three returned to their release point, with P \textless 0·05 of this occurring by chance. 3. In this region, natural dispersals between populations up to 4 km apart are rare events.

AES based on the habitat requirements of target species have usually been successful, but the concurrence of species groups with contrasting habitat requirements (guilds) makes the design of successful measures for the whole bird community difficult. The effectiveness of AES is also constrained by landscape and regional effects not addressed by its field-scale application. Effects acting at different spatial scales could differ among bird species depending on basic life-history traits such home range size and landscape perception, which should covary with body size. We are not aware, however, of any study which investigates whether relative effects at different spatial scales could vary predictably within bird guilds. We analyse whether relative effects of within-field (including AES application), landscape and regional factors on open-land birds differ according to body size. Large birds were mostly affected by regional and landscape factors, whereas for small birds landscape and within-field factors were important. Hence, relative effects at changing spatial scales showed predictable variation according to bird size within this endangered and specialised farmland guild.

While Species Distribution Models (SDM) are the main tool used for these purposes, choosing the best SDM algorithm is not straightforward as these are plentiful and can be applied in many different ways. SDM are used mainly to gain insight in 1) overall species distributions, 2) their past-present-future probability of occurrence and/or 3) to understand their ecological niche limits (also referred to as ecological niche modelling). The fact that these three aims may require different models and outputs is, however, rarely considered and has not been evaluated consistently. Here we use data from a systematically sampled set of species occurrences to specifically test the performance of Species Distribution Models across several commonly used algorithms. Species range in distribution patterns from rare to common and from local to widespread. We compare overall model fit (representing species distribution), the accuracy of the predictions at multiple spatial scales, and the consistency in selection of environmental correlations all across multiple modelling runs. As expected, the choice of modelling algorithm determines model outcome. However, model quality depends not only on the algorithm, but also on the measure of model fit used and the scale at which it is used.

Fishing, in addition to simply removing biomass, also truncates the age and size structure of fish populations and often results in localized depletions. We summarize recent research suggesting that an old-growth age structure, combined with a broad spatial distribution of spawning and recruitment, is at least as important as spawning biomass in maintaining long-term sustainable population levels. In particular, there is evidence that older, larger female rockfishes produce larvae that with- stand starvation longer and grow faster than the offspring of younger fish, that stocks may actually consist of several reproductively isolated units, and that recruitment may come from only a small and different fraction of the spawning population each year. None of these phenomena is accounted for in current management programs. We examine alter- native management measures that address these specific issues and conclude that the best and perhaps only way to ensure old-growth age structure and complex spatial structure in populations of groundfish is through interconnected networks of marine reserves",2007,"2022-10-11 14:39:52","2022-10-11T14:39:52Z",NA,"23–32","","8",29,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Collecting distribution data at a finer resolution for large numbers of species requires a comprehensive sampling effort, making it impractical and expensive. This study outlines the incorporation of existing knowledge into a conventional approach to predict the distribution of Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) at a resolution 100 times finer than available atlas data. Location Malaga province, Andalusia, southern Spain. Methods A Bayesian expert system was proposed to utilize the knowledge from distribution models to yield the probability of a species being recorded at a finer resolution (1 × 1 km) than the original atlas data (10 × 10 km). The recorded probability was then used as a weight vector to generate a sampling scheme from the species atlas to enhance the accuracy of the modelling procedure. The maximum entropy for species distribution modelling (MaxEnt) was used as the species distribution model. A comparison was made between the results of the MaxEnt using the enhanced and, the random sampling scheme, based on four groups of environmental variables: topographic, climatic, biological and anthropogenic. Results The models with the sampling scheme enhanced by an expert system had a higher discriminative capacity than the baseline models. The downscaled (i.e. finer scale) species distribution maps using a hybrid MaxEnt/expert system approach were more specific to the nest locations and were more contrasted than those of the baseline model. Main conclusions The proposed method is a feasible substitute for comprehensive field work. The approach developed in this study is applicable for predicting the distribution of Bonelli's eagle at a local scale from a national-level occurrence data set; however, the usefulness of this approach may be limited to well-known species.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:39:52","2022-10-11T14:39:52Z",NA,"1173–1185","","6",17,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aquila fasciata; Bayesian expert system; Bonelli's eagle; Downscaling; Malaga; Maximum entropy; Sampling; Spain","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecosystem models used to evaluate such trade-offs need to have the capability of capturing the dynamic stability that can arise when predator-prey interactions are restricted to spatial and temporal arenas. Foraging arenas appear common in aquatic systems and are created by a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from restrictions of predator distributions in response to predation risk caused by their own predators, to risk-sensitive foraging behaviour by their prey. Foraging arenas partition the prey in each predator-prey interaction in a food web into vulnerable and invulnerable states, with exchange between these states potentially limiting overall trophic flow. Inclusion of vulnerability exchange processes in models for recruitment processes and food web responses to disturbances like harvesting leads to very different predictions about dynamic stability, trophic cascades and maintenance of ecological diversity than do models based on large-scale mass action (random mixing) interactions between prey and predators. Although a number of methods to estimate these critical exchange rates are presented, none are considered fully satisfactory. The most important challenge for the practical application of models that incorporate foraging arena theory today is not only developing new or improved methods for measuring exchange rates but also evaluating how such rates vary in responses to major fishery-induced changes in abundances of predators.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:51","2022-10-11T14:39:51Z",NA,"41–59","","1",13,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Compensatory responses; Ecosim; Food web dynamics; Predator-prey interactions; Ratio dependence","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, up to now, agricultural sector models and models on land use change have used technological change as an exogenous input due to various information and data deficiencies. This paper provides a first attempt towards an endogenous implementation based on a measure of agricultural land use intensity. We relate this measure to empirical data on investments in technological change. Our estimated yield elasticity with respect to research investments is 0.29 and production costs per area increase linearly with an increasing yield level. Implemented in the global land use model MAgPIE (""Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment"") this approach provides estimates of future yield growth.Highest future yield increases are required in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. Our validation with FAO data for the period 1995-2005 indicates that the model behavior is in line with observations.

These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change.

Ecosystems have been understood in various ways, from non-interacting populations of species to complex integrated systems. Health has been seen as a metaphor, an indicator that aggregates over system components, or a non-localized emergent system property. After a review, we define good ecosystem health as: 'the condition of a system that is self-maintaining, vigorous, resilient to externally imposed pressures, and able to sustain services to humans. It contains healthy organisms and populations, and adequate functional diversity and functional response diversity. All expected trophic levels are present and well interconnected, and there is good spatial connectivity amongst subsystems.' We equate this condition with good ecological or environmental status, e.g. as referred to by recent EU Directives. Resilience is central to health, but difficult to measure directly. Ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure are at risk of losing resilience, and thus of suffering regime shifts and loss of services. For monitoring whole ecosystems, we propose an approach based on 'trajectories in ecosystem state space', illustrated with time-series from the northwestern North Sea. Change is visualized as Euclidian distance from an arbitrary reference state. Variability about a trend in distance is used as a proxy for inverse resilience. We identify the need for institutional support for long time-series to underpin this approach, and for research to establish state space co-ordinates for systems in good health.

It is important to understand if and how regimes are effective in tackling these problems, which requires knowledge on their potential impact on these problems as well as on their political feasibility. Integrated assessments of global environmental change, which are mainly bio-physical and technology-economic oriented, barely address knowledge on environmental regimes, due to problems in drawing general and policy relevant lessons on regime effectiveness and inherent difficulties in modelling human and social dimensions. This paper presents an innovative approach to formalize knowledge on the effectiveness of environmental regimes, so that scientists from both the political science and integrated assessment domain can understand it, discuss it and contribute to it. We constructed a conceptual framework for the systematic analysis of conditions that influence regime effectiveness and implemented it in a computer model using fuzzy logic methodology. We evaluated the fuzzy model in an ex post case study on four existing international environmental regimes. The model can be used as an aid in analysing the effectiveness of existing or future regimes, highlighting which determinants contribute to success or failure, and it enables systematic and meaningful comparisons between regimes and policy measures.We discovered that formalizing knowledge on environmental regimes in a framework and model enhanced its transparency and deductive power as it forced us to be explicit about our choices and assumptions. Developing and using the framework and model also revealed the lacunae in knowledge in environmental regime theory which may inform regime researchers to further structure and increase their knowledge. By making knowledge on environmental regimes explicit and understandable we have taken an important step towards a better integration of political science in integrated assessments. We believe, however, that this integration is still in its early days and requires further attention in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:39:50","2022-10-11T14:39:50Z",NA,"101–112","","",44,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Fuzzy logic; Governance; Integrated assessment; Interdisciplinary; Knowledge formalization; Regimes","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we propose a new framework, coupling species distribution and trophic models, to predict climate change impacts on food-web structure across the Mediterranean Sea. Sea surface temperature was used to determine the fish climate niches and their future distributions. Body size was used to infer trophic interactions between fish species. Our projections reveal that 54 fish species of 256 endemic and native species included in our analysis would disappear by 2080-2099 from the Mediterranean continental shelf. The number of feeding links between fish species would decrease on 73.4% of the continental shelf. However, the connectance of the overall fish web would increase on average, from 0.26 to 0.29, mainly due to a differential loss rate of feeding links and species richness. This result masks a systematic decrease in predator generality, estimated here as the number of prey species, from 30.0 to 25.4. Therefore, our study highlights large-scale impacts of climate change on marine food-web structure with potential deep consequences on ecosystem functioning.

First, we discuss the terminology of mean-field approximation which is used in the ecological modelling literature and show that the various existing interpretations of the mean-field concept can imply different meanings. Then we classify and compare various methods of reducing spatially explicit models to mean-field models: spatial moment approximation, aggregation techniques and the mean-field limit of IBMs. We emphasize the importance of spatial scales in the reduction of spatially explicit models and briefly consider the inverse problem of scaling up local ecological interactions from microscales to macroscales. Then we discuss the current challenges and limitations for construction of mean-field population models. We emphasize the need for developing mixed methods based on a combination of various reduction techniques to cope with the spatio-temporal complexity of real ecosystems including processes taking place on multiple time and space scales. Finally, we argue that the construction of analytically tractable mean-field models is becoming a key issue to provide an insight into the major mechanisms of ecosystem functioning.

We assessed how future land use change (LUC) can influence future carbon stock change in soil and vegetation in the EU. The emphasis is on the role of LUC in the overall carbon balance of the EU biosphere. Because LUC is the most dynamic driving factor of terrestrial carbon stock change, it is important to account for the dynamics of LUC in carbon stock change modelling. The major challenge in coupling a carbon model and a LUC model is the difference in spatial and temporal resolution generally used in these modelling approaches. We used a high-resolution LUC model and a carbon bookkeeping approach that takes into account effects of soil and forest age on carbon stock changes. These approaches best fit the chosen resolution and extent in a consistent manner. Four SRES scenarios that cover a range of possible future developments were evaluated: Global Economy (A1): lean government, strong globalization; Continental Markets (A2): lean government, regional cultural and economic development; Global Co-operation (B1): much governmental intervention, strong globalization; Regional Communities (B2): much governmental intervention, regional cultural and economic development. If land use remains unchanged, carbon sequestration rates are expected to decrease by 4% in 2030 relative to 2000. LUC causes an additional sequestration rate decrease in the A2 scenario of 2% in 2030. In the other three scenarios, sequestration rate increases by 9-16% in 2030 relative to 2000. In 2030, the terrestrial biosphere in the EU is expected to sequester between 90 and 111 Tg C year-1. This is 6.5-8% of the projected anthropogenic emissions. In the B2 scenario, the highest sequestration rate increase is expected (15 Tg C year-1). Clear differences are found in the spatial distribution of sinks and sources between the scenarios, illustrating that land use is an important factor in future carbon sequestration changes that cannot be ignored. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We analysed eight datasets, including five animal groups, to examine how well a trait-based approach, compared with a more traditional taxonomic approach, predicts seven ecosystem functions below- and above-ground. Trait-based indices consistently provided greater explanatory power than species richness or abundance. The frequency distributions of single or multiple traits in the community were the best predictors of ecosystem functioning. This implies that the ecosystem functions we investigated were underpinned by the combination of trait identities (i.e. single-trait indices) and trait complementarity (i.e. multi-trait indices) in the communities.

Whereas the potential provision of economic benefits from ecosystems to people is often quantified through ecological production functions, the use of and demand for ecosystem services has received less attention, as have the spatial flows of services from ecosystems to people. However, new modeling approaches that map and quantify service-specific sources (ecosystem capacity to provide a service), sinks (biophysical or anthropogenic features that deplete or alter service flows), users (user locations and level of demand), and spatial flows can provide a more complete understanding of ecosystem services. Through a case study in Puget Sound, Washington State, USA, we quantify and differentiate between the theoretical or in situ provision of services, i.e., ecosystems' capacity to supply services, and their actual provision when accounting for the location of beneficiaries and the spatial connections that mediate service flows between people and ecosystems. Our analysis includes five ecosystem services: carbon sequestration and storage, riverine flood regulation, sediment regulation for reservoirs, open space proximity, and scenic viewsheds. Each ecosystem service is characterized by different beneficiary groups and means of service flow. Using the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) methodology we map service supply, demand, and flow, extending on simpler approaches used by past studies to map service provision and use. With the exception of the carbon sequestration service, regions that actually provided services to people, i.e., connected to beneficiaries via flow paths, amounted to 16-66% of those theoretically capable of supplying services, i.e., all ecosystems across the landscape. These results offer a more complete understanding of the spatial dynamics of ecosystem services and their effects, and may provide a sounder basis for economic valuation and policy applications than studies that consider only theoretical service provision and/or use. © 2014 by the author(s).",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:48","2022-10-11T14:39:48Z",NA,"","","2",19,NA,NA,"From theoretical to actual ecosystem services: map",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Beneficiaries; Benefits; Demand side; Mapping; Provisioning areas; Spatial dynamics; Spatial flow","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Estimates of future declines, which might indicate different priorities than past declines, have been limited by the lack of appropriate data and models. Given that much of conservation is about anticipating and responding to future threats, our inability to look forward at a global scale has been a major constraint on effective action. Here, we assess the geography and extent of projected future changes in suitable habitat for terrestrial mammals within their present ranges. We used a global earth-system model, IMAGE, coupled with fine-scale habitat suitability models and parametrized according to four global scenarios of human development. We identified the most affected countries by 2050 for each scenario, assuming that no additional conservation actions other than those described in the scenarios take place. We found that, with some exceptions, most of the countries with the largest predicted losses of suitable habitat for mammals are in Africa and the Americas. African and North American countries were also predicted to host the most species with large proportional global declines. Most of the countries we identified as future hotspots of terrestrial mammal loss have little or no overlap with the present global conservation priorities, thus confirming the need for forward-looking analyses in conservation priority setting. The expected growth in human populations and consumption in hotspots of future mammal loss mean that local conservation actions such as protected areas might not be sufficient to mitigate losses.

Although it is written as a text for a course at the graduate or upper division undergraduate level, the book is also suitable for self-study and for industry-oriented courses of continuing education. No previous knowledge of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic is required for understanding the material covered in the book. Although knowledge of basic ideas of classical (nonfuzzy) set theory and classical (two-valued) logic is useful, fundamentals of these subject areas are briefly overviewed in the book. In addition, basic ideas of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and rough sets are also explained. This makes the book virtually self-contained. Throughout the book, many examples are used to illustrate concepts, methods, and generic applications as they are introduced. Each chapter is followed by a set of exercises, which are intended to enhance readers' understanding of the material presented in the chapter. Extensive and carefully selected bibliography, together with bibliographical notes at the end of each chapter and a bibliographical subject index, is an invaluable resource for further study of fuzzy theory and applications.",2003,"2022-10-11 14:39:47","2022-10-11T14:39:47Z",NA,"","44","",20,NA,NA,"",NA,"1",NA,NA,"Prentice Hall","Upper Saddle River, New Jersey","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1016/s0160-9327(96)90083-6",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite these properties, the field of future studies is slow to adopt FCM and to apply the increasingly solid theoretical foundations and rigorous practices for FCM applications that are evolving in other fields. This paper therefore discusses theoretical and practical aspects of constructing and applying FCMs within the context of future studies: based on an extensive literature review and the authors' experience with FCM projects, it provides an introduction of fundamental concepts of FCM modelling, a step-wise description and discussion of practical methods and their pitfalls, and an overview over future research directions for FCM in future studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:47","2022-10-11T14:39:47Z",NA,"45–57","","",61,NA,NA,"Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for futures studies—A methodo",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Future studies; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; Mental model; Scenarios; System thinking","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Different interpolation models in GIS environment are used to generate fine scale (250∈×∈250 m 2 ) precipitation surfaces from PRECIS precipitation data. Results show that the multivariate extension model of ordinary kriging that uses elevation as secondary data is the best model especially for monsoon months. Model results are further compared with observations from 25 meteorological stations in the study area. Modeled data show overall good correlation with observations confirming the ability of PRECIS to capture major precipitation features in the region. Results for low and erratic precipitation months, September and October, are however showing poor correlation with observations. During monsoon months (June, July, August) precipitation pattern is different from the rest of the months. It increases from south to north, but during monsoon maximum precipitation is in the southern regions of the Himalayas, and extreme northern areas receive very less precipitation. Modeled precipitation toward the end of the twenty-first century under A2 and B2 scenarios show overall decrease during winter and increase in spring and monsoon in the study area. Spatially, both scenarios show similar pattern but with varying magnitude. In monsoon, the Himalayan southern regions will have more precipitation, whereas northern areas and southern plains will face decrease in precipitation. Western and south western areas will suffer from less precipitation throughout the year except peak monsoon months. T test results also show that changes in monthly precipitation over the study area are significant except for July, August, and December.

"MWSE74CZ","report",2006,"Diversity, Convention on Biological; Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity","Global Biodiversity Outlook 2.","","","","","www.biodiv.org","Biological diversity, or biodiversity, is the term given to the variety of life on Earth. It is the combination of life forms and their interactions with one another, and with the physical environment that has made Earth habitable for humans. Ecosystems provide the basic necessities of life, offer protection from natural disasters and disease, and are the foundation for human culture. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment—a scientific undertaking involving over 1300 experts working in 95 countries—recently confirmed the overwhelming contributions made by natural ecosystems to human life and well-being. Yet even as we begin to better understand what is at stake, genes, species and habitats are rapidly being lost. Concern over the loss of biodiversity and the recognition of its important role in supporting human life motivated the creation, in 1992, of the Convention on Biological Diversity, a legally binding global treaty. The Convention encompasses three equally important and complementary objectives: the conservation of biodiversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. Participation in the Convention is nearly universal, a sign that our global society is well aware of the need to work together to ensure the survival of life on Earth. In 2002, the Conference of the Parties of the Convention adopted a Strategic Plan, with the mission “to achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national level, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on Earth”. Th is 2010 target was subsequently endorsed by the Heads of State and Government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa. Recently, world leaders meeting at the 2005 World Summit of the United Nations reiterated their commitment to meeting the 2010 target. In order to assess progress towards the 2010 Biodiversity Target, the Conference of the Parties has established supporting goals and targets and identified indicators for evaluating biodiversity status and trends. The second edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook makes use of these indicators and targets to describe current trends in biodiversity and prospects for achieving the 2010 target. Why biodiversity loss is a concern The services provided by healthy, biodiverse ecosystems are the foundation for human well-being. However, out of the 24 ecosystem services recently assessed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 15 are in decline. These include the provision of fresh water, marine fishery production, the number and quality of places of spiritual and religious value, the ability of the atmosphere to cleanse itself of pollutants, natural hazard regulation, pollination, and the capacity of agricultural ecosystems to provide pest control. Biodiversity loss disrupts ecosystem functions, making ecosystems more vulnerable to shocks and disturbances, less resilient, and less able to supply humans with needed services. The damage to coastal communities from floods and storms, for example, can increase dramatically where protective wetland habitats have been lost or degraded. The consequences of biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption are often harshest for the rural poor, who depend most immediately upon local ecosystem services for their livelihoods and who are often the least able to access or afford substitutes when these become degraded. In fact, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment has confirmed that biodiversity loss poses a significant barrier to meeting the needs of the world's poorest, as set out in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Garnering the political will to halt ecosystem degradation will depend on clearly demonstrating to policy makers and society at large the full contribution made by ecosystems to poverty alleviation efforts and to national economic growth more generally. Apart from nature's immediate usefulness to humankind, many would argue that every life form has an intrinsic right to exist, and deserves protection. We must also recognize the right of future generations to inherit, as we have, a planet thriving with life, and that continues to afford opportunities to reap the economic, cultural and spiritual benefits of nature. The 2010 target: establishing current trends In using the Convention's indicators to survey current trends, Global Biodiversity Outlook 2 demonstrates that biodiversity is being lost at all levels, for example:  Deforestation, mainly through conversion of forests to agricultural land, continues at an alarmingly high rate. Th e loss of primary forest since 2000 has been estimated at 6 million hectares annually. Coastal and marine ecosystems have been heavily impacted by human activities, with degradation leading to a reduced coverage of kelp forests, seagrasses and corals. In the Caribbean, average hard coral cover declined from about 50% to 10% in the last three decades. Some 35% of mangroves have been lost in the last two decades in countries for which adequate data are available.  Trends of some 3,000 wild populations of species show a consistent decline in average species abundance of about 40% between 1970 and 2000; inland water species declined by 50%, while marine and terrestrial species both declined by around 30%. Studies of amphibians globally, African mammals, birds in agricultural lands, British butterflies, Caribbean and Indo-Pacific corals, and commonly harvested fish species show declines in the majority of species assessed.  More species are becoming threatened with extinction. The status of bird species show a continuing deterioration across all biomes over the last two decades and preliminary findings for other major groups, such as amphibians and mammals, indicate that the situation is likely worse than for birds. Between 12% and 52% of species within well-studied higher taxa are threatened with extinction. In addition, forests and other natural habitats are increasingly fragmented, affecting their ability to maintain biodiversity and deliver ecosystem goods and services. Within the 292 large river systems assessed, for instance, only 12% of river-basin area was unaffected by dam-based impacts. The intensification of fishing has led to the decline in large high-value fishes, such as tuna, cod, sea bass and swordfish, which are high up in the food chain. In the North Atlantic, the number of large fish has declined by two-thirds in the last 50 years. The threats to biodiversity are generally increasing. Humans contribute more reactive nitrogen to ecosystems globally than do all natural processes combined. The rate and risk of alien species introductions have increased signifi cantly in the recent past, and will continue to rise as a result of increased travel, trade and tourism. Overall, unsustainable consumption continues, as indicated by our growing global ecological footprint. Th e global demand for resources now exceeds the biological capacity of the Earth to renew these resources by some 20%. On the positive side, the number and area of protected areas is increasing, although most ecoregions fall well short of the target to protect 10% of their surface. Marine ecosystems in particular are poorly represented, with approximately 0.6% of the ocean's surface area and about 1.4% of the coastal shelf areas protected. On the basis of information available, a common message emerges: biodiversity is in decline at all levels and geographical scales. However, targeted response options—whether it be the creation of protected areas, or resource management and pollution prevention programmes—can reverse this trend for specific habitats or species. Table 1 gives an overview of the state of indicator development and data. Several indicators have sufficient resolution to determine a change in the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, including: habitat change in certain types of ecosystems; trends in abundance and distribution of selected species; the status of threatened species; the Marine Trophic Index; and nitrogen deposition. Others may be developed for use by 2010. Tools of the Convention for addressing biodiversity loss The Conference of the Parties has responded to the challenge of biodiversity loss by developing a comprehensive body of policy relating to the Convention's three objectives. Policy instruments include: thematic programmes of work of the Convention, covering seven major biomes; cross-cutting programmes of work on technology transfer, taxonomy and protected areas; and principles and guidelines on the ecosystem approach, sustainable use, invasive species, environmental impact assessment and other issues. In addition, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, adopted as a legal instrument in its own right in 2000, aims to ensure that biotechnology does not adversely affect biodiversity or human health. At the national level, provisions of the Convention and the policy decisions of the Conference of the Parties are translated into actions through national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs). As Parties hold primary responsibility for implementation, NBSAPs are central to achieving the objectives of the Convention. Ten years after entry into force of the Convention, and recognizing the need for more effective and coherent implementation, the Conference of the Parties adopted, in 2002, a Strategic Plan. Progress towards the four goals of the Strategic Plan is mixed: Reasonable progress is being made towards Goal 1—to promote international cooperation in support of the Convention. Th e Convention is playing a major role in setting the agenda among biodiversity-related conventions and organizations. However, there remain opportunities to increase policy coherence with other international instruments, particularly under the trade regime; Goal 2 is to ensure that Parties have improved fi",2006,"2022-10-11 14:39:45","2022-10-11T14:39:45Z",NA,"81 + vii pages","","",NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity","Montreal","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1093/aje/kwq338 PMID: 24901598",NA,NA,NA,"916; GLOBIO; biodiversity","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This challenge for developing countries confronts the force of economic globalization, which seeks cropland that is shrinking in availability and triggers deforestation. Four mechanisms-the displacement, rebound, cascade, and remittance effects-that are amplified by economic globalization accelerate land conversion. A few developing countries have managed a land use transition over the recent decades that simultaneously increased their forest cover and agricultural production. These countries have relied on various mixes of agricultural intensification, land use zoning, forest protection, increased reliance on imported food and wood products, the creation of off-farm jobs, foreign capital investments, and remittances. Sound policies and innovations can therefore reconcile forest preservation with food production. Globalization can be harnessed to increase land use efficiency rather than leading to uncontrolled land use expansion. To do so, land systems should be understood and modeled as open systems with large flows of goods, people, and capital that connect local land use with global-scale factors.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:39:43","2022-10-11T14:39:43Z",NA,"3465–3472","","9",108,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We focused on the following environmental variables: land cover, elevation and hydrological features. Models were developed at 300 m resolution and limited to within species' known geographical ranges. A subset of the models was validated using points of known species occurrence. We conducted a global, fine-scale analysis of patterns of species richness. The richness of mammal species estimated by the overlap of their suitable habitat is on average one-third less than that estimated by the overlap of their geographical ranges. The highest absolute difference is found in tropical and subtropical regions in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia that are not covered by dense forest. The proportion of suitable habitat within mammal geographical ranges correlates with the IUCN Red List category to which they have been assigned, decreasing monotonically from Least Concern to Endangered.

While a variety of studies quantify and analyze climate change impacts at the level of crop yields, it has been recognized that changes in yield variability may have even more important effects on food security. In addition, large-scale analysis is typically based on different scenarios rather than providing aid to determine decisions that are robust across these scenarios. We develop a stochastic version of a global recursive dynamic partial equilibrium model integrating the agricultural, bio-energy and forestry sectors in order to examine food security under crop yield variability. The results indicate that food security requires overproduction to meet minimum food supply constraints. This does not only lead to higher prices, but also to larger cropped areas associated with an increase in GHG emissions and pressure on biodiversity, as more natural areas are converted to agriculture.

Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100-110% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO(2)-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y(-1) and N use ∼250 Mt y(-1) by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y(-1), and global N use of ∼225 Mt y(-1).

These data show that livestock production is growing rapidly, which is interpreted to be the result of the increasing demand for animal products. Although there is a great rise in global livestock production, the pattern of consumption is very uneven. The countries that consume the least amount of meat are in Africa and South Asia. The main determinant of per capita meat consumption appears to be wealth. Overall, there has been a rise in the production of livestock products and this is expected to continue in the future. This is particularly the case in developing countries. The greatest increase is in the production of poultry and pigs, as well as eggs and milk.

We use recently developed high-resolution habitat suitability models to conduct comparative analyses and to identify global hotspots of fragmentation and connectivity for the world's terrestrial carnivores. Species with less fragmentation (i.e. more interior high-quality habitat) had larger geographical ranges, a greater proportion of habitat within their range, greater habitat connectivity and a lower risk of extinction. Species with higher connectivity (i.e. less habitat isolation) also had a greater proportion of high-quality habitat, but had smaller, not larger, ranges, probably reflecting shorter distances between habitat patches for species with restricted distributions; such species were also more threatened, as would be expected given the negative relationship between range size and extinction risk.

In this paper we provide a detailed analysis of the iLUC effect, and further address the issues of deforestation, irrigation water use, and crop price increases due to expanding biofuel acreage. We use GLOBIOM - an economic partial equilibrium model of the global forest, agriculture, and biomass sectors with a bottom-up representation of agricultural and forestry management practices. The results indicate that second generation biofuel production fed by wood from sustainably managed existing forests would lead to a negative iLUC factor, meaning that overall emissions are 27% lower compared to the ""No biofuel"" scenario by 2030. The iLUC factor of first generation biofuels global expansion is generally positive, requiring some 25 years to be paid back by the GHG savings from the substitution of biofuels for conventional fuels. Second generation biofuels perform better also with respect to the other investigated criteria; on the condition that they are not sourced from dedicated plantations directly competing for agricultural land. If so, then efficient first generation systems are preferable. Since no clear technology champion for all situations exists, we would recommend targeting policy instruments directly at the positive and negative effects of biofuel production rather than at the production itself. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:42","2022-10-11T14:39:42Z",NA,"5690–5702","","10",39,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bioenergy; Biofuels; Electricity; Land use change; Methane; Methanol; Modelling; Synthetic; Transport fuel","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, a global ocean-ice-ecosystem model was assessed against a suite of observation-based planktonic food web flux estimates, many of which were not considered in previous modeling studies. The simulation successfully captured cross-biome differences and similarities in these fluxes after calibration of a limited number of highly uncertain yet influential parameters. The resulting comprehensive carbon budgets suggested that shortened food webs, elevated growth efficiencies, and tight consumer-resource coupling enable oceanic upwelling systems to support 45% of pelagic mesozooplankton production despite accounting for only 22% of ocean area and 34% of NPP. In seasonally stratified regions (42% of ocean area and 40% of NPP), weakened consumer-resource coupling tempers mesozooplankton production to 41% and enhances export below 100. m to 48% of the global total. In oligotrophic systems (36% of ocean area and 26% of NPP), the dominance of small phytoplankton and low consumer growth efficiencies supported only 14% of mesozooplankton production and 17% of export globally. Bacterial production, in contrast, was maintained in nearly constant proportion to primary production across biomes through the compensating effects of increased partitioning of NPP to the microbial food web in oligotrophic ecosystems and increased bacterial growth efficiencies in more productive areas. Cross-biome differences in mesozooplankton trophic level were muted relative to those invoked by previous work such that significant differences in consumer growth efficiencies and the strength of consumer-resource coupling were needed to explain sharp cross-biome differences in mesozooplankton production. Lastly, simultaneous consideration of multiple flux constraints supports a highly distributed view of respiration across the planktonic food web rather than one dominated by heterotrophic bacteria. The solution herein is unlikely unique in its ability to explain observed cross-biome energy flow patterns and notable misfits remain. Resolution of existing uncertainties in observed biome-scale productivity and increasingly mechanistic physical and biological model components should yield significant refinements to estimates herein. © 2013.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:41","2022-10-11T14:39:41Z",NA,"1–28","","",120,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used major vegetation types (biomes) as proxies for natural habitats and, based on projected future biome distributions under doubled-CO2 climates, calculated changes in habitat areas and associated extinctions of endemic plant and vertebrate species in biodiversity hotspots. Because of numerous uncertainties in this approach, we undertook a sensitivity analysis of multiple factors that included (1) two global vegetation models, (2) different numbers of biome classes in our biome classification schemes, (3) different assumptions about whether species distributions were biome specific or not, and (4) different migration capabilities. Extinctions were calculated using both species-area and endemic-area relationships. In addition, average required migration rates were calculated for each hotspot assuming a doubled-CO2 climate in 100 years. Projected percent extinctions ranged from \textless1 to 43% of the endemic biota (average 11.6%), with biome specificity having the greatest influence on the estimates, followed by the global vegetation model and then by migration and biome classification assumptions. Bootstrap comparisons indicated that effects on hotpots as a group were not significantly different from effects on random same-biome collections of grid cells with respect to biome change or migration rates; in some scenarios, however, hotspots exhibited relatively high biome change and low migration rates. Especially vulnerable hotspots were the Cape Floristic Region, Caribbean, Indo-Burma, Mediterranean Basin, Southwest Australia, and Tropical Andes, where plant extinctions per hotspot sometimes exceeded 2000 species. Under the assumption that projected habitat changes were attained in 100 years, estimated global-warming-induced rates of species extinctions in tropical hotspots in some cases exceeded those due to deforestation, supporting suggestions that global warming is one of the most serious threats to the planet's biodiversity.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:39:41","2022-10-11T14:39:41Z",NA,"538–548","","2",20,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biomes; Climate change; General circulation models; Global vegetation models; Migration; Species extinctions","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Current global trends and ecological dynamics are consistent with very different outcomes, defined by alternative assumptions about the technological, economic, demographic, geopolitical, and social aspects of development and the ways in which institutions, personal and public values, and natural systems may be expected to respond to historically novel stressors. Recent advances in scenario analysis have addressed the dual methodological challenge of exploring these uncertainties in an organized way and determining what would be needed to make the transition to sustainability. This paper reviews global scenario research, setting current efforts in a historical context. It focuses on seven recent studies that are comprehensive, regionally disaggregated, and narratively rich-and thus of greatest relevance to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). It summarizes their social visions and the level of quantitative detail used in these exercises. Taken together, this suite of global scenario studies provides a useful platform for the MA by offering insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude of regional pressures on ecosystems, sounding the alert on critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development, and understanding the importance of institutions and values. But these studies are only a point of departure. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions into global development scenarios, as both effects and causes, is at the cutting edge of scenario analysis. The paper concludes by identifying directions for this research program and suggesting ways that the MA can contribute to this effort.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:39:41","2022-10-11T14:39:41Z",NA,"133–142","","2",8,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystems; Global futures; Global modeling; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment; Scenarios; Social visions; Sustainability","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Differences among the scenarios for nutrient management in agriculture were a key factor affecting the magnitude and direction of change of future DIN river export. In contrast, connectivity and level of sewage treatment and P detergent use were more important for differences in DIP river export. Global particulate nutrient export was calculated to decrease for all scenarios, in part due to increases in dams for hydropower. Small changes in dissolved silica and dissolved organics were calculated for all scenarios at the global scale. Population changes were an important underlying factor for river export of all nutrients in all scenarios. Substantial regional differences were calculated for all nutrient elements and forms. South Asia alone accounted for over half of the global increase in DIN and DIP river export between 1970 and 2000 and in the subsequent 30 years under the Global Orchestration scenario (globally connected with reactive approach to environmental problems); DIN river export decreased in the Adapting Mosaic (globally connected with proactive approach) scenario by 2030, although DIP continued to increase.

The models are driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 (Wigley et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a, simulated by the coupled ocean atmosphere model HadCM2-SUL. Simulations with changing CO2 alone show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4–3.8 Pg C y−1 during the 1990s, rising to 3.7–8.6 Pg C y−1 a century later. Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today (0.6–3.0 Pg C y−1) and a century later (0.3–6.6 Pg C y−1) as a result of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the ‘diminishing return' of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure influence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO2 concentration scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used. However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric responses to CO2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of NEP to climate change resulting, primarily, from differences in the way that modelled global NPP responds to a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the magnitude of possible biospheric influences on the carbon balance requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change.",2001,"2022-10-11 14:39:41","2022-10-11T14:39:41Z",NA,"357–373","","4",7,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Dynamic global vegetation model; Global carbon cycle","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Major drivers are land use change, eutrophication, hydrological disturbance, climate change, overexploitation and invasive species. We developed a global model for assessing the dominant human impacts on inland aquatic biodiversity. The system consists of a biodiversity model, named GLOBIO-Aquatic, that is embedded in the IMAGE model framework, i.e. linked to models for demography, economy, land use changes, climate change, nutrient emissions, a global hydrological model and a global map of water bodies. The biodiversity model is based on a recompilation of existing data, thereby scaling-up from local/regional case-studies to global trends. We compared species composition in impacted lakes, rivers and wetlands to that in comparable undisturbed systems. We focussed on broad categories of human-induced pressures that are relevant at the global scale. The drivers currently included are catchment land use changes and nutrient loading affecting water quality, and hydrological disturbance and climate change affecting water quantity. The resulting relative mean abundance of original species is used as indicator for biodiversity intactness. For lakes, we used dominance of harmful algal blooms as an additional indicator. The results show that there is a significant negative relation between biodiversity intactness and these stressors in all types of freshwater ecosystems. In heavily used catchments, standing water bodies would lose about 80% of their biodiversity intactness and running waters about 70%, while severe hydrological disturbance would result in losses of about 80% in running waters and more than 50% in floodplain wetlands. As an illustration, an analysis using the OECD 'baseline scenario' shows a considerable decline of the biodiversity intactness in still existing water bodies in 2000, especially in temperate and subtropical regions, and a further decline especially in tropical regions in 2050. Historical loss of wetland areas is not yet included in these results. The model may inform policy makers at the global level in what regions aquatic biodiversity will be affected most and by what causes, and allows for scenario analysis to evaluate policy options.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:39:40","2022-10-11T14:39:40Z",NA,"99–114","","",48,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Catchment; Cyanobacteria; Eutrophication; Hydrological disturbance; Lakes; Land use change; Rivers; Scenario analysis; Wetlands","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We evaluated the likely effects of these landscape changes on four endpoints: water availability, Willamette River, stream condition, and terrestrial wildlife. All three futures assume a doubling of the 1990 human and water use. We conducted an alternative futures analysis in the Willamette River Basin in western Oregon. Based on detailed input from local stakeholders, three alternative future population by 2050. The Plan Trend 2050 scenario assumes current policies and trends continue. Because Oregon has several conservation-oriented policies in place, landscape implemented exactly as written if no further policy actions were taken. The Development 2050 scenario reflects a loosening of current policies, more market-oriented approach, as proposed by some stakeholders. Estimated effects of this scenario include loss of 24% of changes and projected environmental effects associated with this scenario were surprisingly small (most -\textless10% change relative to 1990). The scenario did, however, engender a debate among stakeholders about the reasonableness of assuming that existing policies would be prime farmland; 39% more wildlife species would lose habitat than gain habitat relative to the 1990 landscape. Projected effects on aquatic biota were less severe, primarily because many of the land use changes involved conversion of agricultural lands into urban or rural development, both of which adversely impact streams. Finally, Conservation 2050 assumes that ecosystem protection and restoration are given higher priority, although still within the bounds of what stakeholders considered plausible. In response, most ecological indi- cators (both terrestrial and aquatic) recovered 20-70% of the losses sustained since EuroAmerican settlement. The one exception is water availability. Water consumed for out- of-stream uses increased under all three future scenarios (by 40-60%), with accompanying decreases in stream flow.

This estimate is derived from a set of 28,000 CO2 mole fraction observations in the global atmosphere that are fed into a state-of-the-art data assimilation system for CO2 called CarbonTracker. By design, the surface fluxes produced in CarbonTracker are consistent with the recent history of CO2 in the atmosphere and provide constraints on the net carbon flux independent from national inventories derived from accounting efforts. We find the North American terrestrial biosphere to have absorbed -0.65 PgC/yr (1 petagram = 1015 g; negative signs are used for carbon sinks) averaged over the period studied, partly offsetting the estimated 1.85 PgC/yr release by fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing. Uncertainty on this estimate is derived from a set of sensitivity experiments and places the sink within a range of -0.4 to -1.0 PgC/yr. The estimated sink is located mainly in the deciduous forests along the East Coast (32%) and the boreal coniferous forests (22%). Terrestrial uptake fell to -0.32 PgC/yr during the large-scale drought of 2002, suggesting sensitivity of the contemporary carbon sinks to climate extremes. CarbonTracker results are in excellent agreement with a wide collection of carbon inventories that form the basis of the first North American State of the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR), to be released in 2007.

In this letter we provide an assessment of proximate drivers of deforestation and forest degradation by synthesizing empirical data reported by countries as part of their REDD+ readiness activities, CIFOR country profiles, UNFCCC national communications and scientific literature. Based on deforestation rate and remaining forest cover 100 (sub)tropical non-Annex I countries were grouped into four forest transition phases. Driver data of 46 countries were summarized for each phase and by continent, and were used as a proxy to estimate drivers for the countries with missing data. The deforestation drivers are similar in Africa and Asia, while degradation drivers are more similar in Latin America and Asia. Commercial agriculture is the most important driver of deforestation, followed by subsistence agriculture. Timber extraction and logging drives most of the degradation, followed by fuelwood collection and charcoal production, uncontrolled fire and livestock grazing.

Although quantitative indicators of social values need to be explicitly accounted for in the decision-making process, they need not be monetary. Ongoing efforts to map such values demonstrate how they can also be made spatially explicit and relatable to underlying ecological information. We originally developed Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) as a tool to assess, map, and quantify nonmarket values perceived by various groups of ecosystem stakeholders. With SolVES 2.0 we have extended the functionality by integrating SolVES with Maxent maximum entropy modeling software to generate more complete social-value maps from available value and preference survey data and to produce more robust models describing the relationship between social values and ecosystems. The current study has two objectives: (1) evaluate how effectively the value index, a quantitative, nonmonetary social-value indicator calculated by SolVES, reproduces results from more common statistical methods of social-survey data analysis and (2) examine how the spatial results produced by SolVES provide additional information that could be used by managers and stakeholders to better understand more complex relationships among stakeholder values, attitudes, and preferences. To achieve these objectives, we applied SolVES to value and preference survey data collected for three national forests, the Pike and San Isabel in Colorado and the Bridger-Teton and the Shoshone in Wyoming. Value index results were generally consistent with results found through more common statistical analyses of the survey data such as frequency, discriminant function, and correlation analyses. In addition, spatial analysis of the social-value maps produced by SolVES provided information that was useful for explaining relationships between stakeholder values and forest uses. Our results suggest that SolVES can effectively reproduce information derived from traditional statistical analyses while adding spatially explicit, social-value information that can contribute to integrated resource assessment, planning, and management of forests and other ecosystems. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:39","2022-10-11T14:39:39Z",NA,"68–79","","","36",NA,NA,"An application of Social Values for Ecosystem Serv",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cultural ecosystem services; Decision support; Ecosystem-based management; Geographic information system; National forests; Social-ecological systems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In these models land is generally represented on a lattice with cell states indicating the predominant land use. Since a cell can have only one state, mixed land uses and different densities of one land use can only be introduced superficially, as separate cell states. In this paper we describe a cellular automata model that simulates dynamics in both land uses and activities, where activities represent quantitative information, such as the number of inhabitants at a location. Therefore each cell has associated with it (1) a value representing one of a finite set of land-use classes, and (2) a vector of numerical values representing the quantity of each modelled activity that is present at that location. This allows simulation of incremental changes as well as mixed land uses. The proposed model is tested with a synthetic application that uses two activities: population and jobs. It simulates the emergence of human settlements over time from local inter- actions between activities and land uses. Assessment of results indicates that the model generates realistic urbanization patterns. © 2011 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:39","2022-10-11T14:39:39Z",NA,"198–212","","2","39",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As with any biological data, range maps have some level of measurement error, but this error is rarely quantified. We assessed the error associated with amphibian range maps by comparing them with point locality data. Location: Global. Methods: The maps published by the Global Amphibian Assessment were assessed against two data sets of species point localities: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and a refined data set including recently published, high-quality presence data from both GBIF and other sources. Range fit was measured as the proportion of presence records falling within the range polygon(s) for each species. Results: Using the high-quality point data provided better fit measures than using the raw GBIF data. Range fit was highly variable among continents, being highest for North American and European species (a fit of 84-94%), and lowest for Asian and South American species (a fit of 57-64%). At the global scale, 95% of amphibian point records were inside the ranges published in maps, or within 31 km of the range edge. However, differences among continents were striking, and more points were found far from range edges for South American and Asian species. Main conclusions: The Global Amphibian Assessment range maps represent the known distribution of most amphibians well; this study provides measures of accuracy that can be useful for future research using amphibian maps as baseline data. Nevertheless, there is a need for greater investment in the continuous updating and improvement of maps, particularly in the megadiverse areas of tropical Asia and South America. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:38","2022-10-11T14:39:38Z",NA,"211–221","","2","41",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Alpha-hulls; Amphibians; Conservation biogeography; Data quality; GBIF; Measurement error; Point data; Range size; Species distribution range; Wallacean shortfall","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Its ability to handle complex trade-offs in a variety of quantitative and qualitative units gives it much potential in the field of natural resource management (NRM). A key component of MODS is the process used to obtain information from decision makers on the relative importance of evaluative criteria. Ranking algorithms then use this information to determine the relative value of each decision alternative. This paper explores how practising community based NRM decision makers respond to five generic methods for weighting the criteria. It presents a study in which 55 decision makers throughout five regions in Queensland, Australia, applied MODS to evaluate environmental projects seeking funding under the Australian Natural Heritage Trust. Weighting methods applied include fixed point scoring, rating, ordinal ranking, a graphical method and paired comparisons. Decision makers evaluated each weighting method in terms of ease of use and of how much it helped clarify the decision problem. Results show that decision makers felt uncomfortable applying fixed point scoring and generally preferred to express their preferences through ordinal ranking. This has implications for the types of ranking algorithms that can be applied to evaluate the decision alternatives.",2000,"2022-10-11 14:39:38","2022-10-11T14:39:38Z",NA,"505–518","","4","43",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Challenges associated with such integration have been attributed to gaps between how human systems are organized and how ecosystems function. To address this gap, we explore the application of information ecology as a theoretical basis for integrating human systems and natural systems. First, we provide an overview of information ecology with reference to its relationship with information theory and how we define “information.” Principles governing whole-part relationships, i.e., holons and holarchies, are then used to develop a general information flow model for evolutionary, complex adaptive systems. This general model is then applied to examine a number of issues related to science–policy integration and in the development of a reference framework for practical application in adaptive management.

The model includes as variables the individual's characteristics, as well as corporal weight, the time spent on different activities, and the cost associated with each activity. We esti-mated the daily energetic demand of an adult rhea based on the activities individuals normally develop during postreproductive, nonreproductive, and reproductive seasons, differentiating between sexes. The time spent in each activity for one given animal was calculated from field observations of indi-viduals and the estimations of energetic costs for each activity were obtained from specialized literature. The model built varied between sexes because males and females have different reproductive costs. Both models have the same general formulation but they differ in the cost associated with repro-duction. In Greater Rheas, while males assume all of the incubation, the females only lay eggs communally in a single nest. Also the possibility that the individual reproduces or not was considered. The model does not allow to determine whether the energetic costs associated with the breeding are the reason why few individuals try to reproduce but it indicates that there is a clear difference in the daily energetic costs of individuals which reproduce and those which do not reproduce.

Virtually everyone now consumes resource commodities and manufactured products imported from 'elsewhere'. In effect, globalization and trade enable consuming populations to support themselves on the output of distant ecosystems half a world away. However, while economic integration implies greater 'connectivity' within the global village, the spatial separation of material production (including resource extraction) from consumption eliminates some of the signals i.e., the negative feedbacks coming from supporting eco-systems from reaching those who depend on these ecosystems for their sustainability. At present, despite increasing global connectedness, most environmental studies and models apply to a single spatial scale: local, national or global; analysing diverse pressures on human well-being and ecosystems integrity. This paper argues that both economic globalization and global ecological change should force us to add an interregional scale for quantifying and modelling sustainability. Such an approach recognizes that, in a globalizing world, the sustainability of any given region increasingly depends, directly and indirectly, on the sustainability of many other regions. The following pages describe the interregional approach and illustrate some existing and emerging methods for quantifying, analysing and modelling interregional linkages. It then identifies some of what is still missing, and discusses some of the implications in a changing world. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:39:36","2022-10-11T14:39:36Z",NA,"2615–2623","","21","221",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecological footprint analysis (EFA); Environmental input-output analysis (EIOA); International trade; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Material flows analysis (MFA); Sustainability","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we present a new terrestrial biosphere model (the Integrated Biosphere Simulator - IBIS) which demonstrates how land surface biophysics, terrestrial carbon fluxes, and global vegetation dynamics can be represented in a single, physically consistent modeling framework. In order to integrate a wide range of biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes, the model is designed around a hierarchical, modular structure and uses a common state description throughout. First, a coupled simulation of the surface water, energy, and carbon fluxes is performed on hourly timesteps and is integrated over the year to estimate the annual water and carbon balance. Next, the annual carbon balance is used to predict changes in the leaf area index and biomass for each of nine plant functional types, which compete for light and water using different ecological strategies. The resulting patterns of annual evapotranspiration, runoff, and net primary productivity are in good agreement with observations.

Comparison of the model's inferred near-equilibrium vegetation categories with a potential natural vegetation map shows a fair degree of agreement.

Online spatial databases are becoming common tools for educating land managers about Indigenous Biocultural Knowledge (IBK), specifically to raise a broad awareness of issues, identify knowledge gaps and opportunities, and to promote collaboration. Here we describe a novel approach to the application of internet and spatial analysis tools that provide an overview of publically available documented Australian IBK (AIBK) and outline the processes used to develop the online resource. By funding an AIBK working group, the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) provided a unique opportunity to bring together cross-cultural, cross-disciplinary and trans-organizational contributors who developed these resources. Without such an intentionally collaborative process, this unique tool would not have been developed. The tool developed through this process is derived from a spatial and temporal literature review, case studies and a compilation of methods, as well as other relevant AIBK papers. The online resource illustrates the depth and breadth of documented IBK and identifies opportunities for further work, partnerships and investment for the benefit of not only Indigenous Australians, but all Australians. The database currently includes links to over 1500 publically available IBK documents, of which 568 are geo-referenced and were mapped. It is anticipated that as awareness of the online resource grows, more documents will be provided through the website to build the database. It is envisaged that this will become a well-used tool, integral to future natural and cultural resource management and maintenance.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:39:36","2022-10-11T14:39:36Z",NA,"110–121","","","534",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 25682266",NA,NA,NA,"Biocultural diversity; Indigenous biocultural knowl; Indigenous biocultural knowledge; Literature review cross-cultural ecology; Socio-ecological systems; Sustainable development; Temporal mapping spatial mapping; Traditional Ecological Knowledge","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We describe the application of MSE to investigate alternative strategies for achieving EBFM goals for a complex multispecies fishery in southeastern Australia. The study was undertaken as part of a stakeholder driven process to review and improve the ecological, economic and social performance of the fishery. An integrated management strategy, involving combinations of measures including quotas, gear controls and spatial management, performed best against a wide range of objectives and this strategy was subsequently adopted in the fishery, leading to marked improvements in performance.

Watershed management is a useful tool for dealing with these issues and maintaining sustainable development at the watershed scale. The complex and uncertain characteristics of watershed systems have a great impact on decisions about countermeasures and other techniques that will be applied in the future. An optimization method based on scenario analysis is proposed in this paper as a means of handling watershed management under uncertainty. This method integrates system analysis, forecast methods, and scenario analysis, as well as the contributions of stakeholders and experts, into a comprehensive framework. The proposed method comprises four steps: system analyses, a listing of potential engineering techniques and countermeasures, scenario analyses, and the optimal selection of countermeasures and engineering techniques. The proposed method was applied to the case of the Lake Qionghai watershed in southwestern China, and the results are reported in this paper. This case study demonstrates that the proposed method can be used to deal efficiently with uncertainties at the watershed level. Moreover, this method takes into consideration the interests of different groups, which is crucial for successful watershed management. In particular, social, economic, environmental, and resource systems are all considered in order to improve the applicability of the method.

In Asia the unsustainable trade in wildlife has been identified as one of the main conservation challenges. Internationally, wildlife trade is regulated through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES) to which all Southeast Asian nations are signatory. I obtained data on international trade in CITES-listed animals in the period 1998-2007. In all \textgreater35 million animals (0.3 million butterflies; 16.0 million seahorses; 0.1 million other fish; 17.4 million reptiles; 0.4 million mammals; 1.0 million birds) were exported in this period, 30 million (∼300 species) of them being wild-caught. In addition 18 million pieces and 2 million kg of live corals were exported. Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and China are the major exporters of wild-caught animals and the European Union and Japan are the most significant importers. Over this period exports in birds significantly decreased, trade in the other taxa either increased or remained stable. For all taxa but butterflies the vast majority of individuals represent wild-caught individuals. Records of illegal or undeclared international trade are scant but can be significantly larger than levels of official exports. It is concluded that there is an urgent need for better assessments of what levels of exploitation are sustainable (including exploring appropriate proxies for Non Detriment Findings), for initiatives to make regulatory mechanisms more effective (including the introduction of minimum mandatory standards and monitoring selected wildlife trade hubs), and for better licensing and registration. Funding for at least some of these initiatives can be obtained by imposing small levies on exports of CITES-listed wildlife. ?

However, in many tropical regions records are only available from a small number of sites. This can limit the application of predictive modelling, particularly in the case of rare and endangered species. We aim to address this problem by developing a methodology for defining and mapping species pools associated with climatic variables in order to investigate potential species turnover and regional species loss under climate change scenarios combined with anthropogenic disturbance. Location: The study covered an area of 6800 km 2 in the highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Methods: We derived climatically associated species pools from floristic inventory data using multivariate analysis combined with spatially explicit discriminant analysis. We then produced predictive maps of the distribution of tree species pools using data derived from 451 inventory plots. After validating the predictive power of potential distributions against an independent historical data set consisting of 3105 botanical collections, we investigated potential changes in the distribution of tree species resulting from forest disturbance and climate change. Results: Two species pools, associated with moist and cool climatic conditions, were identified as being particularly threatened by both climate change and ongoing anthropogenic disturbance. A change in climate consistent with low-emission scenarios of general circulation models was shown to be sufficient to cause major changes in equilibrium forest composition within 50 years. The same species pools were also found to be suffering the fastest current rates of deforestation and internal forest disturbance. Disturbance and deforestation, in combination with climate change, threaten the regional distributions of five tree species listed as endangered by the IUCN. These include the endemic species Magnolia sharpii Miranda and Wimmeria montana Lundell. Eleven vulnerable species and 34 species requiring late successional conditions for their regeneration could also be threatened. Main conclusions: Climatically associated species pools can be derived from floristic inventory data available for tropical regions using methods based on mul tivariate analysis even when data limitations prevent effective application of individual species modelling. Potential consequences of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the species diversity of montane tropical forests in our study region are clearly demonstrated by the method. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:39:34","2022-10-11T14:39:34Z",NA,"262–273","","2","17",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Chiapas; Climate change; Climatic envelopes; Conservation; Disturbance; Diversity; Species distribution Modelling","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While vegetation sensitivity to climate change has been widely investigated, its spatio?temporally response to the dual effects of land management and climate change has been ignored at landscape scale. Here we use a dynamic vegetation model called FATE?HD, which describes the dominant vegetation dynamics and associated functional diversity, in order to anticipate vegetation response to climate and land?use changes in both short and long?term perspectives. Using three contrasted management scenarios for the Ecrins National Park (French Alps) developed in collaboration with the park managers, and one regional climate change scenario, we tracked the dynamics of vegetation structure (forest expansion) and functional diversity over 100 yr of climate change and a further 400 additional years of stabilization. As expected, we observed a slow upward shift in forest cover distribution, which appears to be severely impacted by pasture management (i.e. maintenance or abandonment). The time lag before observing changes in vegetation cover was the result of demographic and seed dispersal processes. However, plant diversity response to environmental changes was rapid. After land abandonment, local diversity increased and spatial turnover was reduced, whereas local diversity decreased following land use intensification. Interestingly, in the long term, as both climate and management scenarios interacted, the regional diversity declined. Our innovative spatio?temporally explicit framework demonstrates that the vegetation may have contrasting responses to changes in the short and the long term. Moreover, climate and land?abandonment interact extensively leading to a decrease in both regional diversity and turnover in the long term.

While many of these are taking the form of generic modelling frameworks, no one approach defines end-to-end ecosystem modelling. There is a wide range of scales, resolutions, forcings, components and represented processes. Examples drawn from existing models can be used to give guidance on best practice approaches for creating end-to-end models. In particular, it is clear that defaulting to the finest resolution and greatest complexity in all the dimensions (e.g. spatial, temporal, taxonomic, process detail) is not beneficial. There is also a lot of value, during model development and implementation, in trying different model types, assumptions and formulations; there is no one ""best"" model. Maintaining a diversity of approaches is important given that end-to-end models are most effective when used as strategic tools, to address questions that are at scales where there is still a lot of uncertainty about how systems function. There are still many challenges facing the end-to-end modelling field, particularly when long simulation periods are called for, but perhaps the greatest ones are: non-stationarity introduced by shifting climate, biodiversity and evolution; representing human responses; and handling uncertainty. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Government and conservation organizations faced with the task of conserving threatened species desperately need simple strategies for allocating limited resources. The academic literature dedicated to systematic priority setting usually recommends ranking species on several criteria, including level of endangerment and metrics of species value such as evolutionary distinctiveness, ecological importance, and social significance. These approaches ignore 2 crucial factors: the cost of management and the likelihood that the management will succeed. These oversights will result in misallocation of scarce conservation resources and possibly unnecessary losses. We devised a project prioritization protocol (PPP) to optimize resource allocation among New Zealand's threatened-species projects, where costs, benefits (including species values), and the likelihood of management success were considered simultaneously. We compared the number of species managed and the expected benefits gained with 5 prioritization criteria: PPP with weightings based on species value; PPP with species weighted equally; management costs; species value; and threat status. We found that the rational use of cost and success information substantially increased the number of species managed, and prioritizing management projects according to species value or threat status in isolation was inefficient and resulted in fewer species managed. In addition, we found a clear trade-off between funding management of a greater number of the most cost-efficient and least risky projects and funding fewer projects to manage the species of higher value. Specifically, 11 of 32 species projects could be funded if projects were weighted by species value compared with 16 projects if projects were not weighted. This highlights the value of a transparent decision-making process, which enables a careful consideration of trade-offs. The use of PPP can substantially improve conservation outcomes for threatened species by increasing efficiency and ensuring transparency of management decisions.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:39:33","2022-10-11T14:39:33Z",NA,"328–338","","2","23",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation planning; Conservation priorities; Cost-benefit analysis; Probability of success; Species management; Species values; Threat status","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper summarizes and integrates the results of this interdisciplinary research project into an as sessment of the designed alternatives intended to improve our understanding of landscape ecology in agricultural ecosystems and to inform agricultural policy. Scenario futures were digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS), visualized with maps and simulated images, and evaluated for multiple endpoints to assess impacts of land use change on water quality, social and economic goals, and native flora and fauna. The Biodiversity scenario, targeting restoration of indigenous biodiversity, ranked higher than the current landscape for all endpoints (biodiversity, water quality, farmer preference, and profitability). The Biodiversity scenario ranked higher than the Production scenario (which focused on profitable agricultural production) in all endpoints but profitability, for which the two scenarios scored similarly, and also ranked higher than the Water Quality scenario in all endpoints except water quality. The Water Quality scenario, which targeted improvement in water quality, ranked highest of all landscapes in potential water quality and higher than the current landscape and the Production scenario in all but profitability.

However, a recent stochastic model combining the main elements of niche theory and island biogeography theory suggests that environmental heterogeneity has a general unimodal rather than a positive effect on species richness. This result was explained by an inherent tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and the amount of suitable area available for individual species: for a given area, as heterogeneity increases, the amount of effective area available for individual species decreases, thereby reducing population sizes and increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinctions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis. First we analyze an extensive database of breeding bird distribution in Catalonia and show that patterns of species richness, species abundance, and extinction rates are consistent with the predictions of the area-heterogeneity tradeoff and its proposed mechanisms. We then perform a metaanalysis of heterogeneity-diversity relationships in 54 published datasets and show that empirical data better fit the unimodal pattern predicted by the area-heterogeneity tradeoff than the positive pattern predicted by classic niche theory. Simulations in which species may have variable niche widths along a continuous environmental gradient are consistent with all empirical findings.

Quantitative participatory exploration of the many complex issues surrounding cross-sectoral climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation under uncertain futures is dependent on the provision, in some form, of scenarios and scenario outputs. However, the normal provision by the research community of pre-defined scenario outputs results in a lack of flexibility for stakeholders regarding choice of climate models, scenarios, scenario quantification and output indicators which in turn can lead to a lack of trust. This Special Issue describes the development and application of a web-based interactive simulation and display environment, called the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment (IA) Platform, which provides a holistic (cross-sectoral, climate and socio-economic change) modelling framework. The IA Platform guides the user through simulation of (1) potential impacts under scenarios of climate and/or socio-economic change, (2) identification of sectoral and multi-sectoral vulnerability ‘hotspots' either before or after adaptation, (3) the potential for adaptation to reduce impacts within the capital constraints of the selected scenario(s), and (4) the cost-effectiveness of adaptation measures.

In coupled model systems the uncertainties propagate between the models. This paper assesses uncertainty of changes in future spatial allocation of agricultural land in Europe as they arise from a general equilibrium model coupled to a spatial land use allocation model. Two contrasting scenarios are used to capture some of the uncertainty in the development of typical combinations of economic, demographic and policy variables. The scenario storylines include different measurable assumptions concerning scenario specific drivers (variables) and parameters.Many of these assumptions are estimations and thus include a certain level of uncertainty regarding their true values. This leads to uncertainty within the scenario outcomes. In this study we have explored how uncertainty in national-level assumptions within the contrasting scenario assumptions translates into uncertainty in the location of changes in agricultural land use in Europe. The results indicate that uncertainty in coarse-scale assumptions does not translate into a homogeneous spread of the uncertainty within Europe. Some regions are more certain than others in facing specific land change trajectories irrespective of the uncertainty in the macro-level assumptions. The spatial spread of certain and more uncertain locations of land change is dependent on location conditions as well as on the overall scenario conditions. Translating macro-level uncertainties to uncertainties in spatial patterns of land change makes it possible to better understand and visualize the land change consequences of uncertainties in model input variables.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:39:31","2022-10-11T14:39:31Z",NA,"S132–S144","","","127",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In such applications the expert describes the system in terms of fuzzy variables and inference rules. The result of the fuzzy reasoning process is a numerical output value. In such a model, as in any other, the model context, structure, technical aspects, parameters and inputs may contribute uncertainties to the model output. Analysis of these contributions in a simplified model for agriculture suitability shows how important information about the accuracy of the expert knowledge in relation to the other uncertainties can be provided. A method for the extensive assessment of uncertainties in compositional fuzzy rule-based models is proposed, combining the evaluation of model structure, input and parameter uncertainties. In an example model, each of these three appear to have the potential to dominate aggregated uncertainty, supporting the relevance of an ample uncertainty approach. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems. Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions. Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between climate change and invasive species that will influence how aquatic ecosystems and their biota will respond to novel environmental conditions.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:39:31","2022-10-11T14:39:31Z",NA,"521–533","","3","22",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic systems; Climate change; Global warming; Invasive species","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An integrated model based on the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response approach was developed as a tool to assess the effects of policies for improving decision making for the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. An economic model was linked to a process-based biophysical model by a meta-model. Then, a holistic indicator-based impact assessment system was linked to the integrated model to assess policy instruments. The integrated model was applied in the intensive irrigated wheat-maize cropping system of the North China Plain in which water and nitrogen fertilizer management are known to be critical issues for sustainable resource management. The results show there is a trade-off relationship between economic return and environmental outcome. It was shown that water pricing is a more effective policy instrument for improving the sustainability of agro-ecosystem than increasing the price of nitrogen fertilizer. When the water price is raised to 1.0 Yuan/m 3 under a two-tariff system, the sustainability indicators for the irrigation water use efficiency was found to increase from 0.37 to 0.77, groundwater use sustainability increased from 0.05 to 0.60, nitrate leaching increased from 0.48 to 0.55 while the indicators for the farm gross margin, food self-sufficiency, and soil nitrogen balance remain unchanged. The results suggest the modeling approach developed here is very useful for evaluating policy options for complex natural resource management issues. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

There is a clear need to support policy-makers analyzing and assessing the impact of climate change along with land use changes. This requires a megascience infrastructure that is capable of discovering and integrating enormous volumes of multi-disciplinary data, i.e. data from biodiversity, earth observation, and climatic archives. Metadata and services interoperability is necessary. The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) works to realize such an interoperability infrastructure based on systems architecture standardization. In this paper we describe the results of linking the infrastructures of Climate Change research and Biodiversity research together using the approach envisioned by GEOSS. In fact, we present and discuss a service-oriented framework which was applied to implement and demonstrate the Climate Change and Biodiversity use scenario of the GEOSS Interoperability Process Pilot Project (IP3). This interoperability is done for the purpose of enabling scientists to do large-scale ecological analysis. We describe a generic use scenario and related modelling workbench that implement an environment for studying the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. The Service Oriented Architecture framework, which realizes this environment, is described. Its standard-based components and services, according to GEOSS requirements, are discussed.

The geographical extent of this type of peatland is highly sensitive to climate. We applied a global process-based bioclimatic envelope model, PeatStash, to predict the distribution of British blanket peatlands. The model captures the present areal extent (Kappa = 0.77) and is highly sensitive to both temperature and precipitation changes. When the model is run using the UKCIP02 climate projections for the time periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100, the geographical distribution of blanket peatlands gradually retreats towards the north and the west. In the UKCIP02 high emissions scenario for 2071-2100, the blanket peatland bioclimatic space is ∼84% smaller than contemporary conditions (1961-1990); only parts of the west of Scotland remain inside this space. Increasing summer temperature is the main driver of the projected changes in areal extent. Simulations using 7 climate model outputs resulted in generally similar patterns of declining aereal extent of the bioclimatic space, although differing in degree. The results presented in this study should be viewed as a first step towards understanding the trends likely to affect the blanket peatland distribution in Great Britain.

To do so, ecologists are widely using phenomenological models of species distributions that mainly rely on the concept of species niche and generally ignore species' demography, species' adaptive potential, and biotic interactions. This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting. We also point at a number of caveats in our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of climate change and highlight several challenges for future research.

Abstract? Species extinctions and the deterioration of other biodiversity features worldwide have led to the adoption of systematic conservation planning in many regions of the world. As a consequence, various software tools for conservation planning have been developed over the past twenty years. These tools implement algorithms designed to identify conservation area networks for the representation and persistence of biodiversity features. Budgetary, ethical, and other sociopolitical constraints dictate that the prioritized sites represent biodiversity with minimum impact on human interests. Planning tools are typically also used to satisfy these criteria. This chapter reviews both the concepts and technical choices that underlie the development of these tools. Conservation planning problems can be formulated as optimization problems, and we evaluate the suitability of different algorithms for their solution. Finally, we also review some key issues associated with the use of these tools, such as computational efficiency, the effectiveness of taxa and abiotic parameters at choosing surrogates for biodiversity, the process of setting explicit targets of representation for biodiversity surrogates, and dealing with multiple criteria. The review concludes by identifying areas for future research, including the scheduling of conservation action over extensive time periods and incorporating data about site vulnerability.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:39:27","2022-10-11T14:39:27Z",NA,"123–159","","1","31",NA,NA,"Biodiversity conservation planning tools",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer-resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.",2003,"2022-10-11 14:39:27","2022-10-11T14:39:27Z",NA,"12765–12770","","22","100",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. Bushmeat consumption in Africa and southeastern Asia, as well as the high growth-rate of per capita livestock consumption in China are of special concern. The projected land base required by 2050 to support livestock production in several megadiverse countries exceeds 30-50% of their current agricultural areas. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity. It is possible to greatly reduce the impacts of animal product consumption by humans on natural ecosystems and biodiversity while meeting nutritional needs of people, including the projected 2-3 billion people to be added to human population. We suggest that impacts can be remediated through several solutions: (1) reducing demand for animal-based food products and increasing proportions of plant-based foods in diets, the latter ideally to a global average of 90% of food consumed; (2) replacing ecologically-inefficient ruminants (e.g. cattle, goats, sheep) and bushmeat with monogastrics (e.g. poultry, pigs), integrated aquaculture, and other more-efficient protein sources; and (3) reintegrating livestock production away from single-product, intensive, fossil-fuel based systems into diverse, coupled systems designed more closely around the structure and functions of ecosystems that conserve energy and nutrients.

We argue that effective conservation of biodiversity is essential for human survival and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Despite some conservation successes (especially at local scales) and increasing public and government interest in living sustainably, biodiversity continues to decline. Moving beyond 2010, successful conservation approaches need to be reinforced and adequately financed.

This does not imply, however, that research on soil organism biodiversity and its function is irrelevant. First, it is well established that several species of the decomposer community are functionally more important than others. The 'step' hypothesis developed in this paper shows that under these conditions random loss of species is much more likely to impact ecosystem processes than expected from the redundancy hypothesis. Second, redundant species may gain functional significance by interacting with functionally important species. Third, the number of 'important species' is increased by the multiplicity of functions carried out by soil biota. And finally, alteration in species composition will not be a random process. In fact, functionally important soil biota might be among the first to be affected by large-scale changes in land use. Even if we were to accept that conservation efforts should be confined to the functionally most important species, we would have no idea how to do so. Crossing the 'spatial barrier' seems to be the biggest challenge for future investigations on soil biodiversity, because traditional approaches of community ecology will not be sufficient to answer the questions originating from large-scale impoverishment of the soil fauna. Some examples of promising macroecological topics are discussed: (i) the impact of the regional species pool on local species richness, (ii) the relationship between alpha- and gamma -diversity, and (iii) abundance-occupancy relationships. It is argued that research in this direction will be essential for answering the question of how populations and communities must be organised to resist alterations of the soil habitat at the landscape-level.

We then investigate whether spatial variation in the biomass of functional groups, over geographic (10′s km) and local (10′s m) scales, could be associated to species diversity within and among these groups. Functional community structure expressed as abundance (density, cover and biomass) and composition of major functional groups was quantified through field surveys at 20 rocky intertidal shores spanning six degrees of latitude along the southwest Atlantic coast of Argentina and extending across the boundaries between the Argentinean and Magellanic Provinces. Patterns of abundance of individual functional groups were not uniformly matched with biogeographical regions. Only ephemeral algae showed an abrupt geographical discontinuity coincident with changes in biogeographic boundaries, and this was limited to the mid intertidal zone. We identified 3-4 main 'groups' of sites in terms of the total and relative abundance of the major functional groups, but these did not coincide with biogeographical boundaries, nor did they follow latitudinal arrangement. Thus, processes that determine the functional structure of these intertidal communities are insensitive to biogeographical boundaries. Over both geographical and local spatial scales, and for most functional groups and tidal levels, increases in species richness within the functional group was significantly associated to increased total biomass and reduced spatial variability of the group. These results suggest that species belonging to the same functional group are sufficiently uncorrelated over space (i.e. metres and site-to-site) to stabilize patterns of biomass variability and, in this manner, provide a buffer, or ""insurance"", against spatial variability in environmental conditions. © 2012 Wieters et al.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:25","2022-10-11T14:39:25Z",NA,"e49725","","11","7",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to re-evaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data syntheses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably similar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made assertions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of latitude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set-variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:39:24","2022-10-11T14:39:24Z",NA,"33–46","","","384",NA,NA,"Biological effects within no-take marine reserves",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Algae; Conservation; Fishes; Invertebrates; Marine Protected Area; Marine reserves; Temperate; Tropical","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use spatially explicit models in conjunction with valuation methods to estimate comparable economic values for these services, taking account of climate change impacts.

A growing body of scholarship postulates specific attributes of boundary work that promote used and useful research. These propositions, however, are largely based on the experience of a few industrialized countries. We report here on an effort to evaluate their relevance for efforts to harness science in support of sustainability in the developing world. We carried out a multicountry comparative analysis of natural resource management programs conducted under the auspices of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. We discovered six distinctive kinds of boundary work contributing to the successes of those programs—a greater variety than has been documented in previous studies. We argue that these different kinds of boundary work can be understood as a dual response to the different uses for which the results of specific research programs are intended, and the different sources of knowledge drawn on by those programs. We show that these distinctive kinds of boundary work require distinctive strategies to organize them effectively. Especially important are arrangements regarding participation of stakeholders, accountability in governance, and the use of “boundary objects.” We conclude that improving the ability of research programs to produce useful knowledge for sustainable development will require both greater and differentiated support for multiple forms of boundary work.",2016,"2022-10-11 14:39:23","2022-10-11T14:39:23Z",NA,"4615–4622","","17","113",NA,NA,"Boundary work for sustainable development",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We test the performance of ten downscaling models in extrapolating occupancy across two orders of magnitude. To provide a greater challenge to downscaling models, we extend previous downscaling tests with plants to highly mobile insect taxa (Odonata) with a life history that is tied to freshwater bodies for reproduction. We investigate the species-level correlates of predictive accuracy for the best performing model to understand whether traits driving spatial structure can cause interspecific variation in downscaling success. Location Mainland Britain. Methods Occupancy data for 38 British Odonata species were extracted from the Dragonfly Recording Network (DRN). Occupancy at grains ≥ 100 km2 was used as training data to parameterize ten downscaling models. Predicted occupancy at the 25, 4 and 1 km2 grains was compared to observed data at corresponding grains. Model predictive error was evaluated across species and grains. Main conclusions The Hui model gave the most accurate downscaling predictions across 114 species:grain combinations and the best predictions for 14 of the 38 species, despite being the only model using information at a single spatial grain. The occupancy–area relationship was sigmoidal in shape for most species. Species' distribution type and dispersal ability explained over half of the variation in downscaling predictive error at the species level. Species with a climatic range limit in Britain were poorly predicted compared with other distribution types, and high dispersal ability was associated with relatively poor downscaling predictions. Our results suggest that downscaling models, using widely available coarse-grain atlas data, provide reasonable estimates of fine-grain occupancy, even for insect taxa with strong spatial structure. Linking species-level traits with predictive accuracy reveals general principles about when downscaling will be successful.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:22","2022-10-11T14:39:22Z",NA,"895–907","","8","20",NA,NA,"Can coarse-grain patterns in insect atlas data pre",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aggregation; Biodiversity monitoring; Distribution; Occurrence; Spatial scale","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Directly comparable data for the two periods were obtained from over 6000 km of road transect surveys carried out in protected areas, the regions around protected areas and linking highways across the country. An additional 5000 km were covered in 2000 in previously unsurveyed areas. Further data were collected from questionnaires circulated to ornithologists, wildlife experts and forestry officials. Massive declines in the populations of both species were apparent from all parts of the country, and exceeded 92% overall. The extent of declines did not differ between protected areas and elsewhere. Apparently sick birds, with drooping necks, were observed in all regions, and dead adult and juvenile vultures were frequently observed. Food availability did not decline greatly over this period. The patterns of declines and the presence of sick and dead birds indicate epidemic disease as a possible cause. If so, this is likely to be an agent to which the population is naïve, e.g. an introduced agent or one from which the species were previously isolated. Immediate steps are needed to confirm this and to identify measures that could be taken to stem the problem. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We identify conceptual and operational weaknesses in the draft RLE approach, the categories, and criteria. While species are relatively well-described units, there is no consistent means to classify ecosystems for assessing conservation status. The proposed RLE is framed mostly around certain features of ecosystems such as broad vegetation or habitat types, and do not consider major global change drivers such as climate change. We discuss technical difficulties with the proposed concept of ecosystem collapse and suggest it is not analogous to species extinction. We highlight the lack of scientific basis for the criteria and thresholds proposed by the RLE, and question the need to adopt the structure of the Red List of Species for an RLE.

Online mapping is key because it allows users to explore the spatial context of biodiversity information visually and assemble quickly the datasets needed to ask and answer biodiversity research and management questions. We make the case that free, online, global biodiversity mapping tools utilizing distributed species occurrence records are now within reach, and discuss how such a system can be built using existing technology. We also discuss additional technological and sociological challenges and solutions, given experiences building a regional distributed GIS tool called MaPSTeDI (Mountain and Plains Spatio-Temporal Database and Informatics Initiative).

Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system. Three concerns hamper the use of ecological indicators as a resource management tool. (1) Monitoring programs often depend on a small number of indicators and fail to consider the full complexity of the ecological system. (2) Choice of ecological indicators is confounded in management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives. (3) Management and monitoring programs often lack scientific rigor because of their failure to use a defined protocol for identifying ecological indicators. Thus, ecological indicators need to capture the complexities of the ecosystem yet remain simple enough to be easily and routinely monitored. Ecological indicators should meet the following criteria: be easily measured, be sensitive to stresses on the system, respond to stress in a predictable manner, be anticipatory, predict changes that can be averted by management actions, be integrative, have a known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time, and have low variability in response. The challenge is to derive a manageable set of indicators that together meet these criteria.

This report assesses India's changing food consumption patterns and their implications on future food and water demand. According to the projections made in this study, the total calorie supply would continue to increase, but the dominance of food grains in the consumption basket is likely to decrease by 2050, and the consumption of non-grain crops and animal products would increase to provide a major part of the daily calorie supply. Although the total food grain demand will decrease, the total grain demand is likely to increase with the increasing feed demand for the livestock.

In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is $125. trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and $145. trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 $US. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at $4.3-20.2. trillion/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:20","2022-10-11T14:39:20Z",NA,"152–158","","1","26",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem services; Global value; Monetary units; Natural capital","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This stimulates proliferation of pragmatic modeling techniques, such as the matrix model: ecosystem service supply is modeled using expert estimations per land use or land cover class. The matrix models popularity proves its main strengths (efficient, fast, accessible and adaptable), but also entails risks for scientific credibility and legitimacy of its results and ecosystem service assessments in general. Some of the main methodological critiques on the matrix model can be addressed especially by including measures of confidence, traceability, reliability, consistency and validity. This review presents recommendations and encourages these to become standard practise in future applications of the matrix model and related techniques.Additionally, we argue that an extended matrix model could provide more than only scientifically sound and politically legitimate results.

As a result, with integrated models we find increased complexity, where changes that used to impact only relatively contained models of subsystems, now propagate throughout the whole integrated system. This makes it harder to keep the overall complexity under control and, in a way, defeats the purpose of modularity, when efficiency is supposed to be gained from independent development of modules. Treating models only as software in solving the integration challenge may give birth to 'integronsters' - constructs that are perfectly valid as software products but ugly or even useless as models. We argue that one possible remedy is to learn to use data sets as modules and integrate them into the models. Then the data that are available for module calibration can serve as an intermediate linkage tool, sitting between modules and providing a module-independent baseline dynamics, which is then incremented when scenarios are to be run. In this case it is not the model output that is directed into the next model input, but model output is presented as a variation around the baseline trajectory, and it is this variation that is then fed into the next module down the chain. However still with growing overall complexity, calibration can become an important limiting factor, giving more promise to the integral approach, when the system is modeled and simplified as a whole. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:39:18","2022-10-11T14:39:18Z",NA,"149–158","","","39",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Calibration; Components; Integral modeling; Integrated modeling; Modularity; Module linking","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These targets, and many conservation programs, require monitoring to assess progress toward specific goals. However, comprehensive and easily understood information on biodiversity trends at appropriate spatial scales is often not available to the policy makers, managers, and scientists who require it. We surveyed conservation stakeholders in three geographically diverse regions of critical biodiversity concern (the Tropical Andes, the African Great Lakes, and the Greater Mekong) and found high demand for biodiversity indicator information but uneven availability. To begin to address this need, we present a biodiversity ""dashboard"" - a visualization of biodiversity indicators designed to enable tracking of biodiversity and conservation performance data in a clear, user-friendly format. This builds on previous, more conceptual, indicator work to create an operationalized online interface communicating multiple indicators at multiple spatial scales. We structured this dashboard around the Pressure-State-Response-Benefit framework, selecting four indicators to measure pressure on biodiversity (deforestation rate), state of species (Red List Index), conservation response (protection of key biodiversity areas), and benefits to human populations (freshwater provision). Disaggregating global data, we present dashboard maps and graphics for the three regions surveyed and their component countries. These visualizations provide charts showing regional and national trends and lay the foundation for a web-enabled, interactive biodiversity indicators dashboard.

We review the changes in the Swedish mammal and bird community in boreal forest and alpine tundra since the nineteenth century, as well as suggested drivers of change. Observed changes include (1) range expansion and increased abundance in southern birds, ungulates, and carnivores; (2) range contraction and decline in northern birds and carnivores; and (3) abundance decline or periodically disrupted dynamics in cyclic populations of small and medium-sized mammals and birds. The first warm spell, 1930-1960, stands out as a period of substantial faunal change.

We also discuss several important areas of joint IA–ES research, such as land use/land cover dynamics and the interaction between climate change and air pollution, and indicate the type of collaboration that seems to be most appropriate in each case. We find that full coupling of IA–ES models might not always be the most desirable form of cooperation, since in some cases the direct feedbacks between IA and ES may be too weak or subject to considerable process or scenario uncertainty.

Changes in demand for agricultural products and agrarian production structure are likely to have a large impact on landscape quality and the value of natural areas. Most studies address these changes either from a macro-economic perspective focusing on changes in the agricultural sector or from a local perspective by analyzing recent changes in landscapes for small case studies. This paper describes a methodology in which a series of models has been used to link global level developments influencing land use to local level impacts. It is argued that such an approach is needed to properly address the processes at different scales that give rise to the land use dynamics in Europe. An extended version of the global economic model (GTAP) and an integrated assessment model (IMAGE) are used to calculate changes in demand for agricultural areas at the country level while a spatially explicit land use change model (CLUE-s) was used to translate these demands to land use patterns at 1 km2 resolution. The global economic model ensures an appropriate treatment of macro-economic, demographic and technology developments and changes in agricultural and trade policies influencing the demand and supply for land use related products while the integrated assessment model accounts for changes in productivity as result of climate change and global land allocation. The land use change simulations at a high spatial resolution make use of country specific driving factors that influence the spatial patterns of land use, accounting for the spatial variation in the biophysical and socio-economic environment. Results indicate the large impact abandonment of agricultural land and urbanization may have on future European landscapes. Such results have the potential to support discussions on the future of the rural area and identify hot-spots of landscape change that need specific consideration. The high spatial and thematic resolution of the results allows the assessment of impacts of these changes on different environmental indicators, such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity. The global assessment allows, at the same time, to account for the tradeoffs between impacts in Europe and effects outside Europe. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:39:16","2022-10-11T14:39:16Z",NA,"57–77","","1","42",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If it is to avoid extinction, a species adapted to a moving habitat must either track its habitat spatially, or adapt genetically to the new environmental conditions. These processes of migration and evolution are important in determining continental biogeographic patterns. We develop a model to explore the relative contributions of adaptation and dispersal as alternative mechanisms whereby a population can respond to changing environmental conditions. In our model the environment to which the species is adapted moves across the landscape at a constant velocity, and a quantitative trait determines each individual's fitness as a function of the local environmental conditions. Local populations are allowed to adapt genetically to the environmental conditions at each point in space, so that a cline develops in the quantitative character. We find that if the rate of environmental movement is slow, the species will track its environment across space, otherwise it will go extinct. Additionally, the higher the genetic variance in the character, the easier it is for the species to maintain itself in a moving environment.

The satellite-based GPP algorithm uses two improved vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI, Land Surface Water Index - LSWI). The upscalling framework involves flux footprint climatology modelling and data-model fusion. This approach was first applied to an evergreen coniferous stand in the subtropical monsoon climatic zone of south China. The EC measurements at Qian Yan Zhou tower site (26°44′48″ N, 115°04′13″ E), which belongs to the China flux network and the LANDSAT and MODIS imagery data for this region in 2004 were used in this study. A consecutive series of LANDSAT-like images of the surface reflectance at an 8-day interval were predicted by blending the LANDSAT and MODIS images using an existing algorithm (ESTARFM: Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model). The seasonal dynamics of GPP were then predicted by the satellite-based algorithm. MODIS products explained 60% of observed variations of GPP and underestimated the measured annual GPP (Combining double low line 1879 g Cm -2 ) by 25-30%; while the satellite-based algorithm with default static parameters explained 88% of observed variations of GPP but overestimated GPP during the growing seasonal by about 20-25%. The optimization of the satellite-based algorithm using a data-model fusion technique with the assistance of EC flux tower footprint modelling reduced the biases in daily GPP estimations from about 2.24 g C m -2 day -1 (non-optimized, ∼43.5% of mean measured daily value) to 1.18 g C m -2 day -1 (optimized, ∼22.9% of mean measured daily value). The remotely sensed GPP using the optimized algorithm can explain 92% of the seasonal variations of EC observed GPP. These results demonstrated the potential combination of the satellite-based algorithm, flux footprint modelling and data-model fusion for improving the accuracy of landscape/regional GPP estimation, a key component for the study of the carbon cycle. © 2010 Author(s).",2010,"2022-10-11 14:39:15","2022-10-11T14:39:15Z",NA,"2943–2958","","9","7",NA,NA,"A data-model fusion approach for upscaling gross e",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Land models, which have been developed by the modeling community in the past few decades to predict future states of ecosystems and climate, have to be critically evaluated for their performance skills of simulating ecosystem responses and feedback to climate change. Benchmarking is an emerging procedure to measure performance of models against a set of defined standards. This paper proposes a benchmarking framework for evaluation of land model performances and, meanwhile, highlights major challenges at this infant stage of benchmark analysis. The framework includes (1) targeted aspects of model performance to be evaluated, (2) a set of benchmarks as defined references to test model performance, (3) metrics to measure and compare performance skills among models so as to identify model strengths and deficiencies, and (4) model improvement. Land models are required to simulate exchange of water, energy, carbon and sometimes other trace gases between the atmosphere and land surface, and should be evaluated for their simulations of biophysical processes, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation dynamics in response to climate change across broad temporal and spatial scales. Thus, one major challenge is to select and define a limited number of benchmarks to effectively evaluate land model performance. The second challenge is to develop metrics of measuring mismatches between models and benchmarks. The metrics may include (1) a priori thresholds of acceptable model performance and (2) a scoring system to combine data–model mismatches for various processes at different temporal and spatial scales. The benchmark analyses should identify clues of weak model performance to guide future development, thus enabling improved predictions of future states of ecosystems and climate. The near-future research effort should be on development of a set of widely acceptable benchmarks that can be used to objectively, effectively, and reliably evaluate fundamental properties of land models to improve their prediction performance skills.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:14","2022-10-11T14:39:14Z",NA,"3857–3874","","10","9",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Halfway through the Strategic Plan, it is time to prioritize actions in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for the Aichi Targets in 2020. Actions to achieve one target may influence other targets (downstream interactions); in turn a target may be influenced by actions taken to attain other targets (upstream interactions). We explore the interactions among targets and the time-lags between implemented measures and desired outcomes to develop a framework that can reduce the overall burden associated with the implementation of the Strategic Plan.

Environmental problems have some key features; for example they often have long time frames, are complex and concern geographically remote regions. Scientific knowledge is important in environmental policy but such knowledge is characterized by huge uncertainties. The key characteristics of both the problems and our knowledge of them should affect the evaluation of the policy instruments used to address them.

Many protected areas (PA) have been established across the region, but to date no systematic evaluation of their efficacy has been published because no comprehensive dataset was available which could be fed into an analysis of conservation gaps. We collected the geographic range for 1086 mammal species of Southeast Asia and we built species-specific habitat suitability models for 901 of them. We performed two gap analyses (one based on a combination of distribution models and distribution ranges and one based on distribution ranges only) for each mammalian species, to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing network of PA and to identify priority regions and priority species for expanding and consolidating the network. Our results indicate that 7.5-8.2% of species are not covered by any PA, and 51.6-59.1% are covered only partially. These species are distributed throughout the entire study area and their conservation requires the creation of new PA that can help fill this existing conservation gap. This would be particularly important for species which are endemic of small islands, where species survival is often threatened by the presence of introduced species and habitat conversion. Yet PAs cannot be considered as the ending point of a conservation strategy, because overall, 34% of the species we analyzed (many of which already covered by existing PAs) were at risk of extinction when considering the IUCN red-list criteria. PAs should therefore be considered in a broader framework of all local ecological and socio-economic trends, including the growing human population, growing economy and infrastructure development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To successfully protect native biodiversity from the effects of biological invasions, local conservation priorities must be established. For this purpose, fine-grained species distribution data is required but often unavailable. We present a new approach to obtain fine-grained predictions of invasion through the development of downscaled invasion maps based on coarse-grained distribution data. The framework is illustrated for the alien invader Acacia dealbata in the Northwest of Portugal. The analytical design was divided in five steps: (1) three individual coarse-grained models were calibrated and their spatial predictions were downscaled into fine-grained models using three different downscaling techniques; (2) a Downscaling Consensus Map was built by spatially combining the predictions from those three models; (3) using coarse-grained (1 km2) or fine-grained (0.04 km2) datasets, two different models were fitted and spatially projected; (4) for each spatial resolution, Conservation Value maps were produced, based on the spatial combination of the protection networks represented in the region; and (5) the spatial conflicts between the predicted distribution of the invader and Conservation Value maps were calculated and compared for the several invasion maps. The downscaled models showed high predictive performance (AUC \textgreater 0.9). The spatial projections of the different models revealed a general similarity among projections from all modelling techniques, for both the patterns of invasion and the conflicts with conservation areas. The possibility of obtaining detailed and reliable predictions based on coarse-grained distribution data could avoid costly fieldwork to collect fine-grained distribution data while effectively supporting the management of invasions at the appropriate scales.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:14","2022-10-11T14:39:14Z",NA,"2577–2590","","12","16",NA,NA,"A novel downscaling approach to predict plant inva",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Combined predictive modelling; Conservation value map; Downscaling consensus; Ensemble modelling; Species distribution models","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Including quantified, spatially explicit social value metrics in such assessments will improve the analysis of relative tradeoffs among ecosystem services. This paper describes a GIS application, Socia. l Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES), developed to assess, map, and quantify the perceived social values of ecosystem services by deriving a non-monetary Value Index from responses to a public attitude and preference survey. SolVES calculates and maps the Value Index for social values held by various survey subgroups, as distinguished by their attitudes regarding ecosystem use. Index values can be compared within and among survey subgroups to explore the effect of social contexts on the valuation of ecosystem services. Index values can also be correlated and regressed against landscape metrics SolVES calculates from various environmental data layers. Coefficients derived through these analyses were applied to their corresponding data layers to generate a predicted social value map. This map compared favorably with other SolVES output and led to the addition of a predictive mapping function to SolVES for value transfer to areas where survey data are unavailable. A more robust application is being developed as a public domain tool for decision makers and researchers to map social values of ecosystem services and to facilitate discussions among diverse stakeholders involving relative tradeoffs among different ecosystem services in a variety of physical and social contexts. © 2010.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:39:13","2022-10-11T14:39:13Z",NA,"748–760","","2","31",NA,NA,"A GIS application for assessing, mapping, and quan",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Decision support; Ecosystem assessment; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Geographic information systems; Social-ecological systems","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These data tend to be regional or national, based on different methodologies and not easily accessible. One of the few maps available is the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2005) which contains aggregated country-level information about the growing stock, biomass and carbon stock in forests for 229 countries and territories. This paper presents a technique to downscale the aggregated results of the FRA2005 from the country level to a half degree global spatial dataset containing forest growing stock; above/belowground biomass, dead wood and total forest biomass; and above-ground, below-ground, dead wood, litter and soil carbon. In all cases, the number of countries providing data is incomplete. For those countries with missing data, values were estimated using regression equations based on a downscaling model. The downscaling method is derived using a relationship between net primary productivity (NPP) and biomass and the relationship between human impact and biomass assuming a decrease in biomass with an increased level of human activity. The results, presented here, represent one of the first attempts to produce a consistent global spatial database at half degree resolution containing forest growing stock, biomass and carbon stock values.

However, quantifying the ecological effects of such policies at the regional level is difficult. A case study was conducted at the regional level in the ecologically vulnerable region of the Loess Plateau, China, through the use of several methods including the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), hydrological modeling and multivariate analysis. An assessment of the changes over the period of 2000-2008 in four key ecosystem services was undertaken to determine the effects of the Chinese government's ecological rehabilitation initiatives implemented in 1999. These ecosystem services included water regulation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and grain production. Significant conversions of farmland to woodland and grassland were found to have resulted in enhanced soil conservation and carbon sequestration, but decreased regional water yield under a warming and drying climate trend. The total grain production increased in spite of a significant decline in farmland acreage. These trends have been attributed to the strong socioeconomic incentives embedded in the ecological rehabilitation policy. Although some positive policy results have been achieved over the last decade, large uncertainty remains regarding long-term policy effects on the sustainability of ecological rehabilitation performance and ecosystem service enhancement. To reduce such uncertainty, this study calls for an adaptive management approach to regional ecological rehabilitation policy to be adopted, with a focus on the dynamic interactions between people and their environments in a changing world. © 2012 Lü et al.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:13","2022-10-11T14:39:13Z",NA,"","","2","7",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to their high transparency, the possibility to combine empirical data with expert knowledge and their explicit treatment of uncertainties, BBNs can make a considerable contribution to the ESS modelling research.

A SWOT analysis highlights the advantages and disadvantages of BBNs in ESS modelling and pinpoints remaining challenges for future research.

Many lack structure, making them difficult to understand, assess, repeat, or use for drawing generalizations across PVA studies. In an assessment comparing published PVAs and existing guidelines, we found that model selection was rarely justified; important parameters remained neglected or their implementation was described vaguely; limited details were given on parameter ranges, sensitivity analysis, and scenarios; and results were often reported too inconsistently to enable repeatability and comparability. Although many guidelines exist on how to design and implement reliable PVAs and standards exist for documenting and communicating ecological models in general, there is a lack of organized guidelines for designing, applying, and communicating PVAs that account for their diversity of structures and contents. To fill this gap, we integrated published guidelines and recommendations for PVA design and application, protocols for documenting ecological models in general and individual-based models in particular, and our collective experience in developing, applying, and reviewing PVAs. We devised a comprehensive protocol for the design, application, and communication of PVAs (DAC-PVA), which has 3 primary elements.

Assessments based on the proposed scenario framework would strengthen cooperation between integrated-assessment modelers, climate modelers and vulnerability, impact and adaptation researchers, and most importantly, facilitate the development of more consistent and comparable research within and across these research communities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:12","2022-10-11T14:39:12Z",NA,"21–35","","1","22",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Climate change; Climate impacts; Integrated assessment; Mitigation; Scenario analysis","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, there is no long-term picture of genuine change that allows one to associate species extinction risk trends with drivers of change or conservation actions. Through a review of 40 years of IUCN-related literature sources on species conservation status (e.g., action plans, red-data books), we assigned retrospective red-list categories to the world's carnivores and ungulates (2 groups with relatively long generation times) to examine how their extinction risk has changed since the 1970s. We then aggregated species' categories to calculate a global trend in their extinction risk over time. A decline in the conservation status of carnivores and ungulates was underway 40 years ago and has since accelerated. One quarter of all species (n = 498) moved one or more categories closer to extinction globally, while almost half of the species moved closer to extinction in Southeast Asia. The conservation status of some species improved (toward less threatened categories), but for each species that improved in status 8 deteriorated. The status of large-bodied species, particularly those above 100 kg (including many iconic taxa), deteriorated significantly more than small-bodied species (below 10 kg). The trends we found are likely related to geopolitical events (such as the collapse of Soviet Union), international regulations (such as CITES), shifting cultural values, and natural resource exploitation (e.g., in Southeast Asia). Retrospective assessments of global species extinction risk reduce the risk of a shifting baseline syndrome, which can affect decisions on the desirable conservation status of species. Such assessments can help conservationists identify which conservation policies and strategies are or are not helping safeguard biodiversity and thus can improve future strategies. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:12","2022-10-11T14:39:12Z",NA,"1109–1118","","4","28",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity indicators; Extinction risk; IUCN red list; Mammals; Red list index; Threats to biodiversity","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There has been considerable debate over the philosophical and methodological treatment of risk in the past few decades, ranging from its definition and classification to methods of its assessment. Probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) specifically deals with events represented by low probabilities of occurring with high levels of unfavorable consequences. Expert judgment is often a critical source of information in PRA, since empirical data on the variables of interest are rarely available. The author reviews the literature on the use of expert opinion in PRA, in particular on the approaches to eliciting and aggregating experts'assessments. The literature suggests that the methods by which expert opinions are collected and combined have a significant effect on the resulting estimates. The author discusses two types of approaches to eliciting and aggregating expert judgments-behavioral and mathematical approaches, with the emphasis on the latter. It is generally agreed that mathematical approaches tend to yield more accurate estimates than behavioral approaches. After a short description of behavioral approaches, the author discusses mathematical approaches in detail, presenting three aggregation models: non-Bayesian axiomatic models, Bayesian models, andpsychological scaling models. She also discusses issues of stochastic dependence.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:39:11","2022-10-11T14:39:11Z",NA,"","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"World Bank","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1596/1813-9450-3201",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure.

Specifically in the Alps in Switzerland, the temperature has increased twice as fast than in the rest of the Northern hemisphere. Water temperature closely follows the annual air temperature cycle, severely impacting streams and freshwater ecosystems.In the last 20 years, brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) catch has declined by approximately 40-50% in many rivers in Switzerland. Increasing water temperature has been suggested as one of the most likely cause of this decline. Temperature has a direct effect on trout population dynamics through developmental and disease control but can also indirectly impact dynamics via food-web interactions such as resource availability.We developed a spatially explicit modelling framework that allows spatial and temporal projections of trout biomass using the Aare river catchment as a model system, in order to assess the spatial and seasonal patterns of trout biomass variation. Given that biomass has a seasonal variation depending on trout life history stage, we developed seasonal biomass variation models for three periods of the year (Autumn-Winter, Spring and Summer). Because stream water temperature is a critical parameter for brown trout development, we first calibrated a model to predict water temperature as a function of air temperature to be able to further apply climate change scenarios. We then built a model of trout biomass variation by linking water temperature to trout biomass measurements collected by electro-fishing in 21 stations from 2009 to 2011.The different modelling components of our framework had overall a good predictive ability and we could show a seasonal effect of water temperature affecting trout biomass variation. Our statistical framework uses a minimum set of input variables that make it easily transferable to other study areas or fish species but could be improved by including effects of the biotic environment and the evolution of demographical parameters over time.

Any given conservation project can be described in terms of the biodiversity targets, direct threats, contributing factors at the project site, and the conservation actions that the project team is employing to change the situation. These common elements can be linked in a causal chain, which represents a theory of change about how the conservation actions are intended to bring about desired project outcomes. If project teams want to describe and share their work and learn from one another, they need a standard and precise lexicon to specifically describe each node along this chain. To date, there have been several independent efforts to develop standard classifications for the direct threats that affect biodiversity and the conservation actions required to counteract these threats. Recognizing that it is far more effective to have only one accepted global scheme, we merged these separate efforts into unified classifications of threats and actions, which we present here. Each classification is a hierarchical listing of terms and associated definitions. The classifications are comprehensive and exclusive at the upper levels of the hierarchy, expandable at the lower levels, and simple, consistent, and scalable at all levels. We tested these classifications by applying them post hoc to 1191 threatened bird species and 737 conservation projects. Almost all threats and actions could be assigned to the new classification systems, save for some cases lacking detailed information. Furthermore, the new classification systems provided an improved way of analyzing and comparing information across projects when compared with earlier systems. We believe that widespread adoption of these classifications will help practitioners more systematically identify threats and appropriate actions, managers to more efficiently set priorities and allocate resources, and most important, facilitate cross-project learning and the development of a systematic science of conservation.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:39:09","2022-10-11T14:39:09Z",NA,"897–911","","4","22",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation Measures Partnership; IUCN Red List; actions taxonomy; authority files; con- servation strategies; conservation science; direct threats to biodiversity; threats taxonomy","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"8U8FPVQH","thesis",2014,"Pitt, Joel Peter William","Abstracts from the American College of Pediatric Radiology Annual Meeting, May 14-17, 2014, Washington DC","","","","","","Invasive species are well known to cause millions of dollars of economic as well as ecological damage around the world. New Zealand, as an island nation, is fortunate because it has the opportunity to regulate and monitor travel and trade to prevent the establishment of new species. Nevertheless foreign species continue to arrive at the borders and continue to cross them, thus requiring some form of management. The control and management of a new incursion of an invasive species would clearly benefit from predictive tools that might indicate where and how quickly the species is likely to spread after it has established. During the process of spread an invasing species must interact with a complex and heterogeneous environment and the suitability of the habitat in a region determines whether it survives. Many dispersal models ignore such interactions and while they may be interesting theoretical models, they are less useful for practical management of invasive species. The purpose of this study was to create and investigate the behaviour of a spatially explicit model that simulates insect dispersal over realistic landscapes. The spatially explicit model (Modular Dispersal in GIS, MDiG) was designed as am open-source modular framework for dispersal simulation integrated within a GIS. The model modules were designed to model an an approximation of local diffusion, long distance dispersal, growth, and chance population mortality based on the underlying suitability of a region for establishment of a viable population. The spatially explicit model has at its core a dispersal module to simulate long distance dispersal based an underlying probability distribution of dispersal events. This study illustrates how to extract the frequency of long distance dispersal events, as well as their distance, from time stamped occurrence data, to fit a Cauchy probability distribution that comprises the dispersal module. An investigation of the long distance dispersal modules behaviour showed that, in general, it generated predictions of the rate of spread consistent with those of analytical partial differential and integro-difference equations. However, there were some differences. Spread rate was found to be mainly dependent on the measurement technique used to determine the invasion front or ii boundary, therefore an alternative method to determine the boundary of a population for fat-tailed dispersal kernels is presented. The method is based on the point of greatest change in population density. While previously it was thought that number of foci rather than foci size was more important in stratified dispersal and that finer resolution simulations would spread more quickly, simulations in this study showed that there is an optimal resolution for higher spread rates and rate of area increase. Additionally, much research has suggested that the observed lag at the beginning of an invasion may be due to lack of suitable habitats or low probability of individuals striking the right combination of conditions in a highly heterogeneous environment. This study shows an alternative explanation may simply be fewer dispersal event sources. A case study is described that involved the application of the spatially explicit dispersal model to Argentine ant spread to recreate the invasion history of that species in New Zealand. Argentine ant is a global invasive pest which arrived in New Zealand in 1990 and has since spread to both main islands of New Zealand, primarily through human mediated dispersal. The spatially explicit simulation model and its prediction ability were compared to that of a uniform spread model based on equivalent total area covered. While the uniform spread model gave more accurate predictions of observed occurrences early in the invasion process it was less effective as the invasion progressed. The spatially explicit model predicted areas of high probability of establishment (hot spots) consistent with where populations have been found but accuracy varied between 40-70% depending on the year of the simulation and parameter selection. While the uniform spread model sometimes slightly outperformed or was equivalent to the simulation with respect to accuracy early in the invasion process, it did not show the relative risk of establishment and was less effective later in the invasion when stochastic random events generated by the simulation model were averaged to represent trends in the pattern of spread. Additionally, probabilistic predictions as generated by the spatially explicit model allow the uncertainty of prediction to be characterised and communicated. This thesis demonstrates that heterogeneous spread models can give more insight and detail than one dimensional or homogeneous spread models but that both can be useful at different stages of the invasion process.

Climate change could further threaten the survival of the species 2 , but its forecast effects are being neglected in recovery plans 3,4 . Quantitative estimates of extinction risk under climate change have so far mostly relied on inferences from correlative projections of species' habitat shifts 5 . Here we use ecological niche models coupled to metapopulation simulations with source–sink dynamics 6,7 to directly investi-gate the combined effects of climate change, prey availabil-ity and management intervention on the persistence of the Iberian lynx. Our approach is unique in that it explicitly models dynamic bi-trophic species interactions in a climate change setting. We show that anticipated climate change will rapidly and severely decrease lynx abundance and probably lead to its extinction in the wild within 50 years, even with strong global efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In stark contrast, we also show that a carefully planned reintroduction programme, accounting for the effects of climate change, prey abundance and habitat connectivity, could avert extinction of the lynx this century. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, why considering prey availability, climate change and their interaction in models is important when designing policies to prevent future biodiversity loss. The Iberian lynx is the world's most endangered cat. Its range contracted from 40,600 km 2 in the 1950s to 1,200 km 2 in 2005 1,8 . Recent counts estimate only 250 Iberian lynx in the wild 4 . This major decline is associated closely with sharp reductions in European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) abundance 8 , caused by myxomatosis virus in the 1950s and, more recently, rabbit haemorrhagic disease 9 (RHD). Over-hunting of rabbits and the modification and fragmentation of its mixed grassland and forest habitat has exacerbated the problems of prey scarcity, because rabbits account for more than 80% of Iberian lynx consumption 10 . Non-natural mortality of Iberian lynx, such as trapping, poaching and road kills, have further reduced lynx population numbers 11 . Only two Iberian lynx populations persist in the wild at present compared with nine in the 1990s 1 .

Environmental variability is governed by power laws showing that ln difference in conditions increases with ln elapsed time at a rate of 0.3-0.4. This leads to strong but fluctuating selection in many natural populations. 2. The effect of repeated adverse change on mean fitness depends on its frequency rather than its severity. If the depression of mean fitness leads to population decline, however, severe stress may cause extinction. Evolutionary rescue from extinction requires abundant genetic variation or a high mutation supply rate, and thus a large population size. Although natural populations can sustain quite intense selection, they often fail to adapt to anthropogenic stresses such as pollution and acidification and instead become extinct. 3. Experimental selection lines of algae show no specific adaptation to elevated CO2, but instead lose their carbon-concentrating mechanism through mutational degradation. This is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the oceanic carbon pump. Elevated CO2 is also likely to lead to changes in phytoplankton community composition, although it is not yet clear what these will be.

Adaptive management is an approach to natural resource management that emphasizes learning through management based on the philosophy that knowledge is incomplete and much of what we think we know is actually wrong. Adaptive management has explicit structure, including careful elucidation of goals, identification of alternative management objectives and hypotheses of causation, and procedures for the collection of data followed by evaluation and reiteration. It is evident that adaptive management has matured, but it has also reached a crossroads. Practitioners and scientists have developed adaptive management and structured decision making techniques, and mathematicians have developed methods to reduce the uncertainties encountered in resource management, yet there continues to be misapplication of the method and misunderstanding of its purpose. Ironically, the confusion over the term ""adaptive management"" may stem from the flexibility inherent in the approach, which has resulted in multiple interpretations of ""adaptive management"" that fall along a continuum of complexity and a priori design. Adaptive management is not a panacea for the navigation of 'wicked problems' as it does not produce easy answers, and is only appropriate in a subset of natural resource management problems where both uncertainty and controllability are high. Nonetheless, the conceptual underpinnings of adaptive management are simple; there will always be inherent uncertainty and unpredictability in the dynamics and behavior of complex social-ecological systems, but management decisions must still be made, and whenever possible, we should incorporate learning into management.",2001,"2022-10-11 14:39:08","2022-10-11T14:39:08Z",NA,"","53","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"Biodiversity Support Program Washington, DC","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The review concentrates on experiences of adaptive governance of social-ecological systems during periods of abrupt change (crisis) and investigates social sources of renewal and reorganization. Such governance connects individuals, organizations, agencies, and institutions at multiple organizational levels. Key persons provide leadership, trust, vision, meaning, and they help transform management organizations toward a learning environment. Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of ?bridging organizations? seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts.

(Special Issue: 'Plastics, the environment and human health'.)","Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Biological Sciences","","","","","One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our planet is the accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines. Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. The average size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundance and global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades. However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:39:08","2022-10-11T14:39:08Z",NA,"1985–1998","","1526","364",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"coastal areas environmental management plastics wa","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But AM has arguably only rarely succeeded in improving biodiversity outcomes. There is therefore an urgent need for reflection regarding how practitioners might overcome key problems hindering greater implementation of AM. In this paper, we present the first structured review of the AM literature that relates to biodiversity and ecosystem management, with the aim of quantifying how rare AM projects actually are. We also investigated whether AM practitioners in terrestrial and aquatic systems described the same problems; the degree of consistency in how the term ‘adaptive management' was applied; the extent to which AM projects were sustained over time; and whether articles describing AM projects were more highly cited than comparable non-AM articles. We found that despite the large number of articles identified through the ISI web of knowledge (n = 1336), only 61 articles (\textless5%) explicitly claimed to enact AM. These 61 articles cumulatively described 54 separate projects, but only 13 projects were supported by published monitoring data. The extent to which these 13 projects applied key aspects of the AM philosophy – such as referring to an underlying conceptual model, enacting ongoing monitoring, and comparing alternative management actions – varied enormously. Further, most AM projects were of short duration; terrestrial studies discussed biodiversity conservation significantly more frequently than aquatic studies; and empirical studies were no more highly cited than qualitative articles. Our review highlights that excessive use of the term ‘adaptive management' is rife in the peer-reviewed literature. However, a small but increasing number of projects have been able to effectively apply AM to complex problems. We suggest that attempts to apply AM may be improved by: (1) Better collaboration between scientists and representatives from resource-extracting industries. (2) Better communication of the risks of not doing AM. (3) Ensuring AM projects “pass the test of management relevance”.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:39:08","2022-10-11T14:39:08Z",NA,"128–139","","","158",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation; Evidence-based ecosystem management; Uncertainty","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating, crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor.

Model used in identification of key variables and then articulation and then elaboration etc pg 37 If such context based assistance (Hoschka 1996) was embedded in a system, it could be amalgamated with components that facilitate the development of models. Walters (1986 p 45) discussed how; ""modelling involves two fundamental phases of thinking that alternate with one another in a kind of adaptive dance. There is an inductive, creative, synthetic, constructive phase when we try to decide what to and how to include in our caricature of reality. Then comes a deductive, more mechanical phase when use mathematical analysis and simulation, employing the caricature as a deductive engine. We then compare the deductions with expectations and, if inconsistencies are revealed, the dance continues with another round"". This 'adaptive dance' is supported by the conceptual criteria, again the emphasis on human interaction and thinking is important. As shown in the previous chapter, REDM practitioners saw the benefits of the visual spatial modelling approach and the ability to adapt the models was an essential feature. What the conceptual criteria do not specify, is active support for such development. It may be beneficial, for example to report back that a model 'overheating' could be traced back to a particular component. This could be linked to an integrated 'model status and error management' component discussed in section 9.5. Figure 59: Model building and boundary identification (three stages from top, from Walters 1986 Fig 2.4) Walters (1986) and Grayson (1995b) also describes the process by which models may be developed. As shown in Figure 59 they suggest identifying key indicators and then articulating variables and processes that directly affect the indicators and continuing until boundaries are reached where it is felt further elaboration would unnecessary. 43 ""The construction of dynamic models as an intellectual device to help people clrify issues, communicate effectively about shared concerns, and explore objectively the consequences of alternative policy options"" 56 Most participants don't have a problem with basic clock and idea of current state à rules for change à new system state 57 functional relationships straw men for criticism ""When the logical structure of submodels been decided, the modelling team closets itself to develop the simulation program"". 58 There is no fixed protocol for the actual programming flow chart, order of calculations, variable names etc ""programmers inevitably uncover logical problems with the initial formulation and parameter estimates...programmers must reconvene their subgroups...more workshops, more revisions... 58 ""at this point many participants will develop a strong parental affection for the model, and insist on using it to develop a few policy scenarios reporting back after first workshops end of 1st workshop identify research priorities and get these pearls back in the form of a report after a 'few weeks back at the office' but, forgetting times are even faster, reports get filed away, research priorities too difficult, first workshop models too deceptive and priorities identified are usually changed later ...so no deliberately no clear ending to early workshops. 61 Building Modelling Teams ""The key ingredient of AEA is an experienced modelling team"" ""Must be knowledgeable about modelling and adept at programming.They must have personality traits that are difficult to pinpoint, but include willingness to participate, ability to articulate quantitative ideas clearly in verbal terms, and willingness to quickly admit and learn from mistakes.

The management goals of our program were: (1) to maintain the population at moderate density levels preventing population irruption, (2) to reduce damage to crops and forests, and (3) to sustain a moderate yield of hunting without endangering the population. Because of significant uncertainty in biological and environmental parameters, we designed a ""feedback"" management program based on controlling hunting pressure. Three threshold levels of relative population size and four levels of hunting pressure were configured, with a choice of four corresponding management actions. Under this program, the Hokkaido Government has been promoting aggressive female culling to reduce the sika deer population since 1998. We devised a harvest-based estimation for population size using relative population size and the number of deer harvested, and found that the 1993 population size (originally estimated by extrapolation of aerial surveys) had been underestimated. To reduce observation errors, a harvest-based Bayesian estimation was developed and the 1993 population estimate was again revised. Analyses of population trends and harvest data demonstrate that hunting is an important large-scale experiment to obtain reliable estimation of population size. A serious side effect of hunting on sika deer was inadvertent lead poisoning of large birds of prey. The prohibition of the use of lead bullets by the Hokkaido Government was successful in reducing the lead poisoning, but the problem still remains. Two case studies on sika population irruption show that the densities set by maximum sustainable yield may be too high to prevent damage to agriculture, forestry, and/or ecosystems. Threshold management based on feedback control is better for ecosystem management. Since volunteer hunters favor higher hunting efficiency in resource management (e. g., venison), it is necessary to support the development of professional hunters for culling operations for ecosystem management, where lower densities of deer should be set for target areas. Hunting as resource management and culling for ecosystem management should be synergistically combined under AM. © 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:39:07","2022-10-11T14:39:07Z",NA,"373–387","","3","52",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cervus nippon; Density dependence; Feedback management; Maximum sustainable yield; Population dynamics","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, recent results suggest that over a range of nutrient concentrations, shallow lakes can have two alternative equilibria: a clear state dominated by aquatic vegetation, and a turbid state characterized by high algal biomass. This bi-stability has important implications for the possibilities of restoring eutrophied shallow lakes. Nutrient reduction alone may have little impact on water clarity, but an ecosystem disturbance like foodweb manipulation can bring the lake back to a stable clear state. We discuss the reasons why alternative equilibria are theoretically expected in shallow lakes, review evidence from the field and evaluate recent applications of this insight in lake management. © 1993.",1993,"2022-10-11 14:39:05","2022-10-11T14:39:05Z",NA,"275–279","","8","8",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Madagascar, like other globally recognized biodiversity hot spots, has complex spatial patterns of endemism that differ among taxonomic groups, creating challenges for the selection of within-country priorities. We show, in an analysis of wide taxonomic and geographic breadth and high spatial resolution, that multitaxonomic rather than single-taxon approaches are critical for identifying areas likely to promote the persistence of most species. Our conservation prioritization, facilitated by newly available techniques, identifies optimal expansion sites for the Madagascar government's current goal of tripling the land area under protection.

Much of modern-day conservation is motivated by a desire to conserve 'pristine nature' in protected areas, while there is growing recognition of the long-term human involvement in forest dynamics and of the importance of conservation outside protected areas. Agroforestry - intentional management of shade trees with agricultural crops - has the potential for providing habitats outside formally protected land, connecting nature reserves and alleviating resource-use pressure on conservation areas.

This new view is consistent with the ecosystem approach to natural resource management advocated by the Convention on Biological Diversity. This collection of six papers, which is based on a Workshop held in June-July 2004, brings together studies of biodiversity impacts of traditional agroforestry practices from Central and South America, Africa and Asia. The contributions highlight the considerable potential of traditional agroforestry practices to support biodiversity conservation, but also show their limits. These include the importance of sufficient areas of natural habitat and of appropriate hunting regulations for maintaining high levels of biodiversity in agroforestry land use mosaics, as well as the critical role of markets for tree products and of a favourable policy environment for agroforestry land uses. In combination the case studies suggest that maintaining diversity in approaches to management of agroforestry systems, along with a pragmatic, undogmatic view on natural resource management, will provide the widest range of options for adapting to changing land use conditions. © Springer 2006.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:39:05","2022-10-11T14:39:05Z",NA,"549–554","","2","15",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Conservation of wild biodiversity; Convention on Biological Diversity; Environmental service; Land use change; Natural resource management; Policy framework; Traditional agroforestry practice","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper reviews techniques available across various fields for characterising the performance of environmental models with focus on numerical, graphical and qualitative methods. General classes of direct value comparison, coupling real and modelled values, preserving data patterns, indirect metrics based on parameter values, and data transformations are discussed. In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model's aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:39:03","2022-10-11T14:39:03Z",NA,"92–105","","2012","40",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 84871801369",NA,NA,NA,"Model development; Model evaluation; Model testing; Non parametric approach; Operational flood forecasting; Performance indicators; Probabilistic forecasting; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty estimation","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This includes the effects of changing atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate, disturbances, and increasing nitrogen deposition from air pollution (Ehleringer and Field 1993, Vitousek et al. 1997). Quantification and uncertainty analysis of carbon pools and fluxes by terrestrial biota is needed to guide policy and management decisions. Unanswered questions include: (1) how and where is the terrestrial biosphere currently sequestering carbon? (2) how might forests be managed to maximize carbon sequestration? Managed carbon sequestration would have to be optimized within and among geographic regions with attention to how this might affect biodiversity and how to manage for the effects of ?natural? disturbances on carbon storage and fluxes. Processes in the terrestrial biosphere are dynamic and occur over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For example, net ecosystem production is the net effect of several large fluxes: photosynthetic uptake, and release of carbon dioxide (CO2) by respiration from autotrophs (plants) and heterotrophs (e.g., microbial decomposition). Scales range from micrometers and microseconds (e.g., cellular processes such as photosynthesis) to kilometers and centuries (e.g., decomposition of recalcitrant pools of soil carbon) (Figure 9.1). Disturbance can have a significant effect on CO2 loss to the atmosphere through decomposition of necromass such as that left from logging of forests, or pulses of CO2 to the atmosphere from fire, and through manufacturing of forest products. Interannual variation in climate can influence photosynthesis and respiration differently such that net CO2 uptake can change significantly. These factors complicate any simple scheme to quantify carbon storage and fluxes from ecosystems, yet it is important to know how disturbance and climate interact to affect biogeochemical processes for more informed management at the regional scale. Scaling strategies in terrestrial processes often involve upscaling process data at a scale smaller than the scale of interest (e.g., leaf-level photosynthesis), and combining this information with structural and environmental data to quantify process rates at the scale of interest (Aber et al. 1993, Jarvis 1995, Wu and Li, Chapters 1 and 2). Such strategies take into account the feedbacks among components (e.g., atmosphere and vegetation), and linkages across scales (e.g., leaf-standlandscape), and require that models are used and tested at each scale.In this chapter, we demonstrate an approach to using field observations, remote sensing tools, and a biogeochemistry model (Biome-BGC) in a spatially nested hierarchy (Wu 1999) to improve predictions of carbon pools, productivity, and net ecosystem production (NEP) for every square kilometer of forests in a region. We examine uncertainty in a variety of ways for the different levels of data analysis. © 2006 Springer.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:39:03","2022-10-11T14:39:03Z",NA,"3–15","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"January",NA,NA,"Springer Science & Business Media","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1007/1-4020-4663-4",NA,NA,NA,"Science","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The chapter draws on the general inclusive wealth framework of treating nature as a capital asset as discussed by Dasgupta (2009 and 2012), and elaborated for biodiversity and ecosystem services by Perrings (2012). As both authors emphasize, the main challenges in incorporating ecosystem services in wealth accounting is in determining the ecological production of ecosystem goods and services, or benefits, and the appropriate values, or shadow prices, attributed to such benefits, which are often non-marketed. Barbier (2008 and 2011a) also suggests that, in order to treat ecosystems as a form of wealth generating a flow of benefits, one first has to adopt a useful “metric” for measuring ecosystems as a form of natural capital, as well as consider ecological collapse and resilience as potential influences on this stock of wealth.

From a dietary perspective, new insights in the adverse health effects of beef and pork have lead to a revision of meat consumption recommendations. Here, we explored the potential impact of dietary changes on achieving ambitious climate stabilization levels. By using an integrated assessment model, we found a global food transition to less meat, or even a complete switch to plant-based protein food to have a dramatic effect on land use. Up to 2,700 Mha of pasture and 100 Mha of cropland could be abandoned, resulting in a large carbon uptake from regrowing vegetation. Additionally, methane and nitrous oxide emission would be reduced substantially. A global transition to a low meat-diet as recommended for health reasons would reduce the mitigation costs to achieve a 450 ppm CO2-eq. stabilisation target by about 50% in 2050 compared to the reference case.

Despite the fact that ecosystems respond to drivers at multiple time scales, most assessments of model performance do not discriminate different time scales. Spectral methods, such as wavelet analyses, present an alternative approach that enables the identification of the dominant time scales contributing to model performance in the frequency domain. In this study we used wavelet analyses to synthesize the performance of 21 ecosystem models at 9 eddy covariance towers as part of the North American Carbon Program's site-level intercomparison. This study expands upon previous single-site and single-model analyses to determine what patterns of model error are consistent across a diverse range of models and sites. To assess the significance of model error at different time scales, a novel Monte Carlo approach was developed to incorporate flux observation error. Failing to account for observation error leads to a misidentification of the time scales that dominate model error. These analyses show that model error (1) is largest at the annual and 20-120 day scales, (2) has a clear peak at the diurnal scale, and (3) shows large variability among models in the 2-20 day scales. Errors at the annual scale were consistent across time, diurnal errors were predominantly during the growing season, and intermediate-scale errors were largely event driven. Breaking spectra into discrete temporal bands revealed a significant model-by-band effect but also a nonsignificant model-by-site effect, which together suggest that individual models show consistency in their error patterns. Differences among models were related to model time step, soil hydrology, and the representation of photosynthesis and phenology but not the soil carbon or nitrogen cycles. These factors had the greatest impact on diurnal errors, were less important at annual scales, and had the least impact at intermediate time scales.

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational dis- tribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe. Location South-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain). Methods We compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada.We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three param- eters: mean elevation and upper and lower range limits. Results We found up-slope range shifts for 63% and 90% of the species in theSW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of upper range limits in the SW Alps and from changes of both range limits in the SierraNevada. The magnitudes of range shiftswere consistentwith the level of warming experienced in each region, but they also reflected the asymmet- rical warming observed along the elevation gradients. Smaller changes were observed for species reaching their historical range limits at the higher elevations, associated with a non-significant increase in temperature between periods. Main conclusions The differences observed between regions are related to the geographical position of each mountain range, which determines the characteris- tics (including thermal tolerance) of the regional species pool, and the level of warming, which determines whether maximum thermal tolerance has been exceeded for the majority of species in the region. Our results highlight the impor- tance of considering both the biogeography of the mountain and the species pool under study when assessing the sensitivity of species to future climate change in mountain regions.

Climate change is expected to strongly affect tree species distribution within these forests2,3. Climate and land use are undergoing rapid changes at present4, with initial range shifts already visible5. However, discussions on the consequences of biome shifts have concentrated on ecological issues6. Here we show that forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation may have severe economic consequences. On the basis of our model results, the expected value of European forest land will decrease owing to the decline of economically valuable species in the absence of effective countermeasures. We found that by 2100 - depending on the interest rate and climate scenario applied - this loss varies between 14 and 50% (mean: 28% for an interest rate of 2%) of the present value of forest land in Europe, excluding Russia, and may total several hundred billion Euros. Our model shows that - depending on different realizations of three climate scenarios - by 2100, between 21 and 60% (mean: 34%) of European forest lands will be suitable only for a Mediterranean oak forest type with low economic returns for forest owners and the timber industry and reduced carbon sequestration.

Climate change might impact crop yields considerably and anticipated transformations of agricultural systems are needed in the coming decades to sustain affordable food provision. However, decision-making on transformational shifts in agricultural systems is plagued by uncertainties concerning the nature and geography of climate change, its impacts, and adequate responses. Locking agricultural systems into inadequate transformations costly to adjust is a significant risk and this acts as an incentive to delay action. It is crucial to gain insight into how much transformation is required from agricultural systems, how robust such strategies are, and how we can defuse the associated challenge for decision-making. While implementing a definition related to large changes in resource use into a global impact assessment modelling framework, we find transformational adaptations to be required of agricultural systems in most regions by 2050s in order to cope with climate change. However, these transformations widely differ across climate change scenarios: uncertainties in large-scale development of irrigation span in all continents from 2030s on, and affect two-thirds of regions by 2050s. Meanwhile, significant but uncertain reduction of major agricultural areas affects the Northern Hemisphere's temperate latitudes, while increases to non-agricultural zones could be large but uncertain in onethird of regions. To help reducing the associated challenge for decision-making, we propose a methodology exploring which, when, where and why transformations could be required and uncertain, by means of scenario analysis.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:39:00","2022-10-11T14:39:00Z",NA,"124018","","12","9",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Agricultural systems; Agriculture; Climate change; Robust adaptation; Transformational change; Uncertainty","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore the estimation of MAT does not very across space and thus exhibits spatial stationarity. The interpolation of mean annual precipitation (MAP), however, is more complex and changes spatially as a function of topographic variation. Therefore, MAP shows spatial non-stationarity and must be estimated with a geographically weighted regression. A statistical transfer function (STF) of MAT was formulated using minimized residuals output from a high accuracy and high speed method for surface modeling (HASM) with an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear equation that uses latitude and elevation as independent variables, abbreviated as HASM-OLS. The STF of MAP under a BOX-COX transformation is derived as a combination of minimized residuals output by HASM with a geographically weighted regression (GWR) using latitude, longitude, elevation, impact coefficient of aspect and sky view factor as independent variables, abbreviated as HASM-GWR-BC. In terms of HASM-OLS and HASM-GWR-BC, MAT had an increasing trend since the 1960s in China, with an especially accelerated increasing trend since 1980. Overall, our data show that MAT has increased by 1.44 °C since the 1960s. The warming rates increase from the south to north in China, except in the Qinghai-Xizang plateau. Specifically, the 2,100 °C · d contour line of annual accumulated temperature (AAT) of ≥10 °C shifted northwestward 255 km in the Heilongjiang province since the 1960s. MAP in Qinghai-Xizang plateau and in arid region had a continuously increasing trend. In the other 7 regions of China, MAP shows both increasing and decreasing trends. On average, China became wetter from the 1960s to the 1990s, but drier from the 1990s to 2000s.

Conceptually, this is a direct evolution of more traditional techniques in synoptic climatology; however, the downscaling approach was developed specifically to address present needs in global environmental change research, and the need for more detailed temporal and spatial information from Global Climate Models (GCMs). Two general categories exist for downscaling techniques: process based techniques focused on nested models, and empirical techniques using one form or another of transfer function between scales. While in the long term nested models hold the greatest promise for regional-scale analysis, this approach is still in development, requires detailed surface climate data, and is dependent on high end computer availability. Conversely, empirical relationships offer a more immediate solution and significantly lower computing requirements, consequently offering an approach that can be rapidly adopted by a wider community of scientists. In this paper, an application of empirical downscaling of regional precipitation is implemented to demonstrate its effectiveness for evaluating GCM simulations and developing regional climate change scenarios. Gridded analyses of synoptic-scale circulation fields are related to regional precipitation using neural nets. Comparable GCM circulation fields are then used with the derived relationships to investigate control simulation and doubled atmospheric CO2 simulation synoptic-scale forcing on regional climates",1996,"2022-10-11 14:38:59","2022-10-11T14:38:59Z",NA,"85–95","","2","7",NA,NA,"Climate downscaling: techniques and application.

Previous work showed that T. alpinus responded to warming in the park by retracting its lower elevational limit upslope by more than 500 m, whereas the closely related chipmunk T. speciosus remained stable. Consistent with a reduced and more fragmented range, we found a decline in overall genetic diversity and increased genetic subdivision in T. alpinus.

Humans use two distinct mental modes to deal with salient information: analytic processing and experiential processing. Tools combining both modes of processing can help societal actors seeking to stimulate active and informed environmental governance to facilitate both understanding of and engagement with social-ecological systems. In this paper, we combine two tools, each geared to one mode of communication. The System Perspectives Scope is a tool aimed at eliciting and sharing analytic perspectives on social-ecological systems change. ScenarioCommunities facilitates the communication of perspectives on the future in an engaging experiential mode. We applied these two tools in two scenario workshops in Oxfordshire. Each workshop featured the tools in a different order to compare the effects across tools. The System Perspectives Scope was able to elicit participants' analytic perspectives and let them reflect on the systems they described. ScenarioCommunities communicated animated scenario storyline segments in a vivid and engaging experiential mode. This stimulated participants to create individual, experiential perspectives on the scenarios. The workshop that started with experiential engagement yielded reinforcing effects of the first tool on the second. This study shows that analytic and experiential communication can be used to generate both understanding of and engagement with social-ecological systems change. The study also indicates that the social-ecological systems frame used to develop these tools entails that they offer complementary advantages when compared to tools used in participatory landscape ecology and participatory modeling. © 2012.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:58","2022-10-11T14:38:58Z",NA,"203–213","","3","107",NA,NA,"Combining analytic and experiential communication",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Communication; Public participation; Scenarios; Social-ecological systems change; Visualization","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used these methods in a case study of management of the non-native invasive species gray sallow willow (Salix cinerea) in alpine Australia. Establishment of this species is facilitated by wildfire. Managers are charged with developing a management strategy despite extensive uncertainty regarding the frequency of fires, the willow's demography, and the effectiveness of management actions. We worked with managers in Victoria to conduct a formal decision analysis. We used a dynamic model to identify the best management strategy for a range of budgets. We evaluated the robustness of the strategies to uncertainty with value-of-information analyses. Results of the value-of-information analysis indicated that reducing uncertainty would not change which management strategy was identified as the best unless budgets increased substantially. This outcome suggests there would be little value in implementing adaptive management for the problem we analyzed. The value-of-information analyses also highlighted that the main driver of gray sallow willow invasion (i.e., fire frequency) is not necessarily the same factor that is most important for decision making (i.e., willow seed dispersal distance). Value of-information analyses enables managers to better target monitoring and research efforts toward factors critical to making the decision and to assess the need for adaptive management. ? 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:57","2022-10-11T14:38:57Z",NA,"810–820","","5","26",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptive management; Decision model; Gray sallow willow; Non-native invasive species; Salix cinerea","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Case studies from Canada and New Zealand emphasize that, although traditional monitoring methods may often be imprecise and qualitative, they are nevertheless valuable because they are based on observations over long time periods, incorporate large sample sizes, are inexpensive, invite the participation of harvesters as researchers, and sometimes incorporate subtle multivariate cross checks for environmental change. A few simple rules suggested by traditional knowledge may produce good management outcomes consistent with fuzzy logic thinking. Science can sometimes offer better tests of potential causes of population change by research on larger spatial scales, precise quantification, and evaluation of population change where no harvest occurs. However, science is expensive and may not always be trusted or welcomed by customary users of wildlife. Short scientific studies in which traditional monitoring methods are calibrated against population abundance could make it possible to mesh traditional ecological knowledge with scientific inferences of prey population dynamics.

There are a wide range of views on the utility of such statements for risk communication, and they are often seen as being central to the failure to generate common understanding about risks between science and non-scientists. The extent to which probability statements are understood is unclear. If such statements are misunderstood by many, what alternatives might communicate uncertainty better? These questions are examined in the context of daily weather forecasts. The probabilities used in such statements concern daily events experienced by everyone, unlike the extremely small probabilities about unfamiliar events often used in risk communication. If people do not understand weather forecasts, there is little hope that statements about unfamiliar events using unfamiliar language will be understood. Some jurisdictions use numerical probabilistic statements on the likelihood of precipitation, and a variety of qualitative or categorical forecasts are also used. Drawing on a range of sources including public surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the paper examines public understanding of probabilities and public and specialist understanding of verbal categorical forecast terms. The majority of those surveyed have basic understanding about probabilities as used in weather forecasts, but significant groups do not. However, there was limited agreement among forecasters on what the probabilistic statements meant. Similarly, there was limited shared meaning between forecasters and the public on the verbal forecast expression examined. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Interactions between changing demands for agricultural land and vegetation processes leading to the re-growth of (semi-) natural vegetation on abandoned farmland are explicitly addressed. Succession of natural vegetation is simulated based on the spatial variation in biophysical and management related conditions, while the dynamics of the agricultural area are determined by a global multi-sector model. The results allow an exploration of the future dynamics of European land use and landscapes.

Threats are often quantified through higher level proxies, such as the human footprint (HF). We tested the effects that multiple methods of representing species' distribution and different quantifications of a HF map have on threat measurement, and how these influence conservation decisions. We quantified the magnitude of HF for 901 Southeast Asian mammals according to several methods. We ranked the species according to the measured HF value, and produced priority lists of top-impacted species. The different representations of species' distribution caused significant disagreement in HF calculations. HF values were on average lower when calculated in species' suitable habitat or occurrence points in comparison to the whole geographic range. Biases were non-linear and dependent on distal factors, such as the proportion of suitable habitat within species' range and species' habitat specialism. Using different HF quantifications also yielded disagreement, with 2-56% difference observed in species membership among priority lists. Threatened species were best predicted, and significantly placed in the top-ranking, when measuring their proportion of range exposed to high levels of HF. We thus show that the HF extent, not only its average value, determines species extinction risk. A well-framed global conservation strategy must address the quantification of human impact on biodiversity. The selection of quantification methods has implications for how such impact is evaluated. Improving techniques to quantify biodiversity threats will enhance the effectiveness of extinction risk analyses and conservation decisions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:56","2022-10-11T14:38:56Z",NA,"203–211","","","165",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Extinction risk; Human impact; IUCN Red List; Species distribution; Suitable habitat; Threatened mammal species","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This article presents a conceptual framework for such evaluations and a four-step approach: defining the focal concern; developing criteria and synthesizing observations on the extent to which the focal concern is met; identifying and assessing all policies contributing to this outcome; and complementing this with the evaluation of policies specifically aimed at meeting the focal concern.

At the continental scale, niche-based models have been widely used in the last 10 years to predict the potential impacts of climate change on species distributions all over the world, although these models do not include any mechanistic relationships. In contrast, species-specific, process-based predictions remain scarce at the continental scale. This is regrettable because to secure relevant and accurate predictions it is always desirable to compare predictions derived from different kinds of models applied independently to the same set of species and using the same raw data. Here we compare predictions of range shifts under climate change scenarios for 2100 derived from niche-based models with those of a process-based model for 15 North American boreal and temperate tree species. A general pattern emerged from our comparisons: niche-based models tend to predict a stronger level of extinction and a greater proportion of colonization than the process-based model. This result likely arises because niche-based models do not take phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation into account. Nevertheless, as the two kinds of models rely on different assumptions, their complementarity is revealed by common findings. Both modeling approaches highlight a major potential limitation on species tracking their climatic niche because of migration constraints and identify similar zones where species extirpation is likely. Such convergent predictions from models built on very different principles provide a useful way to offset uncertainties at the continental scale. This study shows that the use in concert of both approaches with their own caveats and advantages is crucial to obtain more robust results and that comparisons among models are needed in the near future to gain accuracy regarding predictions of range shifts under climate change.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:38:56","2022-10-11T14:38:56Z",NA,"1301–13","","5","90",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 19537550",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To cope with these challenges, conservation planners are increasingly turning to the tools of decision analysis, especially dynamic optimization methods. Here we provide a general framework for optimal, dynamic conservation and then explore its capacity for coping with various sources and degrees of uncertainty. In broadest terms, the dynamic optimization problem in conservation is choosing among a set of decision options at periodic intervals so as to maximize some conservation objective over the planning horizon. Planners must account for immediate objective returns, as well as the effect of current decisions on future resource conditions and, thus, on future decisions. Undermining the effectiveness of such a planning process are uncertainties concerning extant resource conditions (partial observability), the immediate consequences of decision choices (partial controllability), the outcomes of uncontrolled, environmental drivers (environmental variation), and the processes structuring resource dynamics (structural uncertainty). Where outcomes from these sources of uncertainty can be described in terms of probability distributions, a focus on maximizing the expected objective return, while taking state-specific actions, is an effective mechanism for coping with uncertainty. When such probability distributions are unavailable or deemed unreliable, a focus on maximizing robustness is likely to be the preferred approach. Here the idea is to choose an action (or state-dependent policy) that achieves at least some minimum level of performance regardless of the (uncertain) outcomes. We provide some examples of how the dynamic optimization problem can be framed for problems involving management of habitat for an imperiled species, conservation of a critically endangered population through captive breeding, control of invasive species, construction of biodiversity reserves, design of landscapes to increase habitat connectivity, and resource exploitation. Although these decision making problems and their solutions present significant challenges, we suggest that a systematic and effective approach to dynamic decision making in conservation need not be an onerous undertaking. The requirements are shared with any systematic approach to decision making - a careful consideration of values, actions, and outcomes. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:55","2022-10-11T14:38:55Z",NA,"25004","","2","8",NA,NA,"Confronting dynamics and uncertainty in optimal de",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"adaptive management; conservation planning; decision analysis; optimization; robustness; uncertainty","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Decomposition is driven by a vast diversity of organisms that are structured in complex food webs. Identifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of biodiversity on decomposition is critical given the rapid loss of species worldwide and the effects of this loss on human well-being. Yet despite comprehensive syntheses of studies on how biodiversity affects litter decomposition, key questions remain, including when, where and how biodiversity has a role and whether general patterns and mechanisms occur across ecosystems and different functional types of organism. Here, in field experiments across five terrestrial and aquatic locations, ranging from the subarctic to the tropics, we show that reducing the functional diversity of decomposer organisms and plant litter types slowed the cycling of litter carbon and nitrogen. Moreover, we found evidence of nitrogen transfer from the litter of nitrogen-fixing plants to that of rapidly decomposing plants, but not between other plant functional types, highlighting that specific interactions in litter mixtures control carbon and nitrogen cycling during decomposition. The emergence of this general mechanism and the coherence of patterns across contrasting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems suggest that biodiversity loss has consistent consequences for litter decomposition and the cycling of major elements on broad spatial scales.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:38:55","2022-10-11T14:38:55Z",NA,"218–221","","7499","509",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted a series of qualitative focus groups with five different stakeholder groups connected to a small-scale Kenyan coastal fishery to understand (1) how well-being is understood within the community, and what is important for well-being, (2) how people's well-being has been affected by changes over the recent past, and (3) people's hopes and aspirations for their future fishery. Our results show that people conceive well-being in a diversity of ways, but that these can clearly map onto the MA framework.

They offer significant advantages over static, correlative modelling approaches, particularly for ecosystems that are outside their equilibrium due to global change or climate change. A persistent problem, however, is their parameterization. Parameters and processes of dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are traditionally determined independently of the model, while model outputs are compared to empirical data for validation and informal model comparison only. But field data for such independent estimates of parameters and processes are often difficult to obtain, and the desire to include better descriptions of processes such as biotic interactions, dispersal, phenotypic plasticity and evolution in future vegetation models aggravates limitations related to the current parameterization paradigm. In this paper, we discuss the use of Bayesian methods to bridge this gap. We explain how Bayesian methods allow direct estimates of parameters and processes, encoded in prior distributions, to be combined with inverse estimates, encoded in likelihood functions. The combination of direct and inverse estimation of parameters and processes allows a much wider range of vegetation data to be used simultaneously, including vegetation inventories, species traits, species distributions, remote sensing, eddy flux measurements and palaeorecords. The possible reduction of uncertainty regarding structure, parameters and predictions of DVMs may not only foster scientific progress, but will also increase the relevance of these models for policy advice. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:55","2022-10-11T14:38:55Z",NA,"2240–2252","","12","39",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Bayesian statistics; Calibration; Data assimilation; Forest models; Inverse modelling; Model selection; Parameterization; Plant functional types; Predictive uncertainty; Process-based models","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is in part because flows of ecosystem services remain poorly characterized at local-to-regional scales, and their protection has not generally been made a priority. We used a spatially explicit conservation planning framework to explore the trade-offs and opportunities for aligning conservation goals for biodiversity with six ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood control, forage production, outdoor recreation, crop pollination, and water provision) in the Central Coast ecoregion of California, United States. We found weak positive and some weak negative associations between the priority areas for biodiversity conservation and the flows of the six ecosystem services across the ecoregion. Excluding the two agriculture-focused services-crop pollination and forage production-eliminates all negative correlations. We compared the degree to which four contrasting conservation network designs protect biodiversity and the flow of the six services. We found that biodiversity conservation protects substantial collateral flows of services. Targeting ecosystem services directly can meet the multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity goals more efficiently but cannot substitute for targeted biodiversity protection (biodiversity losses of 44% relative to targeting biodiversity alone). Strategically targeting only biodiversity plus the four positively associated services offers much promise (relative biodiversity losses of 7%). Here we present an initial analytical framework for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in conservation planning and illustrate its application. We found that although there are important potential trade-offs between conservation for biodiversity and for ecosystem services, a systematic planning framework offers scope for identifying valuable synergies.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:38:54","2022-10-11T14:38:54Z",NA,"2138–2152","","11","4",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Conservation planning analyses to date have generally assumed that land is either protected or unprotected, and that the unprotected portion does not contribute to conservation goals. We develop and apply a new planning approach that explicitly accounts for the contribution of a diverse range of land uses to achieving conservation goals. Using East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) as a case study, we prioritize investments in alternative conservation strategies and account for the relative contribution of land uses ranging from production forest to well-managed protected areas. We employ data on the distribution of mammals and assign species-specific conservation targets to achieve equitable protection by accounting for life history characteristics and home range sizes. The relative sensitivity of each species to forest degradation determines the contribution of each land use to achieving targets. We compare the cost effectiveness of our approach to a plan that considers only the contribution of protected areas to biodiversity conservation, and to a plan that assumes that the cost of conservation is represented by only the opportunity costs of conservation to the timber industry. Our preliminary results will require further development and substantial stakeholder engagement prior to implementation; nonetheless we reveal that, by accounting for the contribution of unprotected land, we can obtain more refined estimates of the costs of conservation. Using traditional planning approaches would overestimate the cost of achieving the conservation targets by an order of magnitude.

Our findings suggest that they should. By analysing Norwegian quarterly time series data we find that changes in the age distribution of the population have significant and life cycle consistent effects on aggregate consumption. Furthermore, controlling for age structure effects stabilizes the other parameters of the consumption function and reveals significant real interest rate effects.

Recent changes in climate have led to significant shifts in phenology, with many studies demonstrating advanced phenology in response to warming temperatures. The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21 years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1 °C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05-0.2 days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species - especially for early-flowering species - while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species' phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:38:53","2022-10-11T14:38:53Z",NA,"4651–4661","","12","21",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Arctic tundra; Bayesian hierarchical modeling; Climate change; Flowering time; Interval censoring; Plant phenology; Seed maturation","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, these intuitive distinctions can become blurred when comparing species distribution modelling approaches in more detail. In this review article, we contrast the extremes of the correlative-process spectrum of species distribution models with respect to core assumptions, model building and selection strategies, validation, uncertainties, common errors and the questions they are most suited to answer. The extremes of such approaches differ clearly in many aspects, such as model building approaches, parameter estimation strategies and transferability. However, they also share strengths and weaknesses. We show that claims of one approach being intrinsically superior to the other are misguided and that they ignore the process-correlation continuum as well as the domains of questions that each approach is addressing. Nonetheless, the application of process-based approaches to species distribution modelling lags far behind more correlative (process-implicit) methods and more research is required to explore their potential benefits. Critical issues for the employment of species distribution modelling approaches are given, together with a guideline for appropriate usage.

Connecting to the ongoing discussion on uncertainty classifications in futures studies, we discuss the characteristics of scenario studies and the way uncertainty is embedded in several scenario studies on climate change in the Netherlands, as well as in the policy process. Both the users and the producers of scenario studies are analyzed in how they deal with uncertainty. Supported by the empirical evidence we will show that not only miscommunication happens in the entire policy making process because policy makers have their own reality and way of dealing with uncertainty, but also show how scientists themselves struggle with uncertainty, sometimes taking the role of policy advocates wanting to influence decision-making.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are central to extinction risk analyses. The reliability of predictions of SDMs has been questioned because models often lack a mechanistic underpinning and rely on assumptions that are untenable under climate change. We show how integrating predictions from fundamentally different modeling strategies produces robust forecasts of climate change impacts on habitat and population parameters. We illustrate the principle by applying mechanistic (Niche Mapper) and correlative (Maxent, Bioclim) SDMs to predict current and future distributions and fertility of an Australian gliding possum. The two approaches make congruent, accurate predictions of current distribution and similar, dire predictions about the impact of a warming scenario, supporting previous correlative-only predictions for similar species.

However, recent bark beetle population eruptions have exceeded the frequencies, impacts, and ranges documented during the previous 125 years. Extensive host abundance and susceptibility, concentrated beetle density, favorable weather, optimal symbiotic associations, and escape from natural enemies must occur jointly for beetles to surpass a series of thresholds. and exert widespread disturbance. Opposing feedbacks determine qualitatively distinct outcomes at junctures at the biochemical through landscape levels. Eruptions occur when key thresholds are surpassed, prior constraints cease to exert influence, and positive feedbacks amplify across scales. These dynamics are bidirectional, as landscape features influence how lower-scale processes are amplified or buffered.

We examine fire regimes in forests of western North America, focusing on how observed patterns of fire frequency change across spatial scales. To quantify changes in fire frequency across spatial scale, we derive the event-area (EA) relationship and the analogous interval-area (IA) relationship using historical and simulated data from low- and high-severity fire regimes. The EA and IA provide multi-scale descriptions of fire regimes, as opposed to standard metrics that may apply only at a single scale. Parameters and properties of scaling functions (intercept, slope, minimum value) are associated statistically with properties of the fire regime, such as mean fire-free intervals and fire size distributions, but are not direct mathematical transformations of them because they also reflect mechanistic drivers of fire that are non-stationary in time and space. Patterns in fire-scaling relations can be used to identify how controls on fire regimes change across spatial and temporal scales.

Indeed, in both groups we observed: (i) a significantly uneven distribution of species richness across countries and geographic regions with highest species richness peaks being in Middle Africa and lowest peaks in Northern Africa, (ii) species richness increasing with rainfall but being independent on a country's surface area, (iii) in each country, the insectivore total species richness and endemic species richness increases were positively correlated with rodent total species richness and endemic species richness increases. However, number of endemics peaked in South Africa and D. R. Congo in both groups, but also in Tanzania for Insectivores and in Ethiopia for rodents. In addition, the highest numbers of threatened species occurred in D. R. Congo, Rwanda and Uganda for rodents and in South Africa, Tanzania and Cameroon for insectivores.

At the same time, the set ing in which policy-makers must work has never been so complex and uncertain. And now the backdrop to this increasing urgency is a worsening global economic crisis, the likes of which most of us have never experienced—a crisis that came as a surprise to the majority of policy-makers. We are in danger of approaching a perfect storm of global crises. A global food crisis reared its head early in 2008 and has not gone away, and the impacts of climate change are manifesting themselves faster than was projected some years ago as carbon continues to accumulate in our atmosphere at unprecedented rates. But with these unfortunate experiences we are learning some important lessons about our economy, society and environment. For example, the economic crisis illustrates just how interconnected our local and global economies have become. T e food crisis has reminded us of the vulnerability of the poor to f uctuations in market prices for our most fundamental commodities. T e climate change issue has illustrated the interconnections among our economy, our society and our environment. T e carbon fuelling our economy is changing the global environment on a scale never experienced before. It is indeed a very complex, dynamic and uncertain world. T is is the stage on which policy-makers try to improve the lot of their citizens. Our respective organizations—the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and T e Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)—strive to help governments incorporate the principles of sustainability into decisionmaking. Among these principles are: that we understand and appreciate the inherent interconnectedness of the pressing economic, social and environmental issues; that those who have much should be accountable to those who have lit le; and that we, as the present generation, are accountable to the next generation of citizens who have no voice in today's decisions. Advancing public policies and business decisions that put these principles into action is the mark of a mature society. Doing so is a daunting task even under the best and most stable of conditions. But today's conditions are far from stable. Put ing these principles into practice, when the operating environment x Creating Adaptive Policies of a policy is highly dynamic, unpredictable and uncertain—as is the reality for most of today's pressing issues—is extremely dif cult. An unprepared policy in such a set ing has a good chance of not achieving its objective or having unintended negative consequences, or both. Such policies become a hindrance to advancing quality of life and sustainability. Creating Adaptive Policies was writ en to help policy-makers navigate today's complex, dynamic and uncertain terrain—to help policies help people. T e authors began with an extensive search of the literature. What at f rst sounded like solos on how to deal with such complex policy set ings from disparate sectors—including business, transportation engineering, healthcare, natural resources and Internet communications, to name a few— became a symphony when the lessons learned from across this range of economic sectors were all heard together. A common thread in these lessons was an appreciation of the policy environment as a complex adaptive system, a conceptual understanding that illuminated many important characteristics of how people interact among themselves and with their environment. T e authors then listened to the people on the ground most impacted by public policies, including farmers and water resource managers in Canada and India. Policies that helped these persons deal with the dynamics and uncertainty of f uctuations in weather exhibited many of the adaptive features that were observed in the literature. Contained in the chapters of this book are seven tools that have helped policy-makers design and implement policies that perform in highly dynamic and uncertain set ings. Adaptive policies anticipate the array of conditions that lie ahead through robust design using: (1) integrated and forward-looking analysis, including scenario planning; (2) multi-stakeholder deliberation to illuminate potential pitfalls and unintended consequences and (3) by monitoring key performance indicators to trigger automatic policy adjustments. But not all situations can be anticipated in advance through diligent use of analytical and deliberative tools. Adaptive policies are also able to navigate towards successful outcomes in set ings that cannot be anticipated in advance. T e book describes how this can be done by working in concert with certain characteristics of complex adaptive systems, including: (1) enabling self-organizing and social networking in communities (2) decentralizing decision-making to the lowest, and most ef ective and accountable unit of governance; (3) promoting variation in policy responses; and through (4) regular and systematic policy review and improvement—always examining whether assumptions about intended outcomes are accurate. As introduced in Chapter 1, these seven tools are being applied by policymakers and managers in many economic sectors to deal with a variety of policy issues. If you are a policy-maker working on the climate change issue you will f nd this book useful for craf ing policies to tackle both mitigation and adaptation. If you are dealing with agriculture or water resource management issues, you will relate to many of the case examples presented in the book. Regardless of the arena of public policy and governance for which you have responsibility, we are conf dent that this book will be a welcome addition to your toolbox.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:38:51","2022-10-11T14:38:51Z",NA,"1–11","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"IISD","Ottawa","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unfortunately, identifying local conservation priorities requires high-resolution data on species distribution, and these are often unavailable. Atlases of species distribution provide data for several groups of organisms in many different areas but are often too coarse in resolution to provide valuable information. We explored the possibility of cross-scale modelling species distributions and we clarified, for the first time, its effect on prioritization exercises. We used different modelling techniques for scaling down atlas data for Sardinian reptiles, validated the outcomes with detailed, field-sampled data, and compared conservation priorities deriving from atlas maps and downscaled models. Doing this, we obtained as a further result the identification of priority species and areas for future conservation strategies. Our results encourage us to experiment further with this approach. Through the downscaling procedure, we obtain high-resolution models with strong variations in predictive performances, although most of the models show satisfactory/excellent scores. This testifies that low-resolution data can be downscaled maintaining low rates of omission and commission errors. Increasing the resolution of distribution maps used for prioritization influences the spatial patterns of priority but does not modify the evaluation of species representation. Overall, we show that atlases can meet the large demand for distribution data by decision makers if appropriate downscaling procedures are adopted. In addition, we provide practical instruments for the conservation of reptiles in Sardinia by identifying priority species and areas that require strict management.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:50","2022-10-11T14:38:50Z",NA,"378–387","","4","15",NA,NA,"Cross-scale predictions allow the identification o",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Atlas maps; Distribution models; Downscaling; Gap analysis; Irreplaceability","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This often takes place in the absence of reliable information on the population size, and as a consequence, quotas are set in an arbitrary fashion, leading to population decline and revenue loss. In this investigation, we show how an indirect measure of abundance can be used to set quotas in a sustainable manner, even in the absence of information on population size. Focusing on lion hunting in Africa, we developed a simple algorithm to convert changes in the number of safari days required to kill a lion into a quota for the following year. This was tested against a simulation model of population dynamics, accounting for uncertainties in demography, observation, and implementation. Results showed it to reliably set sustainable quotas despite these uncertainties, providing a robust foundation for the conservation of hunted species.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:38:50","2022-10-11T14:38:50Z",NA,"539–543","","1","111",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As model complexity increases, it becomes more difficult to trace how imperfect knowledge of internal model parameters, data inputs, or relationships among parameters might impact model results, affecting predictions and subsequent management decisions. Sensitivity analysis is an essential component of model evaluation, particularly when models are used to make management decisions. Results should be expressed as probabilities and should realistically account for uncertainty. When models are particularly complex, this can be difficult to do and to present in ways that do not obfuscate essential results. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment (EDT) model, which predicts salmon productivity and capacity as a function of ecosystem conditions. We used a novel ""structured sensitivity analysis"" approach that is particularly useful for very complex models or those with an abundance of interconnected parameters. We identified small, medium, and large plausible ranges for both input data and model parameters. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we explored the variation in output, prediction intervals, and sensitivity indices, given these plausible input distributions. The analyses indicated that, as a consequence of internal parameter uncertainty, EDT productivity and capacity predictions lack the precision needed for many management applications. However, EDT prioritization of reaches for preservation or restoration was more robust to given input uncertainties, indicating that EDT may be more useful as a relative measure of fish performance than as an absolute measure. Like all large models, if EDT output is to be used as input to other models or management tools it is important to explicitly incorporate the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses into such secondary analyses.

We conducted the first large-scale (entire fishery) assessment of bottom trawl fishing on the biomass, production and species richness of benthic fauna in different habitats, using a theoretical model validated with extensive field data. The size-based model consisted of 37 body size-classes of animals. Sediment, shear stress, erosion and chlorophyll content of the sediment were included as habitat features that affected the growth and mortality of the animals. Species richness was estimated based on the assumption that species become locally extinct when adult biomass is reduced below a critical threshold, and a generalised body mass versus species richness relationship. The model was validated using benthic biomass, production and species richness estimates from 33 stations subject to a range of trawling intensities, in 4 areas in the North Sea. Both the model and the field data demonstrated that trawling reduced the total biomass, production and species richness of benthic communities, and that the extent of the impact depended on habitat-type. The model predicted that the impacts of trawling were greatest in areas with low levels of natural disturbance, while the impact of trawling was small in areas with high rates of natural disturbance. For the southern North Sea, the validated model predicted that the fishing activities of the international bottom trawl fleet, reduced benthic biomass and production by 56% and 21% respectively, compared to an unfished situation. The precision of these estimates is unknown. Our model enables managers to understand the consequences of altering the amount of fishing activities on benthic production and hence food web processes.

To do EBFM, one of the key tools will be to use ecosystem models. To fully use ecosystem models and have their outputs adopted, there is an increasingly recognized need to address uncertainty associated with such modeling activities. Here we characterize uncertainty as applied to ecosystem models into six major factors, including: natural variability; observation error; inadequate communication among scientists, decision-makers and stakeholders; the structural complexity of the model(s) used; outcome uncertainty; and unclear management objectives. We then describe best practices to address each of these uncertainties as they particularly apply to ecosystem models being used in a LMR management context. We also present case studies to highlight examples of how these best practices have been implemented. Although we acknowledge that this work was compiled by ecosystem modelers in an LMR management context primarily for other ecosystem modelers, the principles and practices described herein are also germane for managers, stakeholders and other natural resource management communities. We conclude by emphasizing not only the need to address uncertainty in ecosystem models, but also the feasibility and benefits of doing so. © 2012.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:49","2022-10-11T14:38:49Z",NA,"102–114","","","102",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Genetic constraints occur when additive genetic variance in selectively favored directions is absent (absolute constraints) or present but small (quantitative constraints). Quantitative–unlike absolute–constraints are presumed surmountable given time. This ignores that a population might become extinct before reaching the favored state, in which case demography effectively converts a quantitative into an absolute constraint. Here, we derive criteria for predicting when such conversions occur. We model the demography and evolution of populations subject to optimizing selection that experience either a single shift or a constant change in the optimum. In the single-shift case, we consider whether a population can evolve significantly without declining or else declines temporarily while avoiding low sizes consistent with high extinction risk. We analyze when populations in constantly changing environments evolve sufficiently to ensure long-term growth. From these, we derive formulas for critical levels of genetic variability that define demography-caused absolute constraints. The formulas depend on estimable properties of fitness, population size, or environmental change rates. Each extends to selection on multivariate traits.

There is a clear need to track these changes, and such information could make a major contribution to a global biodiversity observation system. Monitoring of biodiversity is an essential component of conservation because it allows problems to be identified, priorities to be set, solutions to be developed, and resources to be targeted (Balmford et al. 2003). Monitoring also allows assessments of progress toward targets and indicators in unilateral and international conservation-policy instruments (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity [CDB]), of the impacts of international conservation policy (Donald et al. 2007), and of other policy sectors (Donald et al. 2001). Nevertheless, a paucity of information has led to a poor understanding of the cost-effectiveness of conservation policies (Ferraro & Pattanayak 2006), exposing them to criticism (Stokstad 2005). The overwhelming majority of species and ecosystems receive no systematic monitoring, and there is a conspicuous mismatch between the distribution of monitoring effort and the distribution of terrestrial biodiversity at a global scale (Green et al. 2005).

We then used the species-area relationship to calculate the number of species predicted to become globally extinct following deforestation on these islands. Next, we counted the numbers of insular southeast Asian endemic bird species considered threatened-i.e., those having 'a high probability of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future'-in the latest summary Red Data Book. The numbers of extinctions predicted from deforestation and the numbers of species actually threatened are strikingly similar.

Understanding this link is critical for a wide-range of decision-making contexts. While there have been several attempts to come up with a classification scheme for ecosystem services, there has not been an agreed upon, meaningful and consistent definition for ecosystem services. In this paper we offer a definition of ecosystem services that is likely to be operational for ecosystem service research and several classification schemes. We argue that any attempt at classifying ecosystem services should be based on both the characteristics of the ecosystems of interest and a decision context for which the concept of ecosystem services is being mobilized. Because of this there is not one classification scheme that will be adequate for the many contexts in which ecosystem service research may be utilized. We discuss several examples of how classification schemes will be a function of both ecosystem and ecosystem service characteristics and the decision-making context. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes the development of integrated explorative and normative scenarios for the analysis of future land use in a climate-neutral Sweden. The aim is to show how backcasting scenarios fulfilling far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets can be related to assumptions on possible external developments, in order to contribute to the discussion on future sustainable land use. A target-fulfilling scenario element was combined with an external scenario element, i.e. developments that cannot be influenced by the targeted actors. The scenarios were developed and analysed in collaboration with local actors. Four scenarios were used to describe how land in Sweden could be used when Sweden has achieved zero emissions of greenhouse gases in 2060. The explorative dimension stretched from a situation where there is no international climate agreement to one where there is an international agreement on reducing greenhouse gases. The backcasting dimension illustrated different strategies to achieve the target and stretches from a very influential municipal level to one where the national/EU level is most influential. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:38:47","2022-10-11T14:38:47Z",NA,"59–71","","","60",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Climate change; Contextual scenario element; Land use; Normative scenario element; Participatory backcasting; Sweden","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This fishery is the country's second most valuable in monetary terms, and produces the highest annual yield in terms of landed mass (in recent years, a combined catch of the order of 400 000 t). It is the most dynamic of South Africa's main commercial fisheries, because the species targeted are relatively short-lived, often occur in mixed shoals, and experience large fluctuations in abundance. Mixed shoaling causes operational problems for the fishery, because of the inevitability of juvenile pilchard bycatch (of more value as adults for canning) in the anchovy-directed fishery. This operational interaction implies a trade-off between allowable catches for the two species, and hence necessitates that they are managed together. The development of a joint ""management procedure"" (sensu IWC) for the two species is described. This provides a framework for quantifying this trade-off, subject to the constraint that acceptable levels of risk of ""collapse"" are not exceeded for either resource. Important new features incorporated in a revision of the procedure implemented in 2002, which have made appreciably enhanced catches from the resources possible, are described.

It is unavoidable and even necessary to include the various value, knowledge and belief systems of decision makers or participants in decision processes. Consequently it is also important to reflect associated normative biases. An institutionalized, long-term, science-policy dialogue to arrive at a co-design of indicators to inform a multi-level ES governance approach could help here. Furthermore, social and environmental monitoring approaches need to be adapted towards delivering the requested indicator information. To account for the complexity of decision contexts one approach could be to bundle and aggregate indicator systems to social-ecological indices. Such indices could contribute also to services that are not visible and difficult to assess but are relevant for the well-being of future generations. An additional aspect is that such indices account better for aspect such as landscape composition and configuration, which are currently often ignored.

This approach, pioneered by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee, takes politically agreed management objectives and incorporates all scientific aspects of management including data collection and analysis, development of robust harvest control laws or effort regulations, and monitoring. A primary feature is that uncertainty (including that arising from sources conventionally ignored) is taken into account explicitly through population simulations for a variety of scenarios. The nature of the management procedures developed for commercial and aboriginal subsistence whaling and the processes by which they have been developed is highlighted. We also identify lessons that have been learned from two decades of IWC experience and suggest how these can be applied to other fishery situations. © 2007 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

LocationEurope. MethodWe modelled the response of European vegetation to changes in land use, climate and CO2 by combining the land-use model Dyna-CLUE (based on the CORINE land-cover data) and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Two reforestation options were explored: maintaining the current range of tree species (EFI) or promoting naturally occurring tree species (NAT). Climate data from two general circulation models and two SRES scenarios (A2 and B1) were used. The broad habitat types were classified according to a combination of land use and the dominant plant species. ResultsOur models predicted that croplands and grasslands are expected to decrease due to land-use change. Although climate change has a negative effect on needle-leaved forest, it is expected to maintain its area or even increase in the EFI reforestation option while mediterranean, broad-leaved and mixed forests are expected to increase markedly. All investigated drivers have shown some effect, but land use is the dominant contributor to broad habitat change except for needle-leaved and mixed which are mainly influenced by climate change. Main conclusionsLand use is predicted to have the greatest effect on broad habitat distribution according to our simulations. Hence in most parts of Europe mitigating actions should focus on land-use change rather than climate change. According to our simulation, the effects of the different drivers are not in general additive. In some cases they act synergistically and in some cases antagonistically.

These data sets will enable planners to systematically identify large-scale conservation priorities; however, they will cover only a tiny proportion of living organisms. Therefore, it is essential to investigate to what extent the areas selected for conservation actions can provide protection for other species. We analyzed the umbrella effect between amphibians and mammals across mainland Africa. We built habitat suitability models within the geographic ranges of 1654 species, based on data collected in the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment. We applied systematic reserve selection algorithms to two sets of estimators of the area of occupancy of amphibians and mammals (geographic ranges and estimated suitable areas) and thus selected four reserve systems. We then quantified the protection that each of the four systems provided for amphibians and mammals. Reserves selected for amphibians and mammals were comparable in area, with the former concentrated in the Afrotropical region and the latter more evenly dispersed. Mammal reserves left fewer gaps in species coverage among amphibians than the reverse, but amphibian reserves included a larger proportion of each mammal's area of occupancy than the reverse. For both taxa, setting reserves to include estimated suitable areas instead of ranges resulted in the clustering of reserves in the tropics. Furthermore, it efficiently protected hidden gaps (species with unsuitable portions of their range inside protected areas) in the other taxon and included a higher proportion of the area of occupancy of the other taxon. Overall, amphibians and mammals in Africa acted as an umbrella for a high proportion of species in the other taxon. Focusing on estimated suitable areas instead of ranges improved the umbrella effect of both taxa.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:38:46","2022-10-11T14:38:46Z",NA,"170–179","","1","20",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Complementarity; Conservation planning; Gap analysis; Habitat suitability model; Indicator species; Protected area; Reserve selection","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A population decline of \textgreater95%, starting in the 1990s, was first noted at Keoladeo National Park, India. Since then, catastrophic declines, also involving Gyps indicus and Gyps tenuirostris, have continued to be reported across the subcontinent. Consequently these vultures are now listed as critically endangered by BirdLife International. In 2000, the Peregrine Fund initiated its Asian Vulture Crisis Project with the Ornithological Society of Pakistan, establishing study sites at 16 OWBV colonies in the Kasur, Khanewal and Muzaffargarh-Layyah Districts of Pakistan to measure mortality at over 2,400 active nest sites. Between 2000 and 2003, high annual adult and subadult mortality (5-86%) and resulting population declines (34-95%) (ref. 5 and M.G., manuscript in preparation) were associated with renal failure and visceral gout. Here, we provide results that directly correlate residues of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac with renal failure.

In many cases the original (and inspirational) concepts are not directly applicable to our modern applications (e.g. set theory). There are some conceptual limitations found in individual definitions of niche (e.g. the fundamental niche concept), so it is perhaps understandable why more neutral terminology is becoming popular in SDM.

The internal structure of the extent of occurrence (EO) of a species is almost always unknown, even for ""well-known"" flagship species. We developed a methodology to infer the area of occupancy (AO) within the EO of a species using the limited available data. We present here the results of a three years project funded by European Union to develop high-resolution models of habitat suitability for 281 medium- to large-sized African mammals across the whole continent. The existing literature was reviewed and all data on the geographic distribution and environmental preferences of the selected species were collected. For each species, these data were then expressed in terms of key variables available as GIS layers at a resolution of 1 km2 over the entire African continent. The AO of each species was obtained merging the information on the ecological needs of the species and the values of ecological variables over the region identified as EO. The habitat suitability models were evaluated through direct field work in four countries (Morocco, Cameroon, Uganda, Botswana) chosen as representatives of the environmental and species diversity of Africa. More than 81% of models had positive true skill statistics (TSS) values, indicating models performing better than random. Rigorous modeling procedures supported by ad-hoc field evaluation allowed the production of high-resolution habitat suitability models useful for conservation applications. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:38:45","2022-10-11T14:38:45Z",NA,"605–621","","3","17",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"African mammals; Area of occupancy; Extent of occurrence; Habitat suitability models; Model validation","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although freshwater ecosystems include some of the most imperilled fauna world- wide, such range shifts have been poorly documented in streams and rivers and have never been compared to the current velocity of climate change. Based on national monitoring data, we examined the distributional changes of 32 stream fish species in France and quantified potential time lags in species responses, providing a unique opportunity to analyze range shifts over recent decades of warming in freshwater environments. A multi-facetted approach, based on several range measures along spatial gradients, allowed us to quantify range shifts of numerous species across the whole hydrographic network between an initial period (1980–1992) and a contemporary one (2003–2009), and to contrast them to the rates of isotherm shift in elevation and stream distance. Our results highlight systematic species shifts towards higher elevation and upstream, with mean shifts in range centre of 13.7 m decade21 and 0.6 km decade21, respectively. Fish species displayed dispersal-driven expansions along the altitudinal gradient at their upper range limit (61.5 m decade21), while substantial range contractions at the lower limit (6.3 km decade21) were documented for most species along the upstream–downstream gradient. Despite being consistent with the geographic variation in climate change velocities, these patterns reveal that the majority of stream fish have not shifted at a pace sufficient to track changing climate, in particular at their range centre where range shifts lag far behind expectation.

Using a length-based multi-species model, we investigate the effects of selective versus nonselective fishing on fish communities. Both size and species selectivity are examined, and fishing effects on biodiversity are measured with three indices: (i) evenness, (ii) the number of collapsed species, and (iii) an index of size diversity. The model is parameterized for the Georges Bank and North Sea fish communities. The results suggest that there is no ""optimal"" size selectivity to maintain biodiversity: the effects of each exploitation pattern depend on the selectivity of the gear (i. e., the shape of the selection curve) relative to the available sizes. Catching a narrow range of species almost always reduced evenness and species richness more than taking the same catch from a broader range of species. In summary, neither selective nor nonselective fishing can be said to be generally preferable for conserving biodiversity; the outcome depends on the particular species composition and size structure of the community.

An efficient yet challenging goal to achieve such population estimates consists of recording empirical species' presence and absence at a specific regional scale and then trying to predict occupancies at finer scales. So far the majority of the methods have been based on particular species' distributional features deemed to be crucial for downscaling occupancy. However, only a minority of them have dealt explicitly with specific spatial features. Here we employ a wide class of spatial point processes, the shot noise Cox processes (SNCP), to model species occupancies at different spatial scales and show that species' spatial aggregation is crucial for predicting population estimates at fine scales starting from coarser ones. These models are formulated in continuous space and locate points regardless of the arbitrary resolution that one employs to study the spatial pattern. We compare the performances of nine models, calibrated at regional scales and demonstrate that a very simple class of SNCP, the Thomas process, is able to outperform other published models in predicting occupancies down to areas four orders of magnitude smaller than the ones employed for the parameterization. We conclude by explaining the ability of the approach to infer spatially explicit information from spatially implicit measures, the potential of the framework to combine niche and spatial models, and the possibility of reversing the method to allow upscaling.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:44","2022-10-11T14:38:44Z",NA,"1004–1014","","3","22",NA,NA,"Downscaling species occupancy from coarse spatial",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Downscaling; Neyman-Scott process; Occupancy-area curve; Poisson cluster process; Shot noise Cox processes; Spatial point processes; Species aggregation; Species occupancy; Thomas process","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present the results for the circulation and hydrography of the Barents Sea from the ocean component of two global models and from a corresponding pair of regional model configurations.

This investigation was undertaken in order to shed light on two questions that are essential in the context of regional ocean projections: (1) How should a regional model be set up in order to take advantage of the results from global projections ; (2) What limits to quality in the results of regional models are imposed by the quality of global models? We approached the first question by initializing the ocean model in the control simulation by a realistic ocean analysis and specifying air-sea fluxes according to the results from the A. Melsom Norwegian Meteorological Institute, Oslo, Norway global models. For the projection simulation, the global models' oceanic anomalies from their control simulation results were added upon initialization. Regarding the second question, the present set of simulations includes regional downscalings of the present-day climate as well as projected climate change. Thus, we study separately how downscal-ing changes the results in the control climate case, and how scenario results are changed. For the present-day climate, we find that downscaling reduces the differences in the Bar-ents Sea between the original global models. Furthermore, the downscaled results are closer to observations. On the other hand, the downscaled results from the scenario simulations are significantly different: while the heat transport into the Barents Sea and the salinity distribution change modestly from control to scenario with ROMS-G, in ROMS-N the heat transport is much larger in the scenario simulation , and the water masses become much less saline. The lack of robustness in the results from the scenario simulations leads us to conclude that the results for the regional oceanic response to changes in the radiative forcing depend on the choice of AOGCM and is not settled. Consequently, the effect of climate change on the marine ecosystem of the Barents Sea is anything but certain.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:38:44","2022-10-11T14:38:44Z",NA,"927–949","","7","64",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Barents Sea; Downscaling; Future climate; ROMS","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we use a dynamic model framework to demonstrate that recently-observed changes at the expanding northern boundaries of three British butterfly species can be predicted with good accuracy. Previous work established that the distributions of the study species currently lag behind climate change, and so we presumed that climate is not currently a major constraint at the northern range margins of our study species. We predicted 1970-2000 distribution changes using a colonisation model, MIGRATE, superimposed on a high-resolution map of habitat availability. Thirty-year rates and patterns of distribution change could be accurately predicted for each species (kappa goodness-of-fit of models \textgreater 0.64 for all three species, corresponding to \textgreater 83% of grid cells correctly assigned), using a combination of individual species traits, species-specific habitat associations and distance-dependent dispersal. Sensitivity analyses showed that population productivity was the most important determinant of the rate of distribution expansion (variation in dispersal rate was not studied because the species are thought to be similar in dispersal capacity), and that each species' distribution prior to expansion was critical in determining the spatial pattern of the current distribution.

Shifting of distribution range may affect global marine fisheries and have large socio-economic implications. However, global- scale evaluation of the impact of climate change on marine species is lacking. In this paper, we develop a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict the effect of climate change on the distributions of marine species with emphasis on commercially exploited fishes and invertebrates. First, the model infers, for various species, bioclimate envelopes based on their current distribution. Bioclimate envelopes are defined by sea water temperature, bathymetry, habitats and distance from sea ice. Secondly, the model predicts the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes induced by changes in climate variables. Simultaneously, following the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes, the model simulates movement of relative abundance through changes in population growth, mortality, larval dispersal and adult movement. We test the model with several commercially exploited fish species with widely different biogeography. The model provides reasonable and robust predictions of future distribution ranges of the four species under different scenarios of sea water warming. Moreover, the predictions are robust to major model assumptions and parameter uncertainty. Using realistic climate change predictions from the NOAA/GFDL Coupled Model, this model will be used to evaluate impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries.",2008,"2022-10-11 14:38:43","2022-10-11T14:38:43Z",NA,"5–50","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"Fisheries Centre, University of British Columbia","Vancouver","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is natural to ask what it adds to the existing large body of individual-based ecological theory. We approach this question pragmatically–through detailed study of the individual physiology and population dynamics of the zooplankter Daphnia and its algal food. Standard DEB theory uses several state variables to characterize the state of an individual organism, thereby making the transition to population dynamics technically challenging, while ecologists demand maximally simple models that can be used in multi-scale modelling. We demonstrate that simpler representations of individual bioenergetics with a single state variable (size), and two life stages (juveniles and adults), contain sufficient detail on mass and energy budgets to yield good fits to data on growth, maturation and reproduction of individual Daphnia in response to food availability. The same simple representations of bioenergetics describe some features of Daphnia mortality, including enhanced mortality at low food that is not explicitly incorporated in the standard DEB model. Size-structured, population models incorporating this additional mortality component resolve some long-standing questions on stability and population cycles in Daphnia. We conclude that a bioenergetic model serving solely as a 'regression' connecting organismal performance to the history of its environment can rest on simpler representations than those of standard DEB. But there are associated costs with such pragmatism, notably loss of connection to theory describing interspecific variation in physiological rates. The latter is an important issue, as the type of detailed study reported here can only be performed for a handful of species.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:38:43","2022-10-11T14:38:43Z",NA,"","3541–3552","","365",NA,NA,"",NA,"1557",NA,NA,"Cambridge University Press","Cambridge, U.K.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2010.0167 PMID: 20921052",NA,NA,NA,"Daphnia; Dynamic energy budget; Population cycles; Population dynamics; Stability","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the only known obligate scavengers, vultures are uniquely adapted to a scavenging lifestyle. Vultures' unique adaptations include soaring flight, keen eyesight, and extremely low pH levels in their stomachs. Presently, 14 of 23 (61%) vulture species worldwide are threatened with extinction, and the most rapid declines have occurred in the vulture-rich regions of Asia and Africa. The reasons for the population declines are varied, but poisoning or human persecution, or both, feature in the list of nearly every declining species. Deliberate poisoning of carnivores is likely the most widespread cause of vulture poisoning. In Asia, Gyps vultures have declined by \textgreater95% due to poisoning by the veterinary drug diclofenac, which was banned by regional governments in 2006. Human persecution of vultures has occurred for centuries, and shooting and deliberate poisoning are the most widely practiced activities. Ecological consequences of vulture declines include changes in community composition of scavengers at carcasses and an increased potential for disease transmission between mammalian scavengers at carcasses. There have been cultural and economic costs of vulture declines as well, particularly in Asia. In the wake of catastrophic vulture declines in Asia, regional governments, the international scientific and donor communities, and the media have given the crisis substantial attention. Even though the Asian vulture crisis focused attention on the plight of vultures worldwide, the situation for African vultures has received relatively little attention especially given the similar levels of population decline. While the Asian crisis has been largely linked to poisoning by diclofenac, vulture population declines in Africa have numerous causes, which have made conserving existing populations more difficult. And in Africa there has been little government support to conserve vultures despite mounting evidence of the major threats. In other regions with successful vulture conservation programs, a common theme is a huge investment of financial resources and highly skilled personnel, as well as political will and community support.

We derived information on distribution state and human pressure from satellite-borne imagery. Variables in all four classes were identified as important predictors of extinction risk, and interactions were observed among variables in different classes (e.g. level of protection, human threats, species distribution ranges). Species biology had a key role in mediating the effect of external variables. The model was 90% accurate in classifying extinction risk status of species, but in a few cases the observed and modelled extinction risk mismatched. Species in this condition might suffer from an incorrect classification of extinction risk (hence require reassessment).

Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is one of the world's most invasive aquatic plants and is known to cause significant ecological and socio-economic effects. 2. Water hyacinth can alter water clarity and decrease phytoplankton production, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, heavy metals and concentrations of other contaminants. 3. The effects of water hyacinth on ecological communities appear to be largely nonlinear. Abundance and diversity of aquatic invertebrates generally increase in response to increased habitat heterogeneity and structural complexity provided by water hyacinth but decrease due to decreased phytoplankton (food) availability. 4. Effects of water hyacinth on fish are largely dependent on original community composition and food-web structure. A more diverse and abundant epiphytic invertebrate community may increase fish abundance and diversity, but a decrease in phytoplankton may decrease dissolved oxygen concentrations and planktivorous fish abundance, subsequently affecting higher trophic levels. 5. Little is known about the effects of water hyacinth on waterbird communities; however, increases in macroinvertebrate and fish abundance and diversity suggest a potentially positive interaction with waterbirds when water hyacinth is at moderate density. 6. The socio-economic effects of water hyacinth are dependent on the extent of the invasion, the uses of the impacted waterbody, control methods and the response to control efforts. Ecosystem-level research programmes that simultaneously monitor the effects of water hyacinth on multiple trophic-levels are needed to further our understanding of invasive species.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:38:42","2022-10-11T14:38:42Z",NA,"282–298","","2","55",NA,NA,"Ecological and socio-economic impacts of invasive",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Aquatic plant; Eichhornia crassipes; Freshwater; Invasive species; Water hyacinth","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although dispersal can depend on many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, in recent years many studies have shown that it scales with body size and home range area. However, the role of further ecological correlates to distance travelled is still unclear and the predictive models proposed so far have suffered from small sample size and lack of error estimates. This reduces the practical relevance of the models for ecological and conservation applications. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis on 327 studies on the dispersal of 164 mammal species, and performed linear and non-linear regression analyses to explore the relationships of body size and home range area with dispersal distance. We tested the effect of various life history traits and ecological factors on the relationships and performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the models to sample size. The linear relationships of both home range and body size with dispersal distance were influenced by various life history traits and ecological factors. We developed allometric functions to estimate species dispersal distance based on different predictors and life history traits. Linear models representing the relationship between dispersal distance and body size or home range area received good support; however logistic models better approximates both relationships. Despite receiving less support than a logistic curve, a linear model between dispersal and home range is a good approximation for applicative purposes. Sensitivity analysis showed that our results are robust to subsampling of the original dataset until a sample of 40 species. Our empirical models have the potential to improve theoretical and applied population biology studies by extending the applicability and improving the accuracy of dispersal distance estimation to a large number of mammals.

Conservation and protection of these species is important as they represent sources of novel therapeutic phytochemical compounds and are culturally valuable. Information on the spatial distribution and use of customary medicinal plants is often inadequate and fragmented, posing limitations on the identification and conservation of species-rich areas and culturally valuable habitats.In this study, the habitat suitability modeling program, MaxEnt, was used to predict the potential ecological niches of 431 customary medicinal plant species, based on bioclimatic variables. Specimen locality records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data portal and from Australia's Virtual Herbarium (AVH).Ecological niche models of 414 predicted species, which had 30 or more occurrence points, were used to produce maps indicating areas that were ecologically suitable for multiple species (concordance of high predicted ecological suitability) and having cultural values. For the concordance map, individual species niche models were thresholded and summed. To derive a map of culturally valuable areas, customary medicinal uses from Customary Medicinal Knowledgebase (CMKb) (www.biolinfo.org/cmkb) were used to weight individual species models, resulting in a value within each grid cell reflecting its cultural worth.Even though the available information is scarce and fragmented, our approach provides an opportunity to infer areas predicted to be suitable for multiple species (i.e. concordance hotspots) and to estimate the cultural value of a particular geographical area. Our results also indicate that to conserve bio-cultural diversity, comprehensive information and active participation of Aboriginal communities is indispensable. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:38:41","2022-10-11T14:38:41Z",NA,"3437–3443","","18","222",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Australian Aborigines; Conservation areas; Cultural value; Customary medicinal plants; Ecological niche modeling; Species richness","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This conservation tool, which comprises core areas, corridors, and buffer areas, has attracted the attention of several national and European institutions. It is thought that ENs can connect habitat patches and thus enable species to move across unsuitable areas. In Europe, however, ENs are proposed as an oversimplification of complex ecological concepts, and we maintain that they are of limited use for biodiversity conservation for several reasons. The ENs are species specific and operate on species-dependent scales. In addition, the information needed for their implementation is only available for a handful of species. To overcome these limitations, ENs have been proposed on a landscape scale (and for selected ""focal"" species), but there is no indication that the structural composition of core areas, corridors, and buffer areas could ensure the functional connectivity and improve the viability of more than a few species. The theory behind ENs fails to provide sufficient practical information on how to build them (e.g., width, shape, structure, content). In fact, no EN so far has been validated in practice (ensuring connectivity and increasing overall biodiversity conservation), and there are no signs that validation will be possible in the near future. In view of these limitations, it is difficult to justify spending economic and political resources on building systems that are at best working hypotheses that cannot be evaluated on a practical level.",2007,"2022-10-11 14:38:41","2022-10-11T14:38:41Z",NA,"1414–1422","","6","21",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Connectivity; Core areas; Corridors; Ecological networks; Focal species","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.",2009,"2022-10-11 14:38:41","2022-10-11T14:38:41Z",NA,"253–269","","1","78",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecological stoichiometry; Foraging theory; Host-parasitoid interactions; Metabolic theory of ecology; Mutualistic networks","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report(1) cites 28,586 studies demonstrating significant biological changes in terrestrial systems(2). Already high extinction rates, driven primarily by habitat loss, are predicted to increase under climate change(3-6). Yet there is little specific advice or precedent in the literature to guide climate adaptation investment for conserving biodiversity within realistic economic constraints(7). Here we present a systematic ecological and economic analysis of a climate adaptation problem in one of the world's most species-rich and threatened ecosystems: the South African fynbos. We discover a counterintuitive optimal investment strategy that switches twice between options as the available adaptation budget increases. We demonstrate that optimal investment is nonlinearly dependent on available resources, making the choice of how much to invest as important as determining where to invest and what actions to take. Our study emphasizes the importance of a sound analytical framework for prioritizing adaptation investments(4). Integrating ecological predictions in an economic decision framework will help support complex choices between adaptation options under severe uncertainty. Our prioritization method can be applied at any scale to minimize species loss and to evaluate the robustness of decisions to uncertainty about key assumptions.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:38:40","2022-10-11T14:38:40Z",NA,"355–359","","7","1",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such predictions are highly uncertain given: (i) differences in site quality, management regimes and planting geometries (belt versus block configurations) result in rates of sequestration that are highly variable at regional scales and (ii) uncertainties in carbon accounting methods in future carbon markets. Here we examined the economics of three case studies (two of farm forestry and one of biodiverse environmental plantings) to address these issues. There was significant variation in economic viability both between and within case studies (average coefficient of variation of 39%) as a result of differences in site quality, management regime and planting geometries. We conclude that if carbon offset investment targets marginal land (i.e. areas of farms of lowest productivity), carbon prices required for economic viability are \textless$18t CO 2-e, even at a relatively high discount rate of 8%. Although regional employment generated per hectare tends to be less than many existing agricultural enterprises, any jobs generated from use of this low productivity land for carbon forestry would be additional. Economic viability was generally greatest for 3-4 row belt farm forestry plantings because of increased growth, particularly in areas of relatively high rainfall. Supplementary payments may therefore be needed to make biodiverse environmental plantings competitive in areas of lower rainfall and thus less profitability. © 2012.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:40","2022-10-11T14:38:40Z",NA,"496–506","","1","30",NA,NA,"Economic and employment implications of a carbon m",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"3PG; Biodiversity; CABALA; Carbon farming; FullCAM; Sequestration","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple ecosystem services across landscapes and present an empirical demonstration of ecosystem service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly. Ecosystem service bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial patterns of 12 ecosystem services in a mixed-use landscape consisting of 137 municipalities in Quebec, Canada. We identified six types of ecosystem service bundles and were able to link these bundles to areas on the landscape characterized by distinct social-ecological dynamics. Our results show landscape-scale tradeoffs between provisioning and almost all regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and they show that a greater diversity of ecosystem services is positively correlated with the provision of regulating ecosystem services.

The advent of an ecosystem-based approach dramatically expanded the scope of fisheries management, creating a critical need for new kinds of data and quantitative approaches that could be integrated into the management system. Ecosystem models are needed to codify the relationships among drivers, pressures and resulting states, and to quantify the trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Incorporating ecosystem considerations requires moving from the single-species models used in stock assessments, to more complex models that include species interactions, environmental drivers and human consequences. With this increasing model complexity, model fit can improve, but parameter uncertainty increases. At intermediate levels of complexity, there is a ‘sweet spot' at which the uncertainty in policy indicators is at a minimum. Finding the sweet spot in models requires compromises: for example, to include additional component species, the models of each species have in some cases been simplified from age-structured to logistic or bioenergetic models. In this paper, we illuminate the characteristics, capabilities and short-comings of the various modelling approaches being proposed for ecosystem-based fisheries management. We identify key ecosystem needs in fisheries management and indicate which types of models can meet these needs. Ecosystem models have been playing strategic roles by providing an ecosystem context for single-species management decisions. However, conventional stock assessments are being increasingly challenged by changing natural mortality rates and environmentally driven changes in productivity that are observed in many fish stocks. Thus, there is a need for more tactical ecosystem models that can respond dynamically to changing ecological and environmental conditions.",2016,"2022-10-11 14:38:39","2022-10-11T14:38:39Z",NA,"101–125","","1","17",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem-based management; Fisheries; Marine; Model complexity; Trade-off","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The outcomes of these simulations can then be used to modify the initial parametrization, and the simulations are rerun until external validation is achieved. This reconceptualization of the Ecopath approach as an iterative process, which helps address issues of structural uncertainty, does not increase its input requirements markedly. Rather, it has become possible, through a Bayesian resampling routine, to explicitly consider the numerical uncertainty associated with these inputs. We present the key features of the reconceptualized approach, and two indices based thereon for quantifying the ecosystem impacts of fisheries. We conclude with a brief discussion of its limitations, both present and intrinsic.

This paper revisits the controversy on economic valuation of ecosystem services in the light of two aspects that are often neglected in ongoing debates. First, the role of the particular institutional setup in which environmental policy and governance is currently embedded in shaping valuation outcomes. Second, the broader economic and sociopolitical processes that have governed the expansion of pricing into previously non-marketed areas of the environment. Our analysis suggests that within the institutional setup and broader sociopolitical processes that have become prominent since the late 1980s economic valuation is likely to pave the way for the commodification of ecosystem services with potentially counterproductive effects in the long term for biodiversity conservation and equity of access to ecosystem services benefits.

This calls for the reassessment and transformation of conceptual-theoretical, natural resource management, and governance approaches to conservation. In the past, conservation efforts focused on distinct components of ecosystems without regard for long-term human well-being. Natural resource management in turn sought to control nature to harvest products for direct consumption or for sale at markets. However, this singular focus on management ignored that ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems with nonlinear feedback and thresholds (Costanza 2008) and are tightly interlinked with human systems (Menzel and Teng 2010). Since the 1970s (Holling 1973, 1978), awareness has increased about the negative and unexpected social and environmental problems caused by attempts to control highly complex and nonlinear natural systems (Holling and Meffe 1996). Conventional command-and-control resource management has also become increasingly criticized (e.g., Holling and Meffe 1996, Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000, Folke et al. 2005), and new innovative approaches have emerged for understanding and managing social-ecological systems. For example, the ecosystem services approach currently informs the development of environmental accounting and performance systems (Boyd and Banzhaf 2007), economic valuation for environmental decision making, planning and policy (Balmford et al. 2002, Turner et al. 2003), equity in human welfare (see Wallace 2007), landscape management, adaptive governance (Folke et al. 2005), and attainment of multiple conservation objectives (Fisher et al. 2009).",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:38","2022-10-11T14:38:38Z",NA,"","","4","18",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As ESS refer to human needs and interests, values are to be considered when dealing with the concept in practice. As a result we argue that in using the concept there is a need to be clear about what different dimensions of value are involved, and be aware of ethical issues that might be associated with the concept. A systematic analysis of the ethical implications associated to the ESS concept is still lacking. We address this deficiency by scrutinising value dimensions associated with the concept, and use this to explore the associated ethical implications. We then highlight how improved transparency in the use of the ESS concept can contribute to using its strengths without succumbing to possible drawbacks arising from ethical problems. These problems concern the dangers that some uses of the concept have in obscuring certain types of value, and in masking unevenness in the distribution of costs and benefits that can arise in the management of ESS. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:38","2022-10-11T14:38:38Z",NA,"260–268","","","93",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Environmental policies; Ethics; Nature conservation; Values","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Context: Future patterns of European ecosystem services provision are likely to vary significantly as a result of climatic and socio-economic change and the implementation of adaptation strategies. However, there is little research in mapping future ecosystem services and no integrated assessment approach to map the combined impacts of these drivers. Objective: Map changing patterns in ecosystem services for different European futures and (a) identify the role of driving forces; (b) explore the potential influence of different adaptation options. Methods: The CLIMSAVE integrated assessment platform is used to map spatial patterns in services (food, water and timber provision, atmospheric regulation, biodiversity existence/bequest, landscape experience and land use diversity) for a number of combined climatic and socio-economic scenarios. Eight adaptation strategies are explored within each scenario. Results: Future service provision (particularly water provision) will be significantly impacted by climate change. Socio-economic changes shift patterns of service provision: more dystopian societies focus on food provision at the expense of other services. Adaptation options offer significant opportunities, but may necessitate trade-offs between services, particularly between agriculture- and forestry-related services. Unavoidable trade-offs between regions (particularly South–North) are also identified in some scenarios. Conclusions: Coordinating adaptation across regions and sectors will be essential to ensure that all needs are met: a factor that will become increasingly pressing under dystopian futures where inter-regional cooperation breaks down. Integrated assessment enables exploration of interactions and trade-offs between ecosystem services, highlighting the importance of taking account of complex cross-sectoral interactions under different future scenarios of planning adaptation responses.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:38:38","2022-10-11T14:38:38Z",NA,"443–461","","3","30",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PMID: 26120250",NA,NA,NA,"Adaptation; Climate change impacts; Cross-sectoral interactions; Ecosystem services; Integrated assessment; Trade-offs","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L).

We report here on a study to examine the impact of trees on water flow (infiltration) in an agricultural landscape with substantial areas of extant native vegetation. We examined infiltration through coarse- and fine-textured soils within four landscape strata, the zones below Eucalyptus melliodora and Callitris glaucophylla canopies, the intertree zone dominated by perennial grasses and a landscape homogenized by cultivation and dominated by annual crops. We measured sorptivity, the early phase of water flow, and steady-state infiltration with disc permeameters at two supply potentials. These different potentials enabled us to separate infiltration into (i) flow through large (biopores) and small pores and (ii) flow through small pores only where biopores are prevented from conducting water. On the fine-textured soils, both sorptivity and steady-state infiltration were significantly greater (approximately fivefold) under the timbered strata compared with the grassy slopes or cultivation. Differences were attributable to the greater proportion of macropores below the tree canopies compared with the nontimbered strata. The lack of a significant difference on the coarse-textured soils, despite their macropore status, was attributed to differences in surface litter and plant cover, which would maintain continuous macropores at the surface and thus conduct large amounts of water. The tendency of slopes covered by cryptogamic crusts and grasses to shed run-off and for the trees to absorb substantial quantities of water reinforced the important ecological service provided by trees, which moderates large run-off events and captures small amounts of water leaking from the grassy patches. In the absence of these 'ecosystem wicks', run-off would find its way into regional groundwater and contribute to rising salinity.",2005,"2022-10-11 14:38:37","2022-10-11T14:38:37Z",NA,"336–347","","3","30",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Carbon; Ecosystem engineering; Eucalypt; Infiltration; Isolated tree; Macroporosity; Semiarid woodland","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It focuses on Indigenous people in Australia and examines the available well-being frameworks from global as well as from local (i.e. Australian and Indigenous), perspectives. It applies a holistic approach to assess the role of natural systems in indigenous well-being demonstrating how people's social, economic and cultural worlds, and how people's capabilities relate to their natural systems. It integrates various social, economic and ecological values through the application of Capability Approach and the Millennium Assessment Approach. The study proposes an integrated framework that focuses on people's belongingness to nature i.e. people's values and capabilities that link to well-being. It emphasises the importance of each connection that people may have with their country in terms of people's capabilities. The proposed framework can contribute to improved and better-informed policies on indigenous well-being as well as on the use, value and management of natural systems.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:38:36","2022-10-11T14:38:36Z",NA,"197–206","","","4",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Ecosystem services; Ecosystems; Indigenous; Millennium Assessment; Socio-economic-ecological framework; Well-being","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:36","2022-10-11T14:38:36Z",NA,"41–4645–41–4645","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"Millennium Ecosystem Assessment","Washington, DC","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.5860/choice.41-4645",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The simulations demonstrate that the river nutrients have a significant contribution on the annual primary production, both in the southern North Sea, in Skagerrak and along the Norwegian west coast. A 50% reduction in the loads of N and P reduces the primary production with 10-30% in the southern North Sea, and 5-10% in Skagerrak and along the Norwegian west coast. Scandinavian rivers only contribute to the 1-2% level in these reductions, thus, continental rivers have the major effect on the environment in all downstream areas. However, it should be noted that this reduction, even in the southern North Sea, is less than the natural variability of the production of phytoplankton. A reduction only in the P values shows that the production regime in the southern North Sea is phosphorous limited, while nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in the northern North Sea. Focusing on the N/P ratio as a possible proxy for eutrophication, a reduction in the N and P loads reduces this ratio by a similar factor, while a reduction in the P loads only, increases it. Based on this, it is proposed to use the N/P ratio for eutrophication assessment, and this is demonstrated. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed impacts from water consumption on the species richness of waterbirds, nonresidential birds, water-dependent mammals, reptiles and amphibians in wetlands, considering a larger number of taxa than previous life cycle impact assessment methods. Effect factors (EF) were derived for 1184 wetlands of international importance. EFs quantify the number of global species-equivalents lost per m2 of wetland area loss. Vulnerability and range size of species were included to reflect conservation values. Further, we derived spatially explicit characterization factors (CFs) that distinguish between surface water and groundwater consumption. All relevant watershed areas that are contributing to feeding the respective wetlands were determined for CF applications. In an example of rose production, we compared damages of water consumption in Kenya and The Netherlands. In both cases, the impact was largest for waterbirds. The total impact from water consumption in Kenya was 67 times larger than in The Netherlands, due to larger species richness and species' vulnerability in Kenya, as well as more arid conditions and larger amounts of water consumed. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:35","2022-10-11T14:38:35Z",NA,"12248–12257","","21","47",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Plant interactions play a central role in regulating plant communities and this role can be altered by abiotic stress. With increasing stress, ecological theory predicts that the role of competition decreases whilst that of facilitation increases. Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. 2. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plantplant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plantplant interactions. 3. Our analyses revealed that competition measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. 4.Synthesis. Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plantplant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plantplant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plantplant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:38:35","2022-10-11T14:38:35Z",NA,"300–312","","1","99",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Competition importance and intensity; Environmental gradients; Plant-plant interactions; Stress gradient hypothesis; Tree radial growth","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Effectively conserving biodiversity in these systems requires accurate downscaling of climatic trends to local habitat conditions, but downscaling is difficult in complex terrains given diverse microclimates and mediation of stream heat budgets by local conditions. We compiled a stream temperature database (n ¼ 780) for a 2500-km river network in central Idaho to assess possible trends in summer temperatures and thermal habitat for two native salmonid species from 1993 to 2006. New spatial statistical models that account for network topology were parameterized with these data and explained 93% and 86% of the variation in mean stream temperatures and maximas, respectively. During our study period, basin average mean stream temperatures increased by 0.388C (0.278C/decade), and maximas increased by 0.488C (0.348C/ decade), primarily due to long-term (30–50 year) trends in air temperatures and stream flows. Radiation increases from wildfires accounted for 9% of basin-scale temperature increases, despite burning 14% of the basin. Within wildfire perimeters, however, stream temperature increases were 2–3 times greater than basin averages, and radiation gains accounted for 50% of warming. Thermal habitat for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was minimally affected by temperature increases, except for small shifts towards higher elevations. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in contrast, were estimated to have lost 11–20% (8–16%/decade) of the headwater stream lengths that were cold enough for spawning and early juvenile rearing, with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats. Our results suggest that a warming climate has begun to affect thermal conditions in streams and that impacts to biota will be specific to both species and context. Where species are at risk, conservation actions should be guided based on considerations of restoration opportunity and future climatic effects. To refine predictions based on thermal effects, more work is needed to understand mechanisms associated with biological responses, climate effects on other habitat features, and habitat configurations that confer population resilience.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:38:35","2022-10-11T14:38:35Z",NA,"1350–1371","","5","20",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Boise river basin; Bull trout; Climate change; Global warming; Idaho; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Patch; Rainbow trout; Salvelinus confluentus; Spatial statistical model; Stream temperature; Thermal habitat; USA; Wildfire","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, these data sets always come with errors in the maps and associated metadata. Errors are often overlooked in conservation studies, despite their potential negative effects on the reported extent of protection of species and ecosystems. We used 3 case studies to illustrate the implications of 3 sources of errors in reporting progress toward conservation objectives: protected areas with unknown boundaries that are replaced by buffered centroids, propagation of multiple errors in spatial data, and incomplete protected-area data sets. As of 2010, the frequency of protected areas with unknown boundaries in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) caused the estimated extent of protection of 37.1% of the terrestrial Neotropical mammals to be overestimated by an average 402.8% and of 62.6% of species to be underestimated by an average 10.9%. Estimated level of protection of the world's coral reefs was 25% higher when using recent finer-resolution data on coral reefs as opposed to globally available coarse-resolution data. Accounting for additional data sets not yet incorporated into WDPA contributed up to 6.7% of additional protection to marine ecosystems in the Philippines. We suggest ways for data providers to reduce the errors in spatial and ancillary data and ways for data users to mitigate the effects of these errors on biodiversity assessments.",2013,"2022-10-11 14:38:35","2022-10-11T14:38:35Z",NA,"1000–1010","","5","27",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","English, Spanish",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Gap analysis; Priority setting; Protected area; Spatial analyses; Spatial error; WDPA","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The OpenMI modelling interface is used to couple a comprehensive hydrological modelling system, MIKE SHE running on personal computers, and a regional climate modelling system, HIRHAM running on a high performance computing platform. The coupled model enables two-way interaction between the atmosphere and the groundwater via the land surface and can represent the lateral movement of water in both the surface and subsurface and their interactions, not normally accounted for in climate models. Meso-scale processes are important for climate in general and rainfall in particular. Hydrological impacts are assessed at the catchment scale, the most important scale for water management. Feedback between groundwater, the land surface and the atmosphere occurs across a range of scales. Recognising this, the coupling was developed to allow dynamic exchange of water and energy at the catchment scale embedded within a larger meso-scale modelling domain. We present the coupling methodology used and describe the challenges in representing the exchanges between models and across scales. The coupled model is applied to one-way and two-way coupled simulations for a managed groundwater-dominated catchment, the Skjern River, Denmark. These coupled model simulations are evaluated against field observations and then compared with uncoupled climate and hydrological model simulations. Exploratory simulations show significant differences, particularly in the summer for precipitation and evapotranspiration the coupled model including groundwater and the RCM where groundwater is neglected. However, the resulting differences in the net precipitation and the catchment runoff in this groundwater dominated catchment were small.

However, the black-footed ferret Mustela nigripes exemplifies a class of endangered species for which strong species interactions cannot be ignored. This species is an obligate predator of prairie dogs Cynomys spp., and sylvatic plague Yersinia pestis epizootics threaten to undermine recovery efforts by functionally eliminating the prey base. Multispecies 'metamodelling' techniques offer new opportunities for exploring population dynamics under strong species interdependencies and disease. To investigate ferret extinction risk in plague-affected landscapes, we simultaneously modelled plague epidemiological processes, prairie dog metapopulation dynamics and ferret demographic responses. Ferret population dynamics were investigated at an important release site (Conata Basin in South Dakota) and for 500 artificial prey landscapes spanning a wide range of realistic colony configurations (e.g. total area, # colonies, spatial clustering) and demographic characteristics. Our simulation models indicate that ferrets are unlikely to persist through episodes of plague at Conata Basin unless they can access prey resources from a wider region or unless management actions can otherwise substantially reduce plague transmission. We show that large, diffuse prairie dog metapopulations (those with colonies spread over a region \textgreater2500 km2) are most likely to support ferret populations in plague-affected landscapes. Our results also highlight the potential importance of metapopulation connectivity in fuelling plague epizootics and thereby imperilling black-footed ferret conservation efforts. We describe a cycle (c. 5- to 25-year period) of plague-driven population crashes that is an emergent property of our models, and which can destabilize ferret populations. Synthesis and applications. On the basis of our models, we conclude that few North American prairie dog complexes cover sufficient land area to sustain black-footed ferret populations through plague-driven crashes in prey abundance. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of working with many constituents to conserve large prairie dog landscapes in addition to continued development of plague mitigation tools. In addition, the strong relationship between plague-induced oscillatory prey cycles and predator population persistence highlights the potential conservation benefits of imposing strategic barriers to connectivity in areas over which plague outbreak cycles are strongly synchronous. © 2014 British Ecological Society.",2014,"2022-10-11 14:38:34","2022-10-11T14:38:34Z",NA,"735–745","","3","51",NA,NA,"Effects of prey metapopulation structure on the vi",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Connectivity; Disease spread; Oscillatory population dynamics; Predator-prey interactions; Sensitivity analysis; Spatial structure","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research addresses the impact of varroa mites on survivorship, viral incidence, and physiological traits of newly-emerged worker bees. RT-PCR confirmed our previous finding that varroa parasitization was linked to high levels of deformed wing virus (DWV). In non-treatment bees, varroa parasitization combined with increased viral levels altered survivorship curves from long-survival to shorter-survival types. After challenge with live Escherichia coli, the survivorship of mite-parasitized bees was significantly lower than mite-free bees. Deformed-wing, mite-parasitized bees died on average within 1 day, even without E. coli challenge. This was correlated with the absence of an important enzyme activity in insect immunity, phenol oxidase, lacking even in those bees challenged with immuno-elicitors. The lack of inducible phenol oxidase activity indicated that the bee immune system is not fully competent upon adult emergence. Varroa parasitism also significantly reduced body weight of the parasitized bees, but body weight was not significantly correlated with the survivorship of mite-parasitized bees. Our research indicates that the combination of mite parasitization, the interaction of DWV and microbes, and a developmental immune incompetency attribute to decreased worker survivorship and have a negative impact on colony fitness.",2007,"2022-10-11 14:38:34","2022-10-11T14:38:34Z",NA,"405–412","","3","134",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Apis mellifera; Deformed wing virus; Immunity; Phenol oxidase; Survivorship; Varroa destructor","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These properties emerged from our encoding of the biology of, and interactions among, individual organisms without any direct constraints on the properties themselves.

If this is carried out informally then inferior strategies may be selected, while those formal evaluation procedures that have been suggested in relation to scenario planning are unlikely to be practical in most contexts.

However, it is difficult to predict easily the novel selection pressures to which populations will be exposed. There is heavy reliance on plant genetic diversity for future crop security in agriculture and industry, but the implications of genetic diversity for natural populations receives less attention. Here, we examine the links between the genetic diversity of natural populations and aspects of plant performance and fitness. We argue that accumulating evidence demonstrates the future benefit or 'option value' of genetic diversity within natural populations when subject to anthropogenic environmental changes. Consequently, the loss of that diversity will hinder their ability to adapt to changing environments and is, therefore, of serious concern.

The sources of these polluting materials are both land- and marine-based, their origins may be local or distant, and the environmental consequences are many and varied. The more widely recognized problems are typically associated with entanglement, ingestion, suffocation and general debilitation, and are often related to stranding events and public perception. Among the less frequently recognized and recorded problems are global hazards to shipping, fisheries and other maritime activities. Today, there are rapidly developing research interests in the biota attracted to freely floating (i.e. pelagic) marine debris, commonly known as 'hangers-on and hitch-hikers' as well as material sinking to the sea floor despite being buoyant.

So, EIA problems need to be modelled and analysed using methods that can handle uncertainties. The evidential reasoning (ER) approach provides such a modelling framework and analysis method. In this paper the ER approach will be applied to conduct EIA analysis for the first time. The environmental impact consequences are characterized by a set of assessment grades that are assumed to be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive. All assessment information, quantitative or qualitative, complete or incomplete, and precise or imprecise, is modelled using a unified framework of a belief structure. The original ER approach with a recursive ER algorithm will be introduced and a new analytical ER algorithm will be investigated which provides a means for using the ER approach in decision situations where an explicit ER aggregation function is needed such as in optimisation problems. The ER approach will be used to aggregate multiple environmental factors, resulting in an aggregated distributed assessment for each alternative policy. A numerical example and its modified version are studied to illustrate the detailed implementation process of the ER approach and demonstrate its potential applications in EIA. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Conserving ecosystem services is now a key normative goal of environmental decision making, but the implications of embracing this concept are still little understood. In this paper I highlight two recurring and cross-cutting aspects of an ecosystems approach around which credible treatments of ecosystem services can be realized, not only in theory, but also in practice: first, the need to think 'holistically' about how any given project, proposal or plan would impact on service provision and human well-being; and, second, the need to manage ecosystem services in relation to wider stakeholder values, needs and priorities. While thinking about decision making from the perspective of ecosystem services is no panacea for sustainability, the paper points to a number of social science issues that interdisciplinary researchers could usefully address in these two contexts if they are to harness this concept in creative and critically engaged ways. © The Author(s) 2011.",2011,"2022-10-11 14:38:32","2022-10-11T14:38:32Z",NA,"671–680","","5","35",NA,NA,"Environmental decision making and an ecosystems ap",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"ecosystem services; ecosystems approach; social science; theory and application","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Warmed communities disproportionately lose top predators and herbivores, and become increasingly dominated by autotrophs and bacterivores. Changes in the relative distribution of organisms among trophically defined functional groups lead to differences in ecosystem function beyond those expected from temperature-dependent physiological rates. Diverse communities retain more species than depauperate ones, as predicted by the insurance hypothesis, which suggests that high biodiversity buffers against the effects of environmental variation because tolerant species are more likely to be found6, 7.

Environmental sensor networks have been established and large new networks are planned for monitoring multiple habitats at many different scales. Projects range in spatial scale from continental systems designed to measure global change and environmental stability to those involved with the monitoring of only a few meters of forest edge in fragmented landscapes. Temporal measurements have ranged from the evaluation of sunfleck dynamics at scales of seconds, to daily CO2 fluxes, to decadal shifts in temperatures. Above-ground sensor systems are partnered with subsurface soil measurement networks for physical and biological activity, together with aquatic and riparian sensor networks to measure groundwater fluxes and nutrient dynamics.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.",2006,"2022-10-11 14:38:30","2022-10-11T14:38:30Z",NA,"","139","","4",NA,NA,"",NA,"1",NA,NA,"Routledge","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOI: 10.2307/3034441",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But it is hard to assess progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for 2011–20 set by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Target 5, for instance, aims to halve global deforestation rates by 2020; but reliable indicators for deforestation that can be monitored remotely have not been developed or agreed on. National biodiversity monitoring programmes differ widely, most data sets are inconsistent, and few data are shared openly. To focus priorities, ecologists have proposed classes of 'essential biodiversity variables' — including species traits and populations, and ecosystem function and structure1. But measuring these on the ground is laborious and limited. Related stories Policy: Development goals should enable decision-making Agriculture: Increase water harvesting in Africa Satellites: Make Earth observations open access More related stories Satellite remote sensing is crucial to getting long-term global coverage. It can rapidly reveal where to reverse the loss of biological diversity on a wide range of scales in a consistent, borderless and repeatable manner2. Quantities such as vegetation productivity or leaf cover can be measured across continents from space. But there is no agreement on how to translate these measurements into metrics that are relevant for biodiversity monitoring. We call on conservation and space agencies to agree on a definitive set of biodiversity variables and how these will be tracked from space, to address conservation targets. Methods to derive these variables and the set of satellites needed to observe them must also be decided, to ensure continuous monitoring. To stimulate discussion, we propose ten variables that capture biodiversity change on the ground and can be monitored from space (see 'Tracking biodiversity'). These range from leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content to seasonal changes in floods and fires. Tracking biodiversity: Ten variables Proposed variables for satellite monitoring of progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Species populations Species occurrence Species traits Plant traits (such as specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content) Ecosystem structure Ecosystem distribution Fragmentation and hetrogeneity Land cover Vegetation height Ecosystem function Fire occurrence Vegetation phenology (variability) Primary productivity and leaf area index Inundation More Missing link Why have researchers been unable to define a standard set of biodiversity variables to monitor from satellites? Because of inadequate access to satellite data; uncertainties in the continuity of observations; and temporal and spatial limitations of satellite imagery. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of communication between the ecology and remote-sensing communities. Historically, land imaging has been less of a focus for Earth observations than, say, weather. For years, access to satellite images was restricted for security or commercial reasons. Now, with more data available from publicly funded space agencies, it is time to push for monitoring of biodiversity change from satellites. For example, individual tree species or animals can be imaged, for a fee, in extreme detail (31-centimetre resolution) by WorldView-3, a private Earth-observation satellite owned by DigitalGlobe of Longmont, Colorado. Biodiversity is hard to quantify. It is not measured in physical units, such as centimetres of precipitation or degrees of temperature. It involves the details of how energy (sunlight, microwaves or laser beams) interacts with living organisms. There is often a mismatch of scales in the definition of remote-sensing and ecological units. For instance, measuring forest degradation from space requires an agreed definition of a forest and of what constitutes degradation. Without these, it is hard to compare forest distribution across a large geographical extent or across time. Definitions change. In the 1990s, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defined forests as ecosystems with a minimum of 10% canopy cover of trees or bamboo associated with wild flora3. That definition was updated in 2005 with a minimum height of 5 metres for trees, while dropping the earlier references to bamboo and wild fauna4. Such shifts influence perceptions of where forests are, as well as where they used to be. USGS Combined, images from Landsat 8 (left) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (centre) show land cover on the Senegal–Guinea border in 2014. Progress is being made. The Landsat satellite series launched in 1972 by NASA was the first of its kind to evolve a global acquisition strategy and to deliver free data5. NASA's Sustainable Land Imaging programme, initiated last year, ensures Landsat-quality data collection for the next 25 years. The Sentinel-2 satellites, part of the European Copernicus programme, will have five-day revisit times and deliver free data until 2028. Advanced sensors to be launched within a decade will provide increasingly accurate information on traits such as vegetation height and plant-species characteristics. These include the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation Lidar and the German Aerospace Center's high-resolution and wide-spectrum satellite EnMAP. Now, ecologists and space agencies must define a joint list of essential biodiversity variables that can be monitored remotely. Some countries have made a start under the CBD-mandated Biodiversity Indicators Partnership global network. For example, the South African National Biodiversity Institute has derived 16 indicators for tracking fresh water, river, coastal and marine habitats6. Some critics argue that deriving information on biodiversity from space on a global level remains to be demonstrated. Because characterizing species traits or ecosystem structure requires data on diverse scales (spatial, temporal and spectral), data from multiple missions must be combined. The growth of open satellite-image archives such as Landsat is leading to more sophisticated data products. For example, maps that show global forest cover change were produced for 2001–13 by the University of Maryland, Google, the US Geological Survey and NASA7. Joined-up thinking between ground-based data providers, space agencies, product engineers, researchers and policy-makers is needed to align the technical specifications of sensors on board satellites and in-product algorithms. “The growth of open satellite-image archives such as Landsat is leading to more sophisticated data products.” We convened two workshops earlier this year to bring together experts from the remote-sensing and ecology communities to generate a list of candidate remotely sensed variables for reporting on the Aichi targets. The meetings, in Leipzig, Germany, and in Frascati, Italy, were funded by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), a network of organizations, scientists and practitioners established in 2008 under the auspices of the intergovernmental GEO. The ten candidates we identified include continuous and biophysical variables such as leaf area as well as threshold-based thematic measures such as land cover. Participants mapped the variables onto the Aichi targets using CBD guidelines6. This was the first time that such a link has been made to inform global environmental policy. The list is meant to stimulate discussion about which variables are most important. For example, vegetation height is key to inferring trends in biomass (and thus reducing deforestation, as in Aichi target 5) and ecosystem services (relevant to Aichi target 15 on restoring degraded ecosystems). Joined-up approach What next? By the end of the year, the GEO BON should develop a plan for refining the list of variables proposed here. The GEO secretariat should promote the use of such variables to the CBD and Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The CBD should review, update and endorse the plan. IPBES should adopt the proposed measures for thematic, regional and global assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Copernicus Sentinel data [2015] Vegetation (red) on Italy's Sardinia, imaged by the European Copernicus Sentinel-2A in 2015. The GEO secretariat should support the definition of a coherent and comprehensive set of remotely sensed biodiversity variables and related products, and pass these requirements to the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS coordinates cooperation between space-agency satellite missions and product development. The GEO BON's plan should be updated with feedback from this process and recirculated. The biodiversity community needs to recognize the potential and limitations of image processing for biodiversity monitoring. Remote-sensing experts should seek a deeper understanding of ecological concepts and requirements to minimize semantic confusion and to ensure that the collected data are used in the most appropriate and useful way. Those working in natural-resource management will need to be trained in biodiversity conservation and remote sensing. Research funding agencies (such as the research directorate of the European Commission and the US National Science Foundation) must lend their support. They should seek proposals for interdisciplinary, multinational case studies that demonstrate the use and impact of remotely sensed biodiversity variables for tracking the impact of conservation actions and environmental policies worldwide.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:38:30","2022-10-11T14:38:30Z",NA,"403–405","","7561","523",NA,NA,"Environmental science",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The resultant mortality of benthic fauna is strongly size dependent. We empirically. demonstrate that beam trawling frequency in the central North Sea had a greater effect on fauna size distribution in a soft sediment benthic community than variables such as sediment particle size and water depth. Accordingly, we simulated the impacts of trawling disturbance on benthos using a model consisting of 37 organism size classes between 1 mug and 140 g wet weight. The model produced a production-biomass versus size relationship consistent with published studies and allowed us to predict the impacts of trawling frequency on benthos size distributions. Outputs were consistent with empirical data; however, at high yet realistic trawling frequencies, the model predicted an extirpation of most macrofauna. Empirical data show that macrofauna persist in many heavily trawled regions; therefore, we suggest that trawling by real fisheries is sufficiently heterogeneous to provide spatial refuges less impacted by trawling. If correct, our analyses suggest that fishery management measures that do not reduce total effort but do lead to effort displacement and spatial homogenization (e.g., temporarily closed areas) may have adverse effects on the systemic persistence of intermediate- and large-sized macrofauna.",2003,"2022-10-11 14:38:30","2022-10-11T14:38:30Z",NA,"1306","","10","60",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using geographical information systems and related tools, the Pacific Northwest Ecosystem Research Consortium depicted historical (pre-EuroAmerican settlement, circa 1850), current (circa 1990), and three alternative future (circa 2050) landscapes for western Oregon's Willamette River Basin. These depictions were used to better understand and anticipate trajectories of change in human occupancy and natural resource condition. During a 30-month period, we worked with lay and professional citizen groups to create, map, and refine a set of value-based assumptions about future policy in three scenarios concerning land and water use. The Plan Trend 2050 scenario represents the expected future landscape in 2050 if current policies are implemented as written and recent trends continue. Development 2050 reflects a loosening of current policies, to allow freer rein to market forces across all components of the landscape, but still within the range of what citizen stakeholders considered plausible. Conservation 2050 places greater emphasis on ecosystem protection and restoration, still reflecting a plausible balance among ecological, social, and economic considerations as defined by the stakeholders. For the Conservation scenario, natural resource managers and scientists provided estimates for the area of key habitats required to sustain, in perpetuity, the array of dependent species. Spatially explicit analyses identified locations biophysically suited to meet the area targets. These locations, titled the Conservation and Restoration Opportunity Areas, were mapped and then reviewed by a series of groups regarding the political plausibility of conserving or restoring them to the indicated vegetation types. The three alternative 2050 futures, as well as the 1850 past conditions, were then evaluated by an array of evaluation models described by others in this issue.

How could futures studies contribute to a policy forming process directed to these problems? And what kind of knowledge about the future is most needed? It is argued that a backcasting approach, due to its problem-solving character, is well suited to these kinds of long-term problems. Fundamental theoretical assumptions behind backcasting are traced. One conclusion is that the merits of backcasting should be judged in the context of discovery rather than in the context of justification. Also, if one is inclined to see teleology as a specific form of understanding, beside causality, then backcasting becomes interesting. Backcasting studies typically aim at providing policy makers and an interested general public with images of the future as a background for opinion forming and decisions.

All rights reserved.Managing ecosystems for multiple ecosystem services and balancing the well-being of diverse stakeholders involves different kinds of trade-offs. Often trade-offs involve noneconomic and difficult-to-evaluate values, such as cultural identity, employment, the well-being of poor people, or particular species or ecosystem structures. Although trade-offs need to be considered for successful environmental management, they are often overlooked in favor of win-wins. Management and policy decisions demand approaches that can explicitly acknowledge and evaluate diverse trade-offs. We identified a diversity of apparent trade-offs in a small-scale tropical fishery when ecological simulations were integrated with participatory assessments of social-ecological system structure and stakeholders' well-being. Despite an apparent win-win between conservation and profitability at the aggregate scale, food production, employment, and well-being of marginalized stakeholders were differentially influenced by management decisions leading to trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs were suggested to be ""taboo""trade-offs between morally incommensurable values, such as between profits and the well-being of marginalized women. These were not previously recognized as management issues. Stakeholders explored and deliberated over trade-offs supported by an interactive ""toy model"" representing key system trade-offs, alongside qualitative narrative scenarios of the future. The concept of taboo trade-offs suggests that psychological bias and social sensitivity may exclude key issues from decision making, which can result in policies that are difficult to implement. Our participatory modeling and scenarios approach has the potential to increase awareness of such trade-offs, promote discussion of what is acceptable, and potentially identify and reduce obstacles to management compliance.",2015,"2022-10-11 14:38:29","2022-10-11T14:38:29Z",NA,"6949–6954","","22","112",NA,NA,"Evaluating taboo trade-offs in ecosystems services",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To restrict its effects, ecological networks such as the trans-European network NATURA2000 are being developed based on the assumption that structural connections between habitat fragments lead to increased exchange through dispersal and a higher viability of (meta)populations. However, there is a great need for techniques that translate these networks and/or structural characteristics of landscapes into functional connectivity for specific organisms. Least-cost analysis has the capacities to fulfill these needs, but has never been validated against actual observations of dispersal paths. Here we present a method to validate the results of a least-cost analysis by comparing realized movement paths of hedgehogs in unfamiliar areas, obtained by radiotracking, with statistics on landscape-wide distribution of cost values. The degree of correspondence between empirical dispersal paths and the output of a least-cost analysis can be visualized and quantified, and least-cost scenarios can be statistically compared. We show that hedgehogs moved along paths with significantly lower cost values than the average landscape, implying that they took better than random routes, but performance was relatively poor. We attribute this to the relatively generalistic habitat use of the model species and the rather homogeneous landscapes. We conclude that this approach can be useful for further validation of the least-cost model and allows a direct comparison of model performance among different taxa and/or landscapes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Many of the recent (global) scenario exercises have been structured according to a Story-and-Simulation approach. Although elaborately studied, conceptual and practical issues remain in linking qualitative stories and quantitative models. In this paper, we show how stakeholders can directly estimate model parameter values using a three-step approach called Fuzzy Set Theory. We focus on the effect of multiple iterations between stories and models. Results show that we were successful in quickly delivering stakeholder-based quantification of key model parameters, with full consistency between linguistic terms used in stories and numeric values. Yet, values changed strongly from one iteration to the next. A minimum of two and preferably at least three iterations is needed to harmonise stories and models. We conclude that the application of Fuzzy Set Theory enabled a highly valuable, structured and reproducible process to increase consistency between stories and models, but that future work is needed to show its true potential, particularly related to the effect of iterations. Additionally, the number of tools that need to be applied in a short period of time to execute a Story-And-Simulation approach introduces drawbacks that need to be studied.

Location The fire-prone Fynbos biome (Cape Floristic Region, South Africa). Methods Our process-based models have a spatially explicit demographic submodel (describing dispersal, reproduction, mortality and local extinction) as well as an observation submodel (describing imperfect detection of individuals), and are constrained by species-specific predictions of habitat distribution models and process-based models for seed dispersal by wind. Free model parameters were varied to find parameter sets with the highest likelihood. After testing this approach with simulated data, we applied it to eight Proteaceae species that differ in breeding system (monoecy versus dioecy) and adult fire survival. We assess the importance of Allee effects and negative density dependence for range dynamics, by using the Akaike information criterion to select between alternative models fitted for the same species. Results The best model for all dioecious study species included Allee effects, whereas this was true for only one of four monoecious species. As expected, sprouters (in which adults survive fire) were estimated to have lower rates of reproduction and catastrophic population extinction than related non-sprouters. Overcompensatory population dynamics seem important for three of four non-sprouters. We also found good quantitative agreement between independent data and most estimates of reproduction, carrying capacity and extinction probability. Main conclusions This study shows that process-based models can quantitatively describe how large-scale abundance distributions arise from the movement and interaction of individuals. It stresses links between the life history, demography and range dynamics of Proteaceae: dioecious species seem more susceptible to Allee effects which reduce migration ability and increase local extinction risk, and sprouters seem to have high persistence of established populations, but their low reproduction limits habitat colonization and migration",2010,"2022-10-11 14:38:29","2022-10-11T14:38:29Z",NA,"85–97","","1","19",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Allee effect; Demography; Hybrid models; Mechanistic species distribution; Model selection; Negative density dependence; Overcompensation; Population dynamics; Serotinous proteaceae; Wind dispersal","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Adaptive management is becoming an increasingly popular management-decision tool within the scientific community and has developed into two primary schools of thought: the Resilience-Experimentalist School (with high emphasis on stakeholder involvement, resilience, and highly complex models) and the Decision-Theoretic School (which results in relatively simple models through emphasizing stakeholder involvement for identifying management objectives). Because of these differences, adaptive management plans implemented under each of these schools may yield varying levels of success. We evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on incorporation of adaptive management to identify components of successful adaptive management plans. Our evaluation included adaptive management elements such as stakeholder involvement, definitions of management objectives and actions, use and complexity of predictive models, and the sequence in which these elements were applied. We also defined a scale of degrees of success to make comparisons between the two adaptive management schools of thought. Our results include the relationship between the adaptive management process documented in the reviewed literature and our defined continuum of successful outcomes. Our data suggest an increase in the number of published articles with substantive discussion of adaptive management from 2000 to 2009 at a mean rate of annual change of 0.92 (r2 = 0.56). Additionally, our examination of data for temporal patterns related to each school resulted in an increase in acknowledgement of the Decision-Theoretic School of thought at a mean annual rate of change of 0.02 (r2 = 0.6679) and a stable acknowledgement for the Resilience-Experimentalist School of thought (r2 = 0.0042; slope = 0.0013).

Remote-sensing-based approaches to continental-scale estimation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) have been developed but coarse spatial resolution is a source of errors. Here we demonstrate a satellite-based method of estimating NEE using Landsat TM/ETM+data and an upscaling framework. The upscaling framework contains flux-footprint climatology modeling, modified regression tree (MRT) analysis and image fusion. By scaling NEE measured at flux towers to landscape and regional scales, this satellite-based method can improve NEE estimation at high spatial-temporal resolution at the landscape scale relative to methods based on MODIS data with coarser spatial-temporal resolution. This method was applied to sixteen flux sites from the Canadian Carbon Program and AmeriFlux networks located in North America, covering forest, grass, and cropland biomes. Compared to a similar method using MODIS data, our estimation is more effective for diagnosing landscape NEE with the same temporal resolution and higher spatial resolution (30m versus 1km) (r2=0.7548 vs. 0.5868, RMSE=1.3979 vs. 1.7497gCm-2day-1, average error=0.8950 vs. 1.0178gCm-2day-1, relative error=0.47 vs. 0.54 for fused Landsat and MODIS imagery, respectively). We also compared the regional NEE estimations using Carbon Tracker, our method and eddy-covariance observations.

Quantitative models generally measured single risk components (78% of studies), often focusing on Establishment alone (79%).

Here, using nonlinear regressions within an information theoretical model selection framework, we included uncertainty regarding both model selection and parameter estimation in SAR modeling and conducted a global-scale analysis of the form of SARs for vascular plants and major vertebrate groups across 792 terrestrial ecoregions representing almost 97% of Earth's inhabited land. The results revealed a high level of uncertainty in model selection across biomes and taxa, and that the power-law model is clearly the most appropriate in only a minority of cases. Incorporating this uncertainty into a hotspots analysis using multimodel SARs led to the identification of a dramatically different set of global richness hotspots than when the power-law SAR was assumed.

In the early 1970s Tversky and Kahneman published a series of papers on 'heu- ristics and biases' describing human inadequacies in assessing probabilities, culminating in a highly popular article in Science. This seminal research has been heavily cited in many fields, including statistics, as the definitive research on probability assessment. Curiously, although this work was debated at the time and more recent work has largely refuted many of the claims, this apparent heuristics and biases bias in elicitation research has gone unremarked. Over a decade of research into the frequency effect, the importance of framing, and cognitive mod- els more generally, has been almost completely ignored by the statistical literature on expert elicitation.

The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the 'truth' of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.",1996,"2022-10-11 14:38:25","2022-10-11T14:38:25Z",NA,"229–244","","","90",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, five AOGCMs for the twentieth century (20C3M 1970–1999) and three SRES scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) were used. The performance in downscaling of the temporal neural network was compared to that of an autocorrelation statistical downscaling model with emphasis on its ability to reproduce the observed climate variability and tendency for the period 1970–1999.

The guidelines make it possible to draft both global and regional or sub-global lists, keeping in mind the relationship between the populations being assessed and neighbouring populations. The present work results from the application of this methodology. It aims to update the previous Red List of breeding birds in Italy and to bridge the methodological and temporal gap that for many years has prevented Italy from availing itself of an important tool for bird conservation and planning. We considered a totol of 270 specie: 51.1% were classified as Least Concern (LC),9.6% as Near-Threatened (NT), while 27.3% are in one of the three threatened categories: 2.2% Critically Endangered (CR), 8.1% Endangered (EN) and 17% Vulnerable (VU). The data for 3.3% of the species assessed was not sufficient to assign them to a threat category, and they were thus classified as Data Deficient (DD). Finally, three species that were classified as Regionally Extinct (RE) in the previous Red List of Breeding Birds in Italy were confirmed as such. A total of six species were classified as Critically Endangered (CR), of which four are raptors (Lammergeier, Egyptian Vulture, Griffon Vulture, Bonelli's Eagle) and two are passerines (Sedge Warbler, Barred Warbler). At the level of orders, Anseriformes is the taxon with the highest percentage of threatened or near-threatened species (55.6%), followed by Gruiformes (54.6%) and Accipitriformes (53.8%). Unfortunately it was not possible to effectively compare the current Red List with the previous one, as there are significant methodological differences between them. The current work follows IUCN guidelines for regional red lists, which had not yet been drafted when the previous Red List of Breeding Birds in Italy was prepared. Nevertheless, it clearly emerges that the number of threatened passerines increased from 21.7% to 31%. This finding may in part depend on improved knowledge about population trends iwidespread species, or it may truly reflect the worsening of the conservation status of many passerine species over the last decade. Current knowledge on breeding birds in Italy has made it possible to classify the vast majority of the species that were assessed, in spite that information is still limited for many species. In the immediate future, research efforts should target priority species for conservation and species for which information is limited. © 2012 CISO - Centro Italiano Studi Ornitologici.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:25","2022-10-11T14:38:25Z",NA,"11–58","","1","36",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","Italian",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Breeding species; Conservation; Italy; Red List; Threat","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models' assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5.Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MaxEnt provide a forward step.",2010,"2022-10-11 14:38:24","2022-10-11T14:38:24Z",NA,"330–342","","4","1",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reducing the uncertainties around scientific models has long been perceived as the cure of the fisheries management problem. There is however increasing recognition that uncertainty in the numbers will remain. A lack of transparency with respect to these uncertainties can damage the credibility of science. The EU Commission's proposal for a reformed Common Fisheries Policy calls for more self-management for the fishing industry by increasing fishers' involvement in the planning and execution of policies and boosting the role of fishers' organisations. One way of higher transparency and improved participation is to include stakeholders in the modelling process itself. The JAKFISH project (Judgment And Knowledge in Fisheries Involving StakeHolders) invited fisheries stakeholders to participate in the process of framing the management problem, and to give input and evaluate the scientific models that are used to provide fisheries management advice. JAKFISH investigated various tools to assess and communicate uncertainty around fish stock assessments and fisheries management. Here, a synthesis is presented of the participatory work carried out in four European fishery case studies (Western Baltic herring, North Sea Nephrops, Central Baltic Herring and Mediterranean swordfish), focussing on the uncertainty tools used, the stakeholders' responses to these, and the lessons learnt. It is concluded that participatory modelling has the potential to facilitate and structure discussions between scientists and stakeholders about uncertainties and the quality of the knowledge base. It can also contribute to collective learning, increase legitimacy, and advance scientific understanding. However, when approaching real-life situations, modelling should not be seen as the priority objective. Rather, the crucial step in a science-stakeholder collaboration is the joint problem framing in an open, transparent way. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,"2022-10-11 14:38:24","2022-10-11T14:38:24Z",NA,"1072–1085","","5","36",NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Extended peer review; Fisheries management; Participatory modelling; Post-normal science; Problem framing; Uncertainty","/unread","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
